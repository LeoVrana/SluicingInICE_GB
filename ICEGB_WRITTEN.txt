<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #4:1>
With these profound words J. N. L. Myres begins his book &lsquo; The English Settlements &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #5:1>
although the statement may seem obvious it does demonstrate the difficulties faced by any historian attempting to tackle the period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #6:1>
The problem lies in the paucity and the confusing nature of the sources currently available as well as controversy arising over their interpretation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #7:1>
The essential theme of the Fifth and Sixth centuries appears to be whether Britain went through either cataclysm or relative continuity prior to the emergence of Anglo-Saxon England and the celtic kingdoms of the Early Medieval Period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #8:1>
Before trying to answer the question it is worthwhile highlighting briefly some of the differences between current historians .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #9:1>
In recent years several schools of thought have emerged , each championed by leading exponents of the period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #10:1>
Thompson , Arnold and Myres regard the era as one of cataclysm in which the native British population either fled or died .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #11:1>
Alcock , Johnson and the late Dr. Morris refute this theory , depicting the period as one in which a sub-Roman culture flourished , enabling considerable continuity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #12:1>
Dr. D. Dumville , M. Miller and the late K. Hughes have made a strong case for reductionism and have attempted to minimize the history of sub-Roman Britain to a bare core of historical fact .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #13:1>
Fortunately between these extreme ( and often acrimonious ) views there are some moderate , constructive theories held principally by J. Campbell , P. Salway and the late Sir F. Stenton .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #14:1>
This diversity of opinion is a direct consequence of the difficulties and uncertainties created by the source material ( both written and archaeological ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #15:1>
The series of events beginning in the late fourth century , which led to the end of Roman Britain , provide an important background to the question and are worth outlining .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #16:1>
The unsuccessful intervention of Magnus Maximus into continental politics between 383-88 A.D. along with a considerable portion of the British army , set a dangerous precedent , which the usurper Constantine III followed in 407 A.D. with disastrous consequences .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #17:1>
As a result of Constantine 's foray into Gaul and Spain between 407-411 A.D. , which involved the effective remainder of the Roman garrison , Britain became independent from imperial control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #18:1>
According to the Greek historian Zosimus ( who wrote at the end of the sixth century ) &ldquo; The Britons took up arms and fighting for themselves , freed the cities from the barbarian pressure , expelling the Roman officials and setting up their own administration as well as they could &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #19:1>
The Gallic Chronicle written in c. 452 A.D. confirms the barbarian enemy to have been a major Saxon raid .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #20:1>
It is from this point onwards that Roman Britain ceases to exist and the history of sub-Roman Britain begins .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #21:1>
E. A. Thompson 's argument that the British victors of 410 A.D. were Bacaudae , similar to those in Armoria Armorica , is unlikely and is effectively disproved by the events immediately following 410 A.D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #22:1>
Most written sources agree ( Zosimus , Procopius , Constantius and Gildas ) that following the ejection of the Roman officials , Britain enjoyed a period of relative prosperity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #23:1>
The administrative classes appear to have benefitted most , because freed from central government they were able to enrich themselves by using the Imperial taxation system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #24:1>
These civilian aristocrats seem to have used the old civitates as power bases .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #25:1>
Gildas and Constantius ( the fifth century biographer of St. Germanus ) hint at powerful individuals , the most prominent being Vortigern , Elafius ( an official , described by Constantius , of &lsquo; tribunal &rsquo; rank ) , Vitolinus and Ambrosius .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #26:1>
Welsh annals dating from the ninth century ( possibly earlier ) mention conflict between Vitolinus and Ambrosius at the battle of Wallop .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #27:1>
This has been given the date of c.427 A.D , twelve years after Vortigern 's rise to power , which is usually dated as being in c.425 A.D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #28:1>
Myres and to a lesser extent Thompson see this as being a power struggle between a Pelagian party ( Vitolinus and Vortigern ) and a pro-Imperial catholic party ( Ambrosius ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #29:1>
While this is an attractive theory there is little or no contemporary evidence ( even Constantius ' life of St Germanus sheds very little light on the problem ) to support it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #30:1>
The conflict could have just as well been over the seizure and control of Imperial estates , granaries and potteries left vacant after the expulsion of Constantine 's officials in 410 A.D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #31:1>
From this point onwards the fifth century is best described as a political hiatus , in which any events portrayed are at best only credible traditions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #32:1>
Only two sources , Gildas ' De Excidio and the Gallic Chronicle of c.452 A.D. ( recently authenticated by Casey and Jones in Britannia 19 ( 1988 ) , give any useful information .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #33:1>
The Gallic Chronicle laconically states that in 441 A.D. : &ldquo; Britain , which up to this time had manifold devastations and accidents , was subjected to the domination of the Saxons &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #34:1>
According to Gildas ( and most traditional legends ) between c.425 A.D. and c.442 A.D. Vortigern employed Saxon foederati to defend Britain from the Picts , Irish and not least the pro-Imperial party in Britain led by Ambrosius .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #35:1>
Gildas dates the Saxon revolt to 446 A.D. ( which was later amended to 449 A.D. by Bede ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #36:1>
This rebellion appears to have initiated a period of conflict and considerable dislocation , culminating in a British victory at Mons Badonicus between c.490 A.D. and c.516 A.D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #37:1>
It is during this period that Arthur may have fought the Saxons but so little hard evidence exists , that he must at best remain a shadowy figure .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #38:1>
There also seems to have been considerable Irish settlement in South Wales ( mainly Dyfed ) by the Deisi , possibly North Wales ( the Lleyn Peninsular Peninsula and Anglesey ) by the Laigin , as well as Western Scotland .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #39:1>
The settlements of South West Wales had the greatest significance and impact .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #40:1>
Professor Davies points out : &ldquo; The combined implications of Irish and Welsh genealogies would suggest a time shortly after 400 for settlement in the South West &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #41:1>
These same regnal lists combined with inscriptions found on Stone Pillars throughout Wales ( the Pillar of Eliseg being the most famous ) also suggests considerable Irish involvement in the politics of South Western Wales .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #42:1>
The expulsion of the Irish from Gwynedd has traditionally been attributed to Conedda Cunedda , who may have been the ancestor of Maelgwn .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #43:1>
The theory that he was deliberately relocated from Manau Goddodin ( South Eastern Scotland ) to Gwynedd by either the Romans or Vortigern has largely been discredited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #44:1>
This conflict between Saxons , Britons ( who in all probability fought amongst themselves as well ) and Irish resulted in considerable political and social changes in Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #45:1>
By c. 500 A.D. several small kingdoms are apparent in Estern Western England and Wales loosely based around old Roman provincial centres .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #46:1>
The sixth century kingdoms of Gwent and Ergyng derive their names from Venta Silorum Silurum and Ariconium respectively .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #47:1>
A British enclaeve enclave in the Chilterns ( Bucks and Beds ) seems to have been centred on Verulamium , which appears to have survived well into the fifth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #48:1>
Another British kingdom in Shropshire and Eastern Wales had its centre at Wroxeter ( Virconium ) until the death of its final ruler Cynddylan c.656-658 A.D. at the hands of the Mercians .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #49:1>
Several hillforts also appear to have been refortified c.500 A.D. , the classic examples being South Cadbury and Dinas Powys ( both extensively excavated by L. Alcock in the &rsquo; 60s and early &rsquo; 70s ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #50:1>
Both Gildas and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ( which is unfortunately another unreliable source dated to between the seventh and ninth centuries ) mention kingdoms in Western Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #51:1>
Gildas probably wrote the De Excidio between c.540 A.D. and c.547 A.D. ( the conventional date for the death of Maelgwn of Gwynedd ) and refers to six living British rulers in Wales and South Western Britain , of whom Maelgwn was the most notable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #52:1>
More importantly he indicates that they are at least the second generation of rulers which therefore roughly dates the emergence of these kingdoms to c.500 A.D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #53:1>
The Anglo-Saxon Chroncile Chronicle states that in 577 A.D. : &ldquo; Ceawlin fought against the Britons and slew three kings , Conmail , Condidan and Farinmail , at the place which is called Dyrham
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #54:1>
&semi; and and they captured three cities , Gloucester , Cirencester , and Bath &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #55:1>
This statement appears to indicate the existence of three mid sixtth sixth century British kingdoms based on the old Roman civitates .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #56:1>
Between the last quarter of the sixth century and the first half of the seventh the remaining British kingdoms in England were overrun by the Anglo-Saxons .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #57:1>
The Chiltern enclave was destroyed by c.571 A.D. ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #58:1>
the northern kingdoms of Rheged and Elmet ceased to exist in the immediate decades following the British defeat at Catreath ( Catterick ) in c.590 A.D. (
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #59:1>
this dating was provided by the late K. Hughes ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #60:1>
This meant that following the Anglo-Saxon victory at Chester c.616 A.D. the British kingdoms were restricted to Cornwwall Cornwall , Wales and Strathclyde .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #61:1>
One by-product of the Deirian Deiran advances in Northern England may have been the consolidation of the British kingdom of Strathclyde based on Alcuit ( Dumbarton Rock ) and the emergence of the Irish kingdom of Dalriada .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #62:1>
The reasons for the destruction of the British lowland kingdoms date back to the end of Roman Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #63:1>
During the latter half of the fourth century the Roman Empire went into economic decline , which directly affected Britain , due to overtaxation and inflationary pressure from an unproductive population .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #64:1>
In Britain archaeological findings indicate a serious fall in the number and condition of the villas and estates .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #65:1>
The towns and cities appear to have slowly decayed during the early fifth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #66:1>
Archaeological surveys ( Arnold , Johnson ) have only found evidence for continuity of occupation into the late fifth and sixth centuries in a small handful - Verulamium , Wroxeter and Winchester for example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #67:1>
None of the three cities mentioned by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle demonstrates any signs of habitation after the late fifth century ( which throws serious doubt on the usefulness of the Chronicle at this stage ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #68:1>
Gildas complains that even after the victory at Mount Badon : &ldquo; Our cities are still not occupied as they were &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #69:1>
even today they are dismal and deserted ruins &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #70:1>
The use of coinage in Roman Britain appears to have ceased c.420 A.D. amost almost at the same time that the pottery factories ceased production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #71:1>
This was probably the direct consequence of the withdrawal of the Roman army and administration .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #72:1>
The loss of their principal market combined with falling levels of population caused by plague ( frequently mentioned by Gildas ) , famine and migration , meant that by the middle of the fifth century towns were no longer economically viable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #73:1>
In E. A. Thompson 's opinion the breakdown was extremely severe :
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #74:1>
&ldquo; if we may trust Gildas - and in this connexion there seems no reason why we should not do so - the disruption of the British economy was more devastating than that of Gaul and Spain &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #75:1>
The combination of this economic recession with disruptions caused by full-scale Saxon settlement appears to have resulted in considerable migration .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #76:1>
This seems to have occured occurred throughout the period with several localities ( Wales , Loire , Normandy and Brittany ) as the ultimate destination of the Britons .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #77:1>
The transition of the Church from being predominantly urban to being essentially rural in nature can be seen as a consequence of these movements .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #78:1>
According to Myres : &ldquo; A general cessation of town life at this moment helps to explain the total disappearance of the urban episcopate &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #79:1>
This comment appears to indicate that the migration was primarily amongst the clerical and aristocratic classes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #80:1>
This assumption is supported by the nature of the Latin used in the Llandaff Charters , some of which have been shown to date from the second quarter of the sixth century ( 72a , the grant from Perbio Peibio to Dubricius clearly demonstrates the point ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #81:1>
There are also overall changes in Welsh around this time , incorporating some administrative Latin vocabulary .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #82:1>
The British settlements in Gaul during the fifth and sixth centuries , which culminated in Armorica becoming known as Brittany , also appear to have involved the upper strata of British society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #83:1>
Settlements around the lower Loire contained both a British Bishop and military leader ( Mansuetes Mansuetus and Riothiamus Riothamus ) , who may have been invited over by pro-Roman factions to combat the Goths ( and Saxons ) in the area .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #84:1>
There is also substantial evidence both literary and archaeological , which demonstrates that the British peasanty peasantry remained throughout England .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #85:1>
St. Guthlac mentions communities of Britons in the Fens , while the laws of Ine and Aethelbert ( Kings of Wessex and Kent in the early seventh century ) makes references to a British underclass , known as Laet <unclear-characters> in Kent .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #86:1>
The survival of Celtic river names throughout England supports this view , while Alcock goes even further to declare that in the North : &ldquo; The conclusion is inescapable that in Bernicia a very small and largely aristocratic Anglian element ruled over a predominantly British population &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #87:1>
The ease with which the Saxons overran lowland England can possibly be explained in the following terms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #88:1>
Southern England had become a civilised area by the second century , so that with the departure of the Roman army and official classes no social structure existed capable of providing a coherent defence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #89:1>
Both Wales and the North had never progressed beyond being military zones , so that there was no structure of government to be destroyed and consequently they were much harder to subdue .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #90:1>
This then poses the question of whether there was continuity or massacre during the fifth and sixth centuries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #91:1>
Most modern historians agree that the conservative view ( held by Myres , Thompson and Arnold ) of the British <unclear-word> being massacred is no longer tenable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #92:1>
Salway firmly declares : &ldquo; There is no sign of a calamity sweeping the cities of Britain at any one date &rdquo; , while Alcock goes one step further : &ldquo; In other words archaeology provides no evidence in support of the view that the end of romanized urban life came as a result of the military activities of rebellious Saxon mercenaries &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #93:1>
Depopulation due to plague and migration in the fifth and sixth centuries appear to be responsible for the demise of the lowland British kingdoms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #94:1>
Unfortunately the case for continuity is equally weak &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #95:1>
Finberg 's thesis based on the villa at Withington has more to do with geographical factors than archaeological evidence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #96:1>
Even Alcock concludes , albeit unwillingly , that &ldquo; There is no other archaeological evidence ( in Gloucester , Cirencester and Bath ) to sustain a case for continuity &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-001 #X97:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #1:1>
T. J. Monks
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #X2:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #3:1>
Adomnan wrote about the deeds of the founder of his monastery , Saint Columba .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #4:1>
Although Adomnan wrote about these C6 <unclear-characters> events , his work can , to an extent , be of value for <unclear-characters> evidence of C7 structure of society and nature of polotics politics .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #5:1>
The deeds of Columba had been transmitted verbally until Adomnan committed them to paper ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #6:1>
therefore , although the gist remained it is likely that when recounting the deeds they were told the context of the period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #7:1>
Adomnan 's christian bias can be clearly seen in his &lsquo; Life of Columba &rsquo; and presumably a C7 bias accompanies it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #8:1>
However &semi; Adomnan him<l>self admits to leaving out &lsquo; some unfamiliar words of the Irish tonge tongue , a poor language , designations of men or names of tribes and places &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #9:1>
Throughout Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; there are references to social status and the structure of society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #10:1>
There are many references to &lsquo; tribes and provinces &rsquo; and these suggest that Ireland was divided into many small kingdoms , &lsquo; Tuatha &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #11:1>
However , above these &lsquo; kings &rsquo; Adomnan refers to overkings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #12:1>
In Book 1 chapter 14 Adomnan recounts Columbus Columba , whilst in Ireland , talks to Aid Cononan and warns him against loosing losing the perogative prerogative of monarchy over the kingdom of all Ireland ...
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #13:1>
&lsquo; for if you ever commit that sin , you will enjoy not the whole kingdom of your father , but only some part of it , in your own tribe &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #14:1>
This would suggest that the overkingship was hereditary , however
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #15:1>
it was not stable and the overkingship had to be constantly inforced enforced .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #16:1>
Under the Overking 's control were the kings of the many small Tuatha .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #17:1>
Adomnan constantly refers to these minor kings and puts them in the context of a geneology genealogy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #18:1>
Whilst talking in Chapter 22 of Book II of the &lsquo; royal &rsquo; family of Gabran he mentions a man &lsquo; by name of Ioan , son of Conall , son of Domnall &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #19:1>
Adomnan also refers to possesions possessions that infer wealth and status .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #20:1>
In Book II Ch. 8 a man is described riding a horse and carrying a satchel of books &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #21:1>
both the horse and the books infer wealth and status and suggest a fairly stable society if it is possible to feed the horse through the winter months resulting in the forfeit of fodder for cattle .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #22:1>
Another reference concerns hunting-dogs and the same principle applies to make these status indicators .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #23:1>
Many of the monks mentioned by Adomnan were perported purported to have been of noble birth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #24:1>
Columbus Columba , and even Adomnan himself , were of the Ui Neill family .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #25:1>
One of Columbus ' monks was Colcu , son of Aid Draigniche of the descendants of f&eacute;chr&eacute; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #26:1>
There is also a mocu prefix mocu - , for many of the surnames mentioned in Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #27:1>
four founders of monasteries had this prefix element in their names ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #28:1>
Adomnan mentions an old priest recounting one of Columba 's deeds who was called &lsquo; Oissene , Ernan 's son , of the family Mocu-Neth Con , and St finten , who's whose father was Tailchan , was of the family Mocu-Moic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #29:1>
Was this prefix , Mocu - , an indication of status ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #30:1>
It would seem so , as most of the leading priests and saints had this element in their family names and those who did not were of royal birth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #31:1>
Is this an indication that the social structure within the church mirrored that in secular society ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #32:1>
The relationship of foster-parents has been frequently refered referred to in Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #33:1>
In book II ch. 7 there is reference to Colcu , <unclear-characters> Cellac 's son , and his sister and foster-mother who owned her own cottage .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #34:1>
Were these &lsquo; milk-mothers &rsquo; employed by noble families to raise their children ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #35:1>
Adomnan refers to Columbus 's Columba 's foster-father , the priest Cruithnechan , and it seems that he was responsible for Columbus 's Columba 's instruction in the Scriptures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #36:1>
Colubus Columba , himself was Baithene 's foster-father .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #37:1>
There are also references of Noble noble sons joining other nobles ' retinues as a sort of apprenticeship .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #38:1>
Was this a sign of mutual trust and alliance between noble families and was this simil<l>ar to the entrusting their sons into the care of abbots to learn the scriptures ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #39:1>
Again there is the possible mirroring of structure of society , &semi; however ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #40:1>
did this continue into the C7 or is it an example of Adomnan 's bias ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #41:1>
Within the ecclesiastic society many different races were integrated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #42:1>
There is reference to pictish priests , English monks , British monks , whilst the majority were Irish .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #43:1>
This , however , did not occur in the secular society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #44:1>
Adomnan refers in Book I to two monks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #45:1>
Also in ch. 20 of Book <unclear-word> there is reference to Batram , a monk of Columbus Columba , who died and was buried in the oakwood of Calcach .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #46:1>
Other chapters refer to the oakwood of Durrow .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #47:1>
At these focal points of pagan origin monasteries were built .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #48:1>
Is this due to tradition or is it an active approach to reaffirm christianities Christianity 's influence over paganism ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #49:1>
Adomnan refers to the agricultural activity of the monks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #50:1>
Monks were described as labouring in the fields , threshing grain , and one english English monk was described as the baker .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #51:1>
There is also mention of a forge at the monastery on Iona .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #52:1>
Presumably , Adomnan was dress<l>ing ordinary agriculture and production in terms of the monks monks ' labour , and that these activities were carried out by the peasants that he refers to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #53:1>
Adomnan also refers to snares and nets for hunting and fishing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #54:1>
In Book I ch. 41 Adomnan mentions a poet 's visit to Iona and that it was traditional to ask for a song as the poet left .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #55:1>
This gives evidence of a method of perpetuating tradition and distribution of news .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #56:1>
Servants and slaves are refered referred to , in Book I ch 17 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #57:1>
Colcu , Aid Draigniche 's son , is apparently , had a &lsquo; butler &rsquo; , and slavery is mentioned in Book II , ch. 37 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #58:1>
14C : . Thiefs
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #59:1>
thieves and beggars are also referred to in Adomnan 's &lsquo; Life of Columba &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #60:1>
In book II ch 21 Adomnan tells of &lsquo; a niggardly rich man , Vigenus &rsquo; who didn't recieve receive Columbus Columba into his house .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #61:1>
Colubus Columba then prophesed prophesied that he would become a beggar and that his son would run from house to house with a half empty bag and that he would die in the trench of a threshing-floor .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #62:1>
There is also reference to the Bishop of Cul-rathin who collected gifts from the people to feed Columbus Columba .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #63:1>
Was there then a mirroring of taxation in the form of being bound to house and entertain the king or neld on progress around his territory ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #64:1>
It also seems allow<l>able to beg if you are a &lsquo; deserving person &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #65:1>
There are nine references to the Picts and Pict<l>land in Adomnan 's Life of Columba .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #66:1>
Adomnan 's Christian bias is all too evident in these references .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #67:1>
He frequently calls the Picts heathens and barbarians , and recounts in Book I ch. 37 Columba 's christian defiance of singing vespers outside King Brude 's fortress whereupon the king 's majician magician , Broichan , was despatched to defeat Columba and failed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #68:1>
&lsquo; The majicians magicians , whom he often repelled in confusion and defeat &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #69:1>
There were also &lsquo; rich laymen &rsquo; within the pictish society , &semi; was this Adomnan using C7 societal terminology ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #70:1>
In Book II ch 32 Adomnan states that an interpreter was needed to talk to the picts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #71:1>
Although this is important evidence of a separate language it still leaves the question of the nature , :
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #72:1>
was it Britonic or non-indo European ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #73:1>
In this same chapter reference of the pictish religion is made , to their &lsquo; many gods &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #74:1>
In Book II ch. 33 Adom<l>nan tells of King Brude and his majician magician holding an Irish woman captive as a slave and also terms Broi<l>chan , the majician magician , as Brude 's foster-father .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #75:1>
Whilst implying social structure , Adomnan still seems to be using his own C7 terminology .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #76:1>
In chapter 42 Columba is supposed to have asked King Brude to assure safe passage for some of his monks to the Orkney Islands so that they would escape &lsquo; imminent death &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #77:1>
The king implication is that King Brude was the overking of the king of the Orkneys , but the Latin term in the orig<l>inal text may also be translated as royal agent .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #78:1>
However the underlying implication is that King Brude was the sole king of the Picts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #79:1>
Adomnan mentions points of law which seem to be a statement of C7 law .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #80:1>
In Book II ch. 37 Adomnan recounts the tale of Columba blessing a spike , for a beggar which is then supposed to kill any lawful game .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #81:1>
<unclear-word> a firm point of law can be seen in the wife 's statement &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #82:1>
In chapter 39 of the same book Adomnan tells of a man who was convicted of murder and was then held in chains as one condemned , &semi; however ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #83:1>
he was saved by a wealthy relative , who in return , expected service from the condemned man for the rest of his life .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #84:1>
Was this bribary bribery , or an accepted perogative prerogative of the rich relative ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #85:1>
The C7 political nature of Ireland and Scotland is difficult to ascertain from Adomnans Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #86:1>
In Book I ch. 36 Adomnan refers to kings fighting for supremacy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #87:1>
Aid surname Black a Cruithnian by race and of royal lineage was a slayer of men and had killed Diormit , Cerball 's son &lsquo; who had been ordained by God 's will , as the ruler of all Ireland &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #88:1>
So Adomnan 's Christian bias is evident , but it does give an insight into the political situation of the stability of the overking<l>ship of Ireland .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #89:1>
Was this challenge an occcasional occasional event or commonplace ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #90:1>
Whenever Adomnan mentions battles in &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; he stresses the victor and their geneology genealogy and their successors .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #91:1>
In fact this need to record families is a strong theme throughout the book .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #92:1>
Does this denote an unstable hierarchical structure , both politically and socially in the C7 ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #93:1>
In Book I chs 18 and 19 Adomnan recounts the battle of Maithi Miathi where king Aidan was threa<l>tened by the barbarians .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #94:1>
Before the Battle Columbus Columba questioned Aidan about &lsquo; a successor to the kingdom &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #95:1>
This may be Adomnan 's C7 need to indicate Columba 's prophetic qualities and to set down a record of the royal line , because Columbus Columba is supposed to have predicted the events at battle and the successor .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #96:1>
Although Aidan won two of his sons , Artuir and Echoidfind were killed at Maithi Miathi , another son , Domingart , was killed in a rout battle in England and it was Ehoid Buide who was Aidan 's successor and Columbus predicted that his children would follow .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #97:1>
So a political concern can be seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #98:1>
There are references to political exile and hostages taken in Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #99:1>
In Book I ch. 11 Scandlan , Colman 's son , was held by Aid ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #100:1>
after Aids Aid 's death he was exiled , reigned his own people for thirty years and was then exiled again .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #101:1>
So it seems that if his captor dies exile is the only alternative to keep a politically undesirable person out of affairs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #102:1>
In Book I ch 13 there is reference to Oingus , son of Aid Conunan and his two brothers exiled to Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #103:1>
This gives an example of the political nature if to block a threat the children of an adversary are exiled .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #104:1>
In Book I ch 49 there is also mention of a conference of kings in the ridge of Cete in the fortress of Ceth
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #105:1>
And , again in Book II ch 35 another council is mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #106:1>
This shows a political situation in contrast to the Battle and exile , and indicates a fairly stable society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #107:1>
The Councils are mirrored by the Irish synod mentioned in Book II ch. 45 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #108:1>
Presumably the Easter debate was discussed there .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #109:1>
Book I ch 3 &lsquo; concerning the great dispute that after many days arose among the chur<l>ches of Ireland over the diversity in time of the Easter festival &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #110:1>
Does the Easter debate indicate conflict between the monasteries of Ireland ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #111:1>
Travel is frequent in Adomnan 's &lsquo; life of Columba &rsquo; especially by sea .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #112:1>
This would seem to indicate a fairly stable political situation , &semi; however
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #113:1>
instances of an &lsquo; evil pursuer &rsquo; who burnt down a village in which he thought Adomnan Columba was staying whilst in pictland and the need to ask for safe passage may not seem that stable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #114:1>
Trade with Gaulish sailors is also ment<l>ioned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #115:1>
It can be concluded that Adomnan 's life of Columba is of value for the structure of society which seems not to have changed greatly between Columba 's time and Adomnan .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #116:1>
A clear hierarchical structure can be seen of &semi; : Overking , king , nobles , priests , rich laymen , bards and poets , peasant laymen , servants , slaves , beggars and thieves .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #117:1>
However the political nature is less clear ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #118:1>
infighting for supremacy including tactics of hostages and exiles occurred .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #119:1>
There was great stress on establishing geneologies genealogies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #120:1>
And although battles occurred , the kings met for councils also , although this may have been branches of families only .
<ICE-GB:W1A-002 #121:1>
Throughout the work Adomnan 's christian bias is a constant reminder that this is a christian work and that when assesing assessing its value of this has to be considered .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #X1:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #2:1>
At certain times during the period it does appear that Frankish control descended upon Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #3:1>
However , this control was on the surface only and didn't exist in practical terms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #4:1>
Yet this is not to argue that the Franks didn't influence the peninsula , and that Brittany did not react to the Franks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #5:1>
The Franks did make great efforts to try and govern Brittany , so it must be asked what stood in the way of preventing their rule , what were the limiting factors to Frankish control ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #6:1>
Even though the Franks did not rule Brittany they certainly aimed to do so and believed they had the right to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #7:1>
There is no doubt that they constantly claimed to rule Brittany after the migration period of circa fifth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #8:1>
According to the annales Mettlenses priores , in 753 pippin Pippin captured Vannes and subjected Brittany to Frankish rule .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #9:1>
However it is impossible that all of Brittany submitted to him after only the seizure of Vannes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #10:1>
And there is no sign that Pippin ever followed up on the success of his Breton expedition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #11:1>
Rather The seizure of vannes Vannes marks the prelude rather than the commencement of a century of Carolingian attempts to control Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #12:1>
In 799 under Charlemagne another Bretton Breton campaign was launched as a result of which the Breton leaders surrendered .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #13:1>
Despite this there were many revolts by the Bretons in the beginning of the ninth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #14:1>
Under Louis the Pious the unrest became more serious .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #15:1>
But Louis regarded Brittany as fully within his jurisdiction , and that his right to rule the Bretons rested not on conquest but on the status of Brittany as part of the Frankish kindom kingdom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #16:1>
Seen in this light the campaigns of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious had done no more than reassert rightful Frankish rule .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #17:1>
Charles the Bald devoted a considerable amount of time to trying to settle Brittany , but was less successful than his father &ampersand; Louis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #18:1>
Yet he did regard authority over Brittany as his .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #19:1>
Despite Frankish campaigns the Brettons Bretons attacked Frankish lands .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #20:1>
In the ninth century Brettonic military action in West Francia aimed at economic and political centres with the aim of conquest , not merely grape raiding as in pre-ninth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #21:1>
As a result Rennes and Nantes were conquered and became part of Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #22:1>
The relationship between Frankish and Bretton leaders was not a consistent one of open hostility .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #23:1>
Breton leaders received grants of territory and made alliances with the Franks against the viking Viking threat .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #24:1>
According to Frankish sources the terms of some of these grants imply dependence and even vasalage vassalage .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #25:1>
But it did not stop Breton leaders from attacking the Frankish empire when they found themselves in a position of strength .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #26:1>
At times the Breton leaders behaved like dependants of Frankish kings , but at others they pursued openly aggressive policies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #27:1>
Thus it would appear that acceptance of territory need not have implied service .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #28:1>
Though it did result in Frankish influence , the Principes gaining Frankish lands must have been accompanied by increased knowledge of Frankish administration procedures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #29:1>
The Franks found it hard to rule Brittany because they were not always in a strong enough position to assert their authority .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #30:1>
They were at times weakened by the revolts and intrigue of the Neustrian magnates , and also Viking raiding and attack .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #31:1>
The Bretons were not willing to accept Frankish control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #32:1>
Although That the Bretons paid tribute and accepted land grants does not constitute Frankish rule .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #33:1>
To what degree was there Frankish influence on the structures of government , and how far were they able to exercise their power within Brittany ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #34:1>
It was characteristic that the Franks should follow up military victory by attempting to extend Frankish customs and institutions into Brittany , as they had in other areas .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #35:1>
In South-East Brittany , Scabini - who were pannels panels of long-serving judgement finders at county courts - are mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #36:1>
However , there is no consistent use of the term ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #37:1>
all we can argue effectively is that Frankish terminology was in established use by the time of the earliest surviving Breton charter , in some areas .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #38:1>
However , Carolingian forms of government were indeed being extended into central and Western Brittany ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #39:1>
this is shown by the appearance of vicecomites .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #40:1>
This was not a revival of a pre-Carolingian rank , but an office established in line with Carolingian practices elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #41:1>
By the eleventh century the rights of these vicecomites was were extended .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #42:1>
Charlemagne was successful in his campaign against Brittany in 799 , but he still had to secure control of the peninsula after this date .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #43:1>
The imposition of oaths and tribute was a means to this effect , but if Frankish kings could encourage Bretton Breton primores to enter into close relationships with them , Frankish influence would be much greater .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #44:1>
In the Eastern part of Brittany at least , Charlemagne installed his own Frankish followers as counts as did Louis the Pious -
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #45:1>
nominee is likely to have been an imperial appointee .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #46:1>
But this arrangement did not continue under Charles the Bald .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #47:1>
On occasion Frankish rulers intervened directly in Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #48:1>
For example they issued diplomas for Breton monasteries , which conveyed to these Breton communities the same legal status and privileges as many Frankish churches enjoyed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #49:1>
Consequently benefits such as lodgings , loyalty and tax were denied to Breton rulers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #50:1>
Frankish emperors were able at times to curb Brittany in a military sense , and did influence it in part .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #51:1>
Yet this does not constitute Frankish rule .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #52:1>
After 799 the Franks had the potential to rule Brittany through the &lsquo; Frankization &rsquo; of government structure .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #53:1>
But this potential was not realised , because of the structure of the local communities of Brittany and the position of the Breton principes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #54:1>
The plebes plebs by the ninth century was a &ldquo; group of people together with the area inhabited by them , forming both a Christian community and the only secular unit of government and jurisdiction smaller than a county &rdquo; -
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #55:1>
Smith .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #56:1>
The state was not involved with authority within the plebes plebs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #57:1>
The most prominent person being was the machtiern .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #58:1>
He was an important landowner , a man of high status who also exercised particular judicial functions within the plebs under his control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #59:1>
It was generally a hereditary position and the machtiern was an independent authority not a public official .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #60:1>
Yet his power was not solely exercised for his privite private benefit ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #61:1>
he had public responsibility .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #62:1>
For example he presided over transactions involving the transfer of property rights and might be approached to find a solution to village problems .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #63:1>
The plebes plebs organised their own dispute settlements &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #64:1>
these were generally settled locally without recourse to political leaders .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #65:1>
There was a desire to settle amicably and even in formal court proceedings a compromise solution was often reached .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #66:1>
Decisions were formed through knowledge of local matters .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #67:1>
And the enforcement of decisions was achieved by sureties which had a policing and punishing function .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #68:1>
The village communities were more or less self-governing and the machtiern was not an official of the state .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #69:1>
Therefore the Franks were devoid of methods and institutions through which to assert their control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #70:1>
There was no machinery to institute political control , and the effectiveness of &lsquo; public authority &rsquo; was too often dependent upon &lsquo; private power &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #71:1>
In order to establish a form of Frankish control in Brittany , Louis the Pious appointed nomeniae in 831 as sole ruler in his name , as missus imperatoriis in Brittania .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #72:1>
It was Frankish attack and then the needs of Frankish government that stimulated the political unity of Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #73:1>
The ninth century saw the emergence of single rulers who had the responsibility for the whole of Brittany in defence and negotiation terms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #74:1>
But one should consider the scope of the power of the Breton principes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #75:1>
They claimed authority over all Brittany but how effective was this claim ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #76:1>
It is clear that the authority of the principes was resented and challenged ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #77:1>
there was conspiracy and conflict throughout the reigns .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #78:1>
The main limitation on the power of the Breton principes was the influence of the machtierns , whom they were not able to compel .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #79:1>
Another constraint on them must have been the lack of landed resources and steady revenues accruing to him them as Principes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #80:1>
Frankish rule could not be aided by manipulation of the Principes Princeps , as he wasn't in a position to assert his authority over the lower levels of society , despite the fact he was successful in his role of military leader and negotiator .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #81:1>
It is true that the Franks did influence Brittany , but the consequent changes in Breton government , and the exercise of authority at either imperial or principes level had little effect on the organisation of local communities and their self-regulation of their affairs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #82:1>
This is because there was no adequate hierarchy of authority existed to enable those who claimed the greatest power over Brittany to penetrate and influence the everyday life of those subjects at the lower levels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #83:1>
For the local communities Frankish conquest and the distant rule of the Carolingians brought little major change during the period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #84:1>
The changes brought about by Frankish influence occurred instead mostly within the upper levels of Breton Society - the Principes and their immediate followers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #85:1>
The official channels of authority do not compare with the plebes plebs and machtiern , which was where the actual location of power was .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #86:1>
Thus the Franks had very little influence on the ways power was exercised within Brittany .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #87:1>
However , Frankish attempts at domination of the Peninsula did leave its mark .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #88:1>
At the very least , the terminology of legal records and landholding agreements changed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #89:1>
There was an expansion of princely auth<l>ority in terms of Carolingian powers in monastic privileges .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #90:1>
A gradual spread of ecclesiastical demands by the mid tenth century for the payment of tithes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #91:1>
A spread of feudal tenures and also the appointment of counts , viscounts and missi to carry princely power into the localities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #92:1>
Frankish stimulus resulted in a move away from a society of more or less independent rural communities each with a machtiern to a society dominated by aristocratic warbands .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #93:1>
The viking invasions and temporary takeover didn't put an end to development , but did serve to weaken both machtiern and principes power .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #94:1>
If one takes the nature of rule to mean govern and control then the Franks did not rule Brittany , though they were responsible for the formation of Brittany into a political unit .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #95:1>
This failure to rule was due to a lack of institutions that which could be used to effect practical control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #X96:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #97:2>
One must begin with examining what is meant by the end before attempting to date this event .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #98:2>
What constitutes the end of Roman Britain ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #99:2>
Is it the decline and removal of Imperial military power , the withdrawal of Roman central authority , the usurpation of Roman rule , or perhaps all of these ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #100:2>
Rome influenced Britain in military , Civil , social , economic and religious matters .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #101:2>
Thus it would be fair to say that the end of Roman Britain would be when these influences were withdrawn and rejected .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #102:2>
Yet , no one date can be put forward when this occured occurred .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #103:2>
The end of Roman Britain was a gradual , hazy and slow process .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #104:2>
Inspite of In spite of the classic &lsquo; end &rsquo; dates there was continuation in many aspects of Imperial rule .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #105:2>
The end of Roman Britain is subjective &semi; Byzantium , the West Roman empire and Britain differ as to when Roman Britain terminated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #106:2>
Good quality contemporary , or near contemporary , written sources concerning the period of transition from the Britain of Roman occupation to the independent Anglo-Saxon and Brittonic kingdoms are rare .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #107:2>
Gildas composed our prime text about 535 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #108:2>
But his narrative without dates and few names is unreliable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #109:2>
Yet his idea of how Germanic power in Britain began from the mutiny of mercenary forces is plausable plausible .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #110:2>
Gildas is of the view that the ruin of Britain began with the islands island 's throwing up of usurpers , among whose rebellions that of magnus maximus Magnus Maximus was the most significant and dangerous to Britains Britain 's security .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #111:2>
In 383 maximus Maximus left for Gaul , taking with him Britain 's best soldiery , never to return , in order to seize the imperial throne .
<ICE-GB:W1A-003 #112:2>
The consequent weakening of British defence led to a series of disasters , in which Rome failed to successfuly intervene in .

Introduction
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #6:1>
During the second term of her first year of undergraduate mathematics , my fiance fianc&eacute;e was hit by a rather foolish young car driver whilst cycling home from college .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #7:1>
Fortunately she was not seriously injured .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #8:1>
However , she does not recall the few minutes before the accident .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #9:1>
Those few minutes of her life , of which she was then conscious , are lost to her memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #10:1>
This is ( I am pleased to say ) a very minor form of retrograde amnesia , yet it still leaves a certain fear in my fiance fianc&eacute;e at times when she attempts to recall those lost events .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #11:1>
Amnesia , in whatever form , is a particularly pernicious psychological deficit .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #12:1>
From minor memory loss to the loss of personal identity , amnesia expresses itself in brain damage as the result of closed or open head injuries , and in cases of diseases like dementia or viral encephalitis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #13:1>
When psychologists attempt to categorise amnesia they may choose to classify the amnesia according to the cause ( disease or damaged brain locality ) or the effect ( functional deficit of memory ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #14:1>
Research into the common localities of brain damage in amnesic patients has shown that the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , hippocampus and mamillary bodies are strongly related to memory functioning ( Baddeley , 1990 &semi; Levin , Grafman &ampersand; Eisenberg , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #15:1>
Damage from closed head injuries can be incurred in a variety of ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #16:1>
Firstly , the head may twist sharply , tearing and twisting the connections and membranes of the brain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #17:1>
General large lesions may occur due to the impact of the blow upon the skull being imparted to the brain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #18:1>
Finally , bony protuberances in the skull may rip into the tissue of the brain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #19:1>
Such protuberances are common in the skull regions adjacent to the temporal lobes mentioned above as important for memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #20:1>
Three classes of amnesia may result from such closed head injuries &semi; post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) , retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #21:1>
The following sections describe these types of deficit .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #22:1>
Post-Traumatic Amnesia ( PTA )
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #23:1>
After recovering from unconsciousness many blunt trauma victims ( e.g. a boxer after a bad knock out punch ) suffer a period of incoherent mental functioning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #24:1>
This is usually characterised by confusion about one 's present location , amnesia for new material which can be quite dense and short periods of near normal functioning ( called islands of lucidity ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #25:1>
More recently psychologists have been interested in examining the length of time in PTA as a predictor of the intensity of amnesia after the PTA has diminished ( Baddeley , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #26:1>
Retrograde Amnesia
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #27:1>
As the case of my fiance fianc&eacute;e indicates , this type of amnesia is noted by the loss of recall for events that took place before the amnesia producing event .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #28:1>
Whilst my fiance fianc&eacute;e seems to have been quite lucky others are not so .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #29:1>
For example the following is a report of a man who was thrown from his motorcycle ( reported in Russell , 1959 , pp. 69-70 ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #X30:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #X31:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #32:1>
A week after the incident , &ldquo; When questioned .... he said that the date was February 1922 , and that he was a schoolboy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #X33:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #34:1>
But two weeks after the injury , &ldquo; .... he remembered the five years spent in Australia , and remembered returning to this country &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #35:1>
the past two years were a complete blank . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #36:1>
After three weeks , &ldquo; he returned to the village where he had been working for two years .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #X37:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #38:1>
Finally , 10 weeks after the accident , &ldquo; ... the events of the past two years were gradually recollected and finally he was able to remember everything up to within a few minutes . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #39:1>
Such shrinkage in the extent of the amnesia over time is interesting in that it suggests that it is the retrieval , rather than the storage or encoding , that is damaged .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #40:1>
It is also the case that the most recent memories are the least likely to return to consciousness following closed head injury .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #41:1>
The fact that both my fiance fianc&eacute;e , the young man in the example just presented and most other retrograde cases never ever regain memory for the last few minutes before the accident suggest suggests a more permanent loss of those memories concordant with the disruption of encoding and consolidation of those specific memory traces .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #42:1>
In fact a study of American football players ( Yarnell and Lynch , 1970 ) supported the view that such losses are the result of disrupted consolidation of the most recent traces .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #43:1>
In their study Yarnell and Lynch examined the responses of concussed players just after they had been &ldquo; dinged &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #44:1>
As they were led off the pitch the footballers were still able to recall the name of the play in which they had been injured .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #45:1>
However , a few minutes later when asked to recall the play they were quite unable to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #46:1>
The memory had obviously been in their heads ( i.e. been encoded ) but had failed to remain there ( i.e. had not been consolidated ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #47:1>
Some theorists think that in such cases the problem is one of retrieval not consolidation ( Miller and Springer , 1974 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #48:1>
However , the evidence is quite equivocal in this respect .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #49:1>
Furthermore , whilst shrinkage is quite common it is not always present in a clear cut way .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #50:1>
Some patients continue to have quite patchy autobiographical memories , which may be quite dense if the brain is extensively damaged ( Baddeley and Wilson , 1986 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #51:1>
Anterograde Amnesia
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #52:1>
This disorder manifests itself , in perhaps the most debilitating manner , as the inability to learn new material .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #53:1>
Retrograde amnesia may also be present but such cases are not common .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #54:1>
Usually the anterograde sufferer is quite able to remember events that occurred before the traumatic event ( trauma in the medical sense ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #55:1>
Any type of learning may be affected .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #56:1>
Particular learning deficits in the verbal and visuo-spatial domains have been identified with damage to the left and right hemispheres respectively ( Milner , 1971 &semi; Faglioni and Spinner , 1972 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #57:1>
I have now discussed the main types of amnesic disorder associated primarily , but not exclusively , with closed head injuries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #58:1>
Now I wish to discuss a particularly pure form of amnesia which has none of the non-memory related disorders common to other forms of amnesia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #59:1>
This form of amnesia is known as amnesia syndrome .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #60:1>
Amnesia Syndrome
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #61:1>
Amnesia is usually accompanied by other deficits of perception , language and attention ( Baddeley , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #62:1>
However , there are cases of amnesia where no other ( apparent ) deficit is observed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #63:1>
Such cases of pure memory deficit come under the term amnesic syndrome .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #64:1>
The syndrome has no one single cause &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #65:1>
Korsakoff 's syndrome , cerebral anoxia and viral encephalitis have all had clear associations to pure memory loss .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #66:1>
Furthermore , and more importantly , amnesic syndrome does have a clear association with damage to the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , hippocampus and mamillary bodies ( Baddeley , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #67:1>
In terms of the functional deficits exhibited in amnesic syndrome it appears that whilst working , autobiographical and semantic memories are usually little affected , the episodic component of long term memory is most frequently and obviously afflicted .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #68:1>
Thus patients patients ' ability to form new episodically based memories is severely depleted .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #69:1>
Learning new faces , information and environments is considerably retarded as a result .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #70:1>
Nevertheless , patients may have problems with the subtler aspects of other memory systems ( e.g. sentence verification speeds are increased on tasks relating to Collins and Quillian 's ( 1969 ) semantic networks for semantic memory whilst gross measures of verbal intelligence show normal scoring ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #71:1>
Of late , there has been research to indicate that procedural learning is retained in a great many contexts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #72:1>
Thus , for example , Baddeley and Wilson ( 1988 ) observed normal procedural learning on the pursuit rotor , reading revised scripts and certain puzzles and problems ( with their own patient , K. J. ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #73:1>
Such tasks appear to be common in that they do not require the subject to be aware of the learned information .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #74:1>
Funnily enough , many patients who show such learning consequently deny ever having done the task before !
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #75:1>
( Baddeley , 1982 &semi; Parkin , 1982 ; and Schacter Schachter , 1987 all provide reviews of this material ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #76:1>
As a result of this research , as Baddeley ( 1990 ) notes , &ldquo; ... the analysis of procedural learning is probably one of the liveliest areas of research in long term memory at present . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #77:1>
The research has gone so far as to force theorists ( e.g. Tulving , 1985 ) to infer a fractioning of memory into semantic-episodic components with a further procedural component .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #78:1>
Nevertheless , it is from the data about amnesia to the proposed theories of amnesia that the discussion now turns .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #79:1>
For purposes of length and expediency I shall devote the discussion to the most successful theories to date , glossing over the theories that are now discredited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #80:1>
Theories of the Amnesic Syndrome
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #81:1>
Theories of amnesia have not been short in supply .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #82:1>
But the number of theories that have stood the slings and arrows of empirical scrutiny , lamentably few , is a testimony to the difficulty of the cognitive enterprise .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #83:1>
Early fallers were the Input theories ( Cermak and Moreines , 1976 , being typical ) which stressed the possibility that amnesics might not spontaneously encode information at a deep semantic level , and the &lsquo; faster forgetting &rsquo; theory ( Squire , 1982 ) which argued that amnesics just forgot more rapidly than others .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #84:1>
The theory that interference from competing memory bits was affecting memory at the retrieval stage was proposed by Weiskrantz ( 1970 ) and rejected by Warrington and Weiskrantz ( 1978 ) after experiments showed that amnesics suffered no more interference effects than control subjects .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #85:1>
Suggestive , but not compelling , support has been produced for a fourth possibility &semi; that amnesia is a product of the inability to associate new material with the contextual cues necessary for later retrieval .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #86:1>
Winocur and Mills ( 1970 ) and Huppert and Piercy ( 1978 ) have conducted experiments to assess this theory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #87:1>
In the Huppert and Piercy ( 1978 ) experiment subjects were required to make judgments about the frequency and recency with which they had seen two groups of pictures presented ( each group separately ) on two consecutive days .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #88:1>
Amnesic subjects did not perform as well as the controls but it is the quality of the decrement that is interesting .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #89:1>
Control subjects seemed to associate the pictures remembered with the environment in which they were first seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #90:1>
Amnesics seemed to be correct more often if they were recollecting more frequently presented pictures , suggesting a general dependence of memory on trace strength rather then than situational context .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #91:1>
However , this result is the only one not explicable in terms of an alternative interpretation &semi; hence , it provides the only clear , unequivocal evidence for the contextual theory of amnesia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #92:1>
So whilst the contextual theory remains popular it is somewhat less than compelling given the current state of the data in it 's its favour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #93:1>
Awaiting Memory 's Marr
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #94:1>
Perhaps the most promising view is that which suggests that amnesia is the result of damage to a specific systemic component of episodic memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #95:1>
This stems from the knowledge that episodic memory stores the products of cognitive links formed from previously separate components of memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #96:1>
An inability to form new conscious links between experiences is precisely what amnesic patients find so hard .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #97:1>
Such knowledge organisation is separate from other forms such as procedural learning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #98:1>
As Weiskrantz ( 1982 ) makes clear , as associative pairings involve more remote components , so it becomes more difficult for amnesic patients to learn the new association .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #99:1>
So amnesia is to be seen as an inability to organise old episodically stored components into new cognitive groupings on the basis of new episodically relevant information .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #100:1>
The newest interpretation of amnesic syndrome has arisen as a result of the failure of previous theories and the increased prominence of procedural learning research .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #101:1>
If the new ideas do provide empirically successful studies it still remains to be asked why such brain damage ( to any one or more of several components ) leads to such a specific effect ( Baddeley , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #102:1>
Baddeley suggests that what is needed is a clearer mapping of our information processing theory ( of episodic systems deficit ) on to our knowledge of the physiologically relevant mechanisms ( as have been only cursorily identified in the amnesic syndrome ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-004 #103:1>
Whilst such a mammoth task has been forthcoming in the field of vision ( a fine example of the power of cognitive science , no less than Marr 's contribution ) it appears to be the case that , for the time being , the field of memory still awaits the arrival of its &lsquo; Marr &rsquo; .

Design and Implementation
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #3:1>
The work that went into designing and implementing a system to match the requirements specified above is detailed in the following sections .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #4:1>
I worked on the three areas of the project sequentially , the order of the description broadly reflecting the order in which I approached the work of the project .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #5:1>
More specific implementation details are given at the end of the report .

Corpus Definition
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #8:1>
3.5.1
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #9:1>
Storing the corpus parameter structure
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #10:1>
The aim of the Corpus Definition sub-system is to enable the definition of a corpus structure to be entered by the program 's user .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #11:1>
The structure is stored for later use in defining text parameters , and for selecting sub-corpora by parameter groups .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #12:1>
3.5.1.1
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #13:1>
Describing the Corpus Parameter Tree
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #14:1>
As I described above , the corpus parameters are related in a hierarchical structure , each parameter group splitting into further sub-groups in a tree-like manner .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #15:1>
In the SEU 's parameter trees there are no loops between parameters , and it is equally unlikely that there would be loops in a similar parameter tree describing another corpus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #16:1>
However , in the original description of the problem it was stated that there would be a requirement for some common entries in the parameter tree ( ie some &ldquo; fan-in &rdquo; ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #17:1>
This turned out not to be the case , the ambiguity having arisen due to the description of the corpus parameters in terms of four main trees ( the fifth being the text data tree ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #18:1>
I suggested that in fact the five trees could be combined into a single one by combining the root entries of each into a single higher-level selection -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #19:1>
this seemed a more versatile system to use , as it made simpler the task of handling the parameters ( one tree instead of five ) and didn't have the drawback of imposing the SEU 's parameter structure on other users .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #20:1>
Each text will have a describing parameter in each original tree .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #21:1>
As each original tree can be thought of as having single text names as its terminal nodes , in a single unified tree made up of the five joined parameter trees with a common root , several parameters will have texts in common .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #22:1>
This results in the &ldquo; fan-in &rdquo; effect .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #23:1>
In fact , this last level of the tree is not necessary in order to store the text data -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #24:1>
as described above each text can be fully described by the set of parameters which apply to it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #25:1>
3.5.1.2
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #26:1>
Options for Interactively Defining the Parameter Tree -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #27:1>
As a major requirement was that the corpus structure be user-definable , and therefore usable with different corpora , some system had to be devised by which the structure could be displayed and altered interactively on-screen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #28:1>
I chose this approach almost immediately , rather than opting for a command-line driven system , as the system was to be used by staff who were unfamiliar with , and disliked , the use of command-line style interfaces to run programs and to use DOS .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #29:1>
Ease of use and an attractive user interface were requested as high priorities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #30:1>
The two main approaches I considered to displaying the corpus structure on-screen were those that I had seen before , being : &bullet; Drawing a graphical tree structure on-screen ( typically used to display the directory tree in file-handling programs , and in my 2nd year group project ) , and &bullet; Displaying the tree structure in terms of a hierarchical menu system , with each menu representing a node on the tree .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #31:1>
After consideration I chose the second option of a menu system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #32:1>
My reasons were the relative simplicity of displaying a menu system , the possibility of using an off-the-shelf package to do this for me , and an active request for some kind of windowing interface ( of which menus were a familiar feature ) from the Survey staff .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #33:1>
3.5.1.3
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #34:1>
Choosing a Menu System -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #35:1>
I spent some time looking for a suitable menu package to use to do this , but could not find a wholly suitable system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #36:1>
The main features of the packages I considered were :
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #37:1>
&bullet; Most available menu packages are designed as a user interface to DOS commands rather than for use within programs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #38:1>
Many are memory-resident .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #39:1>
&bullet; The Survey had a package called Designer Pop-Up Menus which allowed user-definable menus , but these had to be defined in advance of use and compiled using a special language .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #40:1>
This ruled out any interactive menu definition and so was not suitable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #41:1>
&bullet; Zortech , makers of the C++ compiler I was using , sold a windowing library for use within programs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #42:1>
However , after reading the sales literature the package did not seem to offer much more of use than C-WIN (
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #43:1>
see below ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #44:1>
&bullet; By chance I found a package called C-WIN on the public-domain bulletin boards .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #45:1>
This was the source code for a &lsquo; C &rsquo; windowing library offering basic windowing , but without explicit functions for implementing menus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #46:1>
My eventual decision was to use the C-WIN package and to implement a menu system based around it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #47:1>
The package itself was written in Microsoft C code and had to be altered slightly to compile under Zortech C++ .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #48:1>
The alterations that I made to the package are described in Appendix B .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #49:1>
The general requirement of the menu system , and one that made it slightly more complex than those which were commercially available , was for a menu with a variable ( possibly very large ) number of entries , which could be updated interactively by the user .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #50:1>
To implement this I considered three main classes of solution :
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #51:1>
&bullet; An entry list stored in an array .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #52:1>
&bullet; A linked list of menu entries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #53:1>
&bullet; An array which could be re-sized as required .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #54:1>
I rejected the two array options , the first fixed size array because of its inflexibility in dealing with an unknown number of entries , and the last because of its complexity , requiring the copying of one array into a new larger or smaller one as the number of entries in a menu changed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #55:1>
This left the linked list of menu entries , which I chose as being the most intuitive solution for the variable list length required , and for the relatively simple way in which entries could be added and deleted as required without wasting or running out of storage .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #56:1>
Using a doubly linked list enables easy traversal up and down the entry list as required .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #57:1>
The entry corresponds to the branches on a tree , and is contained within a menu object structure which corresponds to the intermediate nodes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #58:1>
The entries point to two types of structure on the corpus tree - terminating &lsquo; leaf &rsquo; nodes √´ leaf √≠ nodes which carry the actual text parameters , and selection nodes which are simply further sub-menus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #59:1>
Initially I designed a structure to allow for common entries which comprised an additional structure between the menu and menu entry objects , enabling an entry to be shared between several parent menus ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #60:1>
but as explained above the structure was not used
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #61:1>
and therefore a simpler one was employed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #62:1>
3.5.1.4
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #63:1>
Displaying Menus -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #64:1>
One of the first problems I encountered with the menu system was in the display , and how to display a menu with a variable number of entries in a window of fixed size .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #65:1>
C-WIN does not support the re-sizing of windows , and even if it had there may be situations in which the number of entries exceeds the screen size and so can't be shown at the same time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #66:1>
The solution was to regard the window as a window onto a ( possibly larger ) list of entries , and to allow scrolling of the entry list in the window .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #67:1>
This was implemented using two additional pointers in the menu object , which point to the &lsquo; first shown &rsquo; and &lsquo; last shown &rsquo; entries in the entry list , and display only the entries between these two pointers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #68:1>
3.5.1.5
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #69:1>
Menu Data Structures -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #70:1>
A further decision made at this point was for the menu entry to hold the name of each selection , rather than the actual menu or parameter nodes pointed to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #71:1>
This enabled the leaf parameter nodes to be smaller , and the name of the selection to be retrieved easily when the entry was displayed in the menu on-screen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #72:1>
The name of the whole corpus tree ( ie the root entry ) has then to be stored outside the structure , but is used in other contexts as the corpus name .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #73:1>
As mentioned above , each entry holds a pointer to either a leaf node or a further menu object , and a flag to indicate the type of structure pointed to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #74:1>
Each leaf node object contains a record of the parameter type ( flag , number , or string ) of the leaf , and the value of the actual parameter .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #75:1>
To enable backtracking up the menu structure , each menu object contains a pointer back up to its parent menu .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #76:1>
One menu entry is always considered to be current , and a further pointer to the current entry in the entry list is maintained in the menu object structure .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #77:1>
The entry is highlighted for reference when displayed , and is altered by the user of the system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #78:1>
A further flag is held in each menu object to indicate the selection type by which parameters beneath the menu can be selected to apply to individual texts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #79:1>
As described above , these enforce the mutual exclusion of parameters for each text , and indicate whether selections are &ldquo; one-of &rdquo; or √¨ one-or-more-of &rdquo; the parameters beneath .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #80:1>
These are defined when setting up the corpus description .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #81:1>
3.5.2
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #82:1>
Adding Entries
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #83:1>
Adding a new menu entry splits into two different problems , according to the type of entry to be added : &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #84:1>
adding a new leaf parameter node , and &bullet; adding a new sub-menu .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #85:1>
In either case a new menu entry object is added to the linked list of entries ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #86:1>
and then the relevant leaf object or menu object is created and pointed to as required by the menu entry .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #87:1>
3.5.2.1
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #88:1>
Adding to the Menu Entry List -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #89:1>
The addition of an entry to the linked list of entries is a straightforward process of joining pointers , but is complicated severely by the need to update the first shown entry , last shown entry and current entry pointers as well .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #90:1>
There are several distinct special case conditions involving these pointers , such as adding an entry after the last shown or before the first shown , when the menu display needs to be recalculated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #91:1>
My solution was to add a new entry to the list in a default position immediately after the current entry (
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #92:1>
if the list was empty , current would be a null pointer
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #93:1>
and the new entry would become the first entry in the list ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #94:1>
The pointers are then recalculated
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #95:1>
and the newly added entry made the new current entry .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #96:1>
This made logical sense to a user of the system , who would want to be able to place a new entry and then to manipulate it ( eg to give the entry a name ) as the new current entry .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #97:1>
To simplify the pointer calculations , the calculation of the last shown entry pointer is left out of the process of adding the entry , and updated as part of the menu display function where it can be calculated from the first shown entry and known window size .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #98:1>
3.5.2.2
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #99:1>
Options and Improvements -
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #100:1>
The first implementation of the system allowed the user to add a new entry only after the current menu entry ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #101:1>
but this had the drawback of not allowing a new entry to be added at the head of the entry list ( unless the list had been previously empty ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #102:1>
To make the system more flexible a new function was written at the request of the survey , which enabled the addition of an entry before the current one as well .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #103:1>
This made the adding of entries easier to use rather than adding any great functionality to the system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #104:1>
Rather than writing an entirely separate &lsquo; insert before current entry &rsquo; function this was implemented by adding a new entry after the current one using the existing function , and then swapping the new entry with its previous one and making the previous entry the new current .
<ICE-GB:W1A-005 #105:1>
Moving the sub-structure between entries is simply a matter of moving the pointer from one entry to the other without altering the existing sub-menu or leaf parameter objects .

<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #4:1>
The climatic fluctuations experienced during the Quaternary have followed a cyclic pattern , and has have therefore attracted the development of several theories , suggesting different reasons for the regularity and frequency of such climatic fluctuations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #5:1>
The glacial cycle describes a cold phase normally associated with an ice age , and an interglacial cycle is the time period often between two glacial stages .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #6:1>
During these stages there is an amelioration of climate with temperature , in the temporate temperate zone , causing the levels to rise to those being experienced today .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #7:1>
One of the first scientists to develop a theory to explain the glacial/interglacial cycles was Louis Agassiz .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #8:1>
He used his experience from a journey to Jura to explain the masses of glacial ice movement which covered Europe and North America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #9:1>
His theory suggested that the ice sheet developed before the Alps were formed , and hence &lsquo; slid &rsquo; down to the Jura as the land uplifted .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #10:1>
His evidence for this ice movement was in the local geology which consisted of erratic boulders and polished rocks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #11:1>
Agassiz ' Theory was very influential during this era and many scientists altered their views ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #12:1>
these included Buckland , Lyell and members of the Geological Society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #13:1>
His theory remained the dominant view until 1875 when J. Croll dev<l>eloped his theory on climatic variations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #14:1>
( Embleton 1975 )
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #15:1>
Calculated temperature variations were too small , which were likely to be no more than 1 &degree; or 2 &degree;C , to account for such large climatic changes in the Pleistocene .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #16:1>
Also , the geometrical properties of the Earth 's motion , around the sun , must have been established before the Pleistocene , so why were there no ice ages during the earlier epochs of the Cenozoic period ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #17:1>
The reason for this may be because the astronomical variation was only a contributing factor , and may have only determined the timing of ice ages in relation to , for example , the uplift in the land .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #18:1>
The recent re-establishment of Milankovitch 's Theory is due to an : - &ldquo; appreciation of the regularity and periodicity of Quaternary climatic change which has arisen from work on sea level variations particularly from the continuous oxygen isotrope traces from deep-ocean sediments &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #19:1>
( Imbrie 1979 )
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #20:1>
An improvement of dating techniques such as ice core samples , have identified the Milankovitch cycles , as well as other higher frequency climatic fluctuations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #21:1>
Hays et al ( 1976 ) used the dating of oxygen isotope changes in foraminiferal tests from deep ocean cores to establish and match the cyclic changes with the insolation changes at 65&degree; N .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #22:1>
It is debatable that there is a direct relationship between orbital cycles and climatic changes because of the maximum difference in the total insolation received over the last million years , this being &smaller-than; √£ 0.6% .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #23:1>
Until 1970 , the Milankovitch Theory was still partly controversial , due mainly to the fact that there were incomplete and poorly dated geological records .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #24:1>
In addition , the theory was based on insolation curves which represte represented a limited range of latitudes and seasons , and caused a degree of concern over their accuracy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #25:1>
A recent study in and around the Great Barrier Reef by Ian Anderson used core samples from the marine environment , which discovered not only that the Great Barrier Reef was younger than was originally thought , but it's its develop<l>ment coincided with the cycles suggested by Milankovitch .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #26:1>
Evidence for this was in the fluctuating sea level which was caused by the periodic changes in the rotation of the Earth , which in turn had affected the climate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #27:1>
The reason why the Milankovitch Theory is currently favoured as an explanation of glacial and interglacial cycles is because no-one has really challenged it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #28:1>
The cause of ice ages is still a controversial subject , and debates continue about the precise climatic effects of individual cycles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #29:1>
The main problem with the Milankovitch Theory is that small radiation changes was were seen as the entire cause of the large climatic fluctuations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #30:1>
It has now been established that these radiation changes are not the main cause but are effected by strong feedbacks in carbon dioxide , water vapour , sea ice , large-scale ocean circulation and albedo .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #31:1>
As these different factors are assessed , most acceptable theories are founded on a combination of land-mass altitude and short-term solar radiation changes which are a result in varying geometrical relationships of the Earth and sun .

<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #46:2>
Statistical data can be portrayed in many different ways - as just lists of figures , or diagrams or if a spatial element is involved as a map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #47:2>
Portraying statis<l>tics in the form of a map can have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of visual effect , accurate presentation of data , and also use of the map - ie. data retrieval/interpretation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #48:2>
Choropleth mapping is only one part of a whole series of maps which can be used to present and interpret data .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #49:2>
These other forms include dot mapping , proportion circle mapping , pie-chart mapping , block-chart mapping .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #50:2>
These forms use symbols over certain points - e.g. cities to represent the statistical values of that point/area .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #51:2>
Possibly one of the best known variety of statistical mapping is isoline mapping ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #52:2>
this form uses lines of different values to represent changing values ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #53:2>
those isolines are seen as contour lines on maps of earth shape , isobar lines to show air pressure and many other variations showing a variety of statistics .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #54:2>
As can be seen there are many forms of mapping to choose from in order to portray statistics .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #55:2>
Therefore the problems of interpretation and presentation of choropleth mapping play a significant part in the &lsquo; pros &rsquo; and &lsquo; cons &rsquo; of using it as a method -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #56:2>
the geographer/statistician must decide which form of portrayal would best suit their particular needs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #57:2>
G C Dickinson gives 4 reasons for drawing statistical maps : &lsquo; one - To arouse greater interest in the subject matter present , two - to clarify it , simplify it or explain its more important aspects , three - to prove a point referred to in text or speech , four - to act as a statistical &lsquo; quarry &rsquo; for other users &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #58:2>
These therefore must be the reasons behind choropleth mapping , otherwise it would not be as widely used .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #59:2>
Choropleth mapping basically involved the shading/colouring of areas of map in order to portray the statistical values in relation to other areas on the map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #60:2>
The map must be divided into specific areas which can then be classified according to values .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #61:2>
Therefore the data may be divided into specific groups which are allocated to a particular colour or shading .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #62:2>
An effective way of using this is to give smaller/lower values a lighter shading/colour with high values have having darker shading/colour - so that the visual effect is more easily understandable
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #63:2>
the density of shading is roughly proportional to the quantities being <unclear-word> -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #64:2>
a progression can be seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #65:2>
Choropleth can be implemented not only inside specific spatial areas , but also within isoline maps - showing density for example ( of population )
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #66:2>
in this way progression of values can be seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #67:2>
David M. Smith also identifies quadrant choropleth mapping - in which only specific quadrants within the map are shaded - according to their significance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #68:2>
Choropleth mapping is effective in the way it presents the information with a good visual format .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #69:2>
Using shading/colouring properly provides &lsquo; at a glance &rsquo; information -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #70:2>
the map shows areas of high/low proportion etc without having to read figures , percentages , proportions etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #71:2>
Also information can be retrieved - within the boundaries of the classification of the data .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #72:2>
Davis &ampersand; McCullogh also see Choropleth mapping as useful because it can be easily drawn - on a Line Printer .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #73:2>
This ease of drawing however also applied to hand drawing -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #74:2>
certainly a choropleth map provides a very simple , easy way of portraying information .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #75:2>
However , having explained fully the uses and background of choropleth mapping the problems of presentation and interpretation must be examined .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #76:2>
Firstly at the very beginning of the process of making a choropleth map the problem of deciding the number of classes and their intervals can become serious .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #77:2>
For instance a choice of wrong intervals alters a map considerably .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #78:2>
This can be seen in Figure 16 G C Dickinson - Second Edition ( -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #79:2>
although this diagram aims to show what varying boundaries can do , it shows effectively the way slight variation can totally alter the appearance of a map ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #80:2>
G C Dickinson recommends that class differences should partly be defined by shading - ie the degrees of shading available .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #X81:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #82:2>
( G C Dickinson ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #83:2>
This however is alright if the right equipment is available , but very difficult to do free-hand ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #84:2>
also it has been proved that shading increased mechanically/mathematically does not necessarily have the desired effect of increase on the eye .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #85:2>
The next major problem of choropleth mapping is the fact that the shading must be confined within certain boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #86:2>
The first problem with this is that it sets a specific line for change between two classes on the map , when in reality most changes occur very gradually over a large area .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #87:2>
This therefore tends to generalise too much on the map - only identifying wider scale increases and decreases .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #88:2>
G C Dickinson identifies this problem as the main disadvantage of choropleth mapping and quotes J. K. Wright ( &lsquo; A method of Mapping Densities of Population with Cape Cod as an Example &rsquo; Geographical Review vol. 26 New York 1986 ) in which an intelligent guess is made using the statistics in order to try to redesign class boundaries according to the line of transition as opposed to an area boundary set down before the choropleth values were identified .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #89:2>
David M Smith identifies a classic example of the border problems - in which a map from the Times 25 Sept. 1972 showing population within Europe makes no distinction in population density ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #90:2>
this therefore means that large countries are grouped together etc -
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #91:2>
the map identifies country size not population levels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #92:2>
One further disadvantage of choropleth mapping - related to the interpretation of the map is the fact that once classified , it is very hard to retrieve specific data from the map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #93:2>
To retrieve specific data , the original source must again be consulted - thereby defeating the purpose of a map - that is to make data portrayal and interpretation easier .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #94:2>
This is a considerable disadvantage for choropleth mapping - for having spent time converting data into categories/groups to be used with a chart , more time then has to be spent either converting back or consulting data just for say , one specific value .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #95:2>
Thus it can be seen that choropleth has its advantages - good visual impression , easy to construct ( in some ways ) easy interpretation ( also restricted ) which may make it suitable for certain purposes in statistical analysis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #96:2>
However choropleth has numerous problems both in presentation and interpretation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #97:2>
G C Dickinson describes &lsquo; the inflexible shading techniques show up poorly against the discontinuity made by dots , which effect rather less abrupt transitions &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #98:2>
Indeed inflexibility would seem to sum up choropleth mapping in a number of different ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #99:2>
This inflexibility would then push choropleth mapping aside when considering data presentation in many cases , in favour of proportion square/circle mapping , dot mapping , isoline maps etc &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #100:2>
also proportional shading techniques ( close to choropleth mapping ) can provide &lsquo; true to scale &rsquo; representations of data .
<ICE-GB:W1A-006 #101:2>
Choropleth mapping gives a positive message in data representation but tends towards inaccuracy .

In an attempt to evaluate the usefulness and validity of the medical model as a framework with which to conceptualize psychopathology , a number of fundamental issues concerning the existence and recognition of mental illness will be discussed , after first describing the medical model and comparing it with other alternative models .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #4:1>
INTRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #5:1>
The major criticisms will then be presented , and counter arguments considered .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #6:1>
The view that the medical model is alive and well despite the criticisms will be supported in this essay .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #7:1>
The medical model is one of many alternative models that have been put forward in an attempt to understand psychopathology , which can be described as the inability to behave in a socially appropriate way , such that the consequences of one 's behaviour are maladaptive for oneself or society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #8:1>
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING MODELS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #9:1>
The utility of any model of psychopathology can be judged by the degree to which it provides a base for theories about psychological disorders .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #10:1>
Because maladaptive behaviour is not well understood , in terms of its causes or cures , or even in terms of its categorization and existence , any theory which leads to predictions and scientific testing of hypotheses regarding these difficulties can be considered valuable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #11:1>
Any particular model can also be viewed in terms of its impact on how one sees others , and on whether feelings and behaviours are perceived as pathological or normal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #12:1>
Models thus serve as guides in selecting both the kind of therapy to be used for persons with emotional problems , and the source of treatment and/or intervention required .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #13:1>
Different models organize or classify abnormal behaviour in very different ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #14:1>
The most commonly used model of psychopathology is the medical model , as opposed to the dynamic , behavioural , phenomenological and ethical ones , for example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #15:1>
In the medical model pathological behaviours are viewed as symptoms of a disease or a process like a disease .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #16:1>
DESCRIPTION OF MEDICAL MODEL .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #17:1>
Hence the term &ldquo; mental illness &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #18:1>
One basic assumption of the medical model is that emotional problems , like physical diseases , can be placed into diagnostic categories that have implications for cause and treatment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #19:1>
The model can be sub-divided into the organic medical model or the psychogenic medical model .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #20:1>
Both divisions suggest that treatment be directed towards the cause underlying the disease rather than the symptoms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #21:1>
However they differ with respect to the explanation of causes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #22:1>
The organic model emphasises physical causes , whereas the psychogenic division of the model maintains that psychological factors can have independent deleterious effects on health , and therefore require interventions at the psychological rather than the physiological level .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #23:1>
Regardless of which stand is taken , and they are not necessarily exclusive , the basic premise behind the model remains the same &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #24:1>
and that is that problems , whether physical or mental have causes , and that causes , whether organic or psychological , require treatment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #25:1>
EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL MODEL
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #26:1>
Historically the use of the medical model is important .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #27:1>
During the C19th people who claimed they had no control over their inappropriate behaviour were seen as malingerers or fakers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #28:1>
They were either ignored or sent to prison .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #29:1>
In an effort at reform , some physicians claimed that these people should be thought of as &ldquo; sick in the mind &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #30:1>
Thus , people with emotional problems came to be defined as ill rather than as loafers , and they were transferred from prisons to hospitals .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #31:1>
ALTERNATIVE MODELS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #32:1>
Alternative models of psychopathology have been proposed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #33:1>
For example , the dynamic or psychoanalytic model pioneered by Freud , assumes that abnormal behaviour reflects a &ldquo; dynamic &rdquo; battle or conflict between parts or aspects of a persons person 's personality rather than any physical or organic deficiencies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #34:1>
Treatment involves therapeutic assistance in becoming aware of unconscious emotional conflicts &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #35:1>
and diagnosis is not considered important because such conflicts are not thought of as illnesses &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #36:1>
rather behaviour is seen as unique to the individual .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #37:1>
Similarly , the behavioural model does not support the illness or sick concept either , but assumes that a person 's observable actions determine whether he/she is normal or abnormal :
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #38:1>
one is abnormal if one acts abnormally .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #39:1>
According to the behavioural model , all behaviour is a product of learning about the environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #40:1>
Thus , abnormal behaviour can be changed into normal behaviour by retraining individuals and/or by changing their environment in certain ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #41:1>
Moving away from the stimulus-response view of causation of the behaviourists , the phenomenological model focuses on the internal reality of the conscious mind .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #42:1>
Feelings and intuitions are thought of as important causative components .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #43:1>
The existential model , which is one type of phenomenological model focuses on the need for each person to develop his/her own meaning for life , and to take responsibility for guiding personal growth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #44:1>
Existential anxiety is experienced when life seems meaningless .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #45:1>
Rather than assuming that a person 's behaviour is determined by past experiences , this model assumes that behaviour is determined by the choices the individual makes in life .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #46:1>
In an attack on the medical model Thomas Szasz ( 1961 ) suggested that having &ldquo; problems in living &rdquo; is the most appropriate way of looking at those who suffer from emotional problems .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #47:1>
He proposed that life is not essentially harmonious and satisfying but is filled with stresses one must cope with .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #48:1>
Individuals who need professional help are those who cannot handle these problems themselves .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #49:1>
Szasz proposes that the medical &ldquo; myth &rdquo; of abnormal behaviour allows people to avoid the moral responsibilities of their action .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #50:1>
In supporting the ethical model , he therefore assumes that individuals are responsible for their own behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #51:1>
The ethical and existential models are the only ones that assume that people are responsible for their abnormal behaviour , rather than attributing the behaviour to illness , unresolved childhood conflicts , reinforcement , or other governing factors .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #52:1>
This question of responsibility has far-reaching social implications , especially concerning illegal behaviour , but has not yet been adequately resolved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #53:1>
CRITICISMS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #54:1>
The medical model has been criticized and attacked from a number of angles , by both those within and outside the medical profession .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #55:1>
One of the most vicious attacks was forwarded by Thomas Szasz ( 1961 ) who argued in favour of discarding the concept of &ldquo; mental illness &rdquo; altogether , on the grounds that it could not be reliably defined or diagnosed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #56:1>
In his view the term &ldquo; mental illness &rdquo; is misleading and ambiguous , in that , it was originally used to describe the same behavioural phenomena it is now said to cause .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #57:1>
To illustrate the point , the following statements can be compared :
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #58:1>
&ldquo; x behaviour is mental illness &rdquo; and &ldquo; mental illness causes x behaviour . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #59:1>
The first statement endorses the original meaning of the term which appears synonymous with abnormality , while the second one relates to present usage which is synonymous with disease .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #60:1>
Szasz therefore argues that to use the term &ldquo; mental illness &rdquo; in a diseased context is illogical and manipulative , and has developed from circular reasoning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #61:1>
Furthermore he proposes that there are no factual reasons why mental phenomena should be linked to the concept of disease .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #62:1>
In his view organic brain lesions produce neurological symptoms , not psychological ones which he suggest suggests arise from problems of living .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #63:1>
It is interesting to note that in this context , the mind/body dichotomy is supported , because the possibility of interaction between mind ( representing mental phenomena ) and body ( representing physical phenomena ) , whether in a healthy or unhealthy state , is denied .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #64:1>
Regarding the issue of diagnosis , Szasz raises two major criticisms concerning the analogy between physical and mental disease , implicit in the medical model .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #65:1>
Firstly , he suggests that the diagnostic process is non-comparable , in that , physical illnesses are assessed objectively and mental illnesses are assessed subjectively .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #66:1>
The implication is that physical illnesses can be diagnosed more reliably than can mental illnesses .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #67:1>
A disturbing example of the inaccuracy of psychiatric diagnosis was provided by Rosenhan ( 1973 ) , when he and 7 colleagues were successful in getting themeselves themselves admitted to 12 mental hospitals for an average of 19 days .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #68:1>
They were all diagnosed as schizophrenic on the basis of reporting that they had heard voices saying &ldquo; empty &rdquo; , &ldquo; hollow &rdquo; and &ldquo; thud &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #69:1>
Even on discharge the diagnosis was not lifted ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #70:1>
they retained the label of &lsquo; schizophrenia in remission . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #71:1>
The second criticism concerning diagnosis , is based on the assumption that physical illness is culture free whereas mental illness is culture-bound .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #72:1>
For example , certain political and religious beliefs thought of as delusional in the Soviet Union are considered normal elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #73:1>
COUNTER ARGUMENTS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #74:1>
Since no-one has yet been able to establish that mental illness ( the concept of a diseased mind ) does or does not exist , the criticisms concerning its definition are valid in their own right , and can be considered merely as differences of opinion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #75:1>
But to criticise the medical model on other grounds is according to Ausubel ( 1961 ) untenable and fallacious for a number of reasons .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #76:1>
Evidence suggests that Szasz 's first criticism concerning diagnosis , is unsubstanciated unsubstantiated , in that the diagnosis of physical illness is not as clear cut and objective as he believes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #77:1>
Just as one uses a certain amount of subjectivity in deciding where to draw the line between sadness and depression in mental illness , for example , it is often just as difficult for physicians to decide when to treat certain physical ailments such as bradycardia , or hypertension for example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #78:1>
Furthermore , the argument concerning the unreliability of &ldquo; mental &rdquo; diagnosis , as highlighted by Rosenhan ( 1973 ) may merely illustrate the fact that the diagnosis of mental illness is at the present more difficult than the diagnosis of physical disease , because the tools used in assessment are perhaps less well refined , established and universally accepted .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #79:1>
Thus , it is feasible to criticise the diagnostic process , but not the underlying model on this basis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #80:1>
A model is not necessarily invalid just because there are practical difficulties in employing it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #81:1>
Indeed such difficulties might be seen as adventageous advantageous in the sense that they inspire further research .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #82:1>
As scientific involvement increases , knowledge increases and advancements are likely .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #83:1>
Surely this is one of the most important reasons for having a model in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #84:1>
In psychiatric diagnosis changes are continually taking place .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #85:1>
For example , the diagnostic and statistics manual ( DSM ) has been updated twice , once in 1968 , and again in 1980 , with a revised version appearing in 1986 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #86:1>
Some would , however , argue that such changes do not indicate advancement , but are reflections of changes in public attitudes and societal norms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #87:1>
It can't be denied that the idea of mental illness is dependent to a large extent on societal and behavioural norms , how else can one hope to differenciate differentiate abnormal from normal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #88:1>
This argument is , like the previous one , largely dependent upon one 's basic belief about the existence of mental illness and abnormality , and therefore the applicability of having the medical model at all .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #89:1>
If one believes in the concept of mental illness then one is more likely to endorse a model like the medical model , but if one does not believe that mental illness exists then such a model is useless .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #90:1>
One favours a model that agrees with ones one 's fundamental beliefs about the causation of the behavioural phenomena in question .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #91:1>
PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES/CRITICISMS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #92:1>
Other practical criticisms have been raised , against employing the medical model .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #93:1>
For example it has been argued that treating such people as ill and admitting them to hospital for extended periods of time , is counter-productive and harmful in the long run , because it encourages them to be passive recipients of &ldquo; treatment &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #94:1>
Research suggests that institutionalization is a common phenomenon , the prominent features of which appear to be passivity , apathy and withdrawal for from social interaction ( Barton , 1959 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #95:1>
These problems are further exacerbated because such individuals suffer the stigma of being labelled mentally ill in one way or another .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #96:1>
They often have to cope with negative public attitudes towards the stereotyped image of the mentally ill , borne born of ignorance and fear .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #97:1>
Also , unlike the labelling of many physical illnesses , this sort of labelling is not easily lost ( Rosenhan , 1973 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #98:1>
COUNTER ARGUMENTS TO PRACTICAL CRITICISMS
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #99:1>
Although these criticisms are serious they do not discredit the fundamental goals of the medical model .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #100:1>
They do however reflect the problem of attempting to treat illnesses when their causes are not well understood .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #101:1>
As a result many health authorities are employing policies of deinstitutionalization and aim instead to provide support in the community .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #102:1>
It is hoped that with increased community involvement , public attitude might also change , and thus reduce the harmful effects of labelling .
<ICE-GB:W1A-007 #103:1>
The results of such policies , have yet to be seen !

<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #1:1>
&lsquo; Perfect &rsquo; Man , &lsquo; New &rsquo; Woman and Sacred Art
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #2:1>
Like Isis searching for her dead husband Osiris , I have pursued the scattered body of the Goddess through the religious art of the world in an attempt to recover her meaning for the use of my work as a woman and an artist in the context of my particular culture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #3:1>
I have seen her both divine and degraded in the Christian world , celebrated but contradictory in the Hindu Buddhist tradition , valued but hidden in Islam .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #4:1>
And everywhere I have seen that as the Feminine is realised in art and religious metaphysics so it is projected on to the actual bodies of women in society who are then both adored and abhorred in the process .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #5:1>
Like Isis I cannot but grieve over the dismembered body of my mother and try best I can to put back together the parts of her , positive and negative , that I have found reflected in the sacred images of the world in order to make some kind of whole that might breathe again .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #6:1>
Only this will put new life into both my own imperfect vision and the unbalanced view of the Patriarchal perspective .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #7:1>
The concept of &lsquo; perfect &rsquo; man which was inculcated by the Christian Church has never been able to cope satisfactorily with the demands and needs of the physical organism of the body .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #8:1>
Few of our great saints and theologians have managed to ever transmute sexual energy into spiritual energy ( as in the Tantric tradition ) in a way that does not in the end deny the sanctity of the physical expression of love ( even though they often express their experience in terms that are undeniably orgasmic . )
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #9:1>
The Biblical erotic poem that is the Song of Solomon has been variously interpreted by the Judaic/Christian tradition as a metaphor for Israel 's love for Yahweh or the Church 's relationship with God as the Bride of Christ .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #10:1>
Yet it has far more in common with the love songs of Innana for her son/lover Tammuz that was a feature of the sensual celebration of the Goddess tradition - the Primordial Paradise where sex was not a sin .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #11:1>
I began this thesis with images of the positive , generous sexuality of the ancient Turkish deities and I conclude , with the inescapable fact that , bar the Tantric tradition , it is the sexuality of the Goddess , and consequently real women , that has suffered most in the process of transition that the Aryan heroes brought into the world 's symbolic art forms so variously enshrined in each religious tradition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #12:1>
But the denial of sanctity to instinctual animal nature that is the cause of the eradication of pubic hair on the body of the icon of woman is a source of pain for both sexes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #13:1>
Collectively as well as privately we suffer from a loss that makes us all victims and our culture the poorer , as Margaret Mead said in my opening chapter .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #14:1>
We see the fruits in our present day crisis over child sex abuse - an emotive area at the best of times and one where it seems easy to apportion blame .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #15:1>
But in a world where the &lsquo; hero &rsquo; hero √≠ values hero √≠ values of competition and conquest are no longer useful but merely serve to breed ego insecurity in the public and private life of men unable to cope with the pressure is it any wonder some sad , unhappy souls forsake their humanity and turn to the bodies of their children for what they often think of as &lsquo; love &rsquo; - children whose pre<l>pubsecent prepubescent hairlessness does not threaten their fragile masculinity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #16:1>
The removing of body hair renders women acceptable in the same way that the innocent , child 's face of Marilyn Monroe rendered her a suitable image for male fantasy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #17:1>
In the &lsquo; enlightened &rsquo; West we think we think we value human love and the need for positive sexual expression but what we really think is reflected in the way we behave .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #18:1>
However much we hold up the image of the compassionate mother in the Virgin Mary as an ideal it is a fact that our pornography overflows with images of women bound and subject to men 's perverted sexual needs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #19:1>
Pornography is the ideal of sexual man where the &lsquo; perfect &rsquo; woman fulfils his physical needs in whatever way he dreams .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #20:1>
As such it is as &lsquo; romantic &rsquo; as the love stories that are the staple diet of women 's magazines where the &lsquo; hero &rsquo; will take all the initiative and the &lsquo; heroine &rsquo; need not trouble herself to act .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #21:1>
We all live with false gods in the sexual realm and this is the outcome of the deposition of the Goddess .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #22:1>
For example , we cannot , given the language of pornography in our culture , view an image such as Figure 121 as anything but obscene and unspeakable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #23:1>
This Tantric Yogini expresses her sexual dynamism in both the movement of her dance and the snake that emerges from her vulva but her face above all this activity is meditative and serene .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #24:1>
The snake is the Tantric symbol of the Kundalini energy that must be transmuted through its journey up the spine where it opens each chakra on its way to the Lotus of Bliss in the top of the head .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #25:1>
It is this energy that both women and men must tap to achieve enlightenment - an enlightenment that does not , as in our traditional view of it , transcend sexuality but incorporates it into a greater vision .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #26:1>
This was the knowledge enshrined in the Great Goddess traditions where the snake 's eternal shedding of skin ( ego ) and rebirth gave the initiate access to Her wisdom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #27:1>
However , in a culture where Eve and the serpent have been seperated separated and enmity put between them forever by God 's command , it is not possible for us to see this image as holy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #28:1>
In the Koranic vision of the Garden of Eden of figure 114 the snake at least appears friendly - if rather relegated to the status of a household pet wriggling in the background .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #29:1>
In our depictions of the Fall the association of sex with the Devil is far more prevalent and so we see how woman = temptation = instincts = Satan has irrevocably affected our outer world view and divided our inner idea of ourselves despite all our modern efforts to rationalise the dichotomy away .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #30:1>
In terms of sacred art and images of women generally for a long time that paradox did not seem to matter and the coexistence was fruitful in terms of art and architecture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #31:1>
The iconography of the Middle Ages , had had for its heritage a knowledge of nature and the instincts that was a feature of Celtic and Anglo saxon Saxon art and was happily expressed in aggressive animals , twisted stylised human forms and fiendish monsters to be found even in Illuminations in the Gospels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #32:1>
This set the scene for an iconography that included the best - and the worst of human imagination .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #33:1>
William Woods , in his book &lsquo; The History of the Devil &rsquo; , says : &ldquo; In the early days Satan had invariably been a spirit , but by the time of St Martin in the 5th Century he had become palpable , weighty and , of course , visible .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #34:1>
In the Medieval cathedrals the devil found his place in the hierarchy of spiritual order and was given delightful and varied expression .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #35:1>
Figure 122 , The Temptation of Christ from the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre of Troys Troyes ( C1170-80 ) is one of my personal favourites .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #36:1>
Here the Devil is depicted in strong complimentary complementary colours green against a red background .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #37:1>
Christ is far less powerfully conceived and drawn by comparison but wins the day by virtue of the extra radiance of his aura of blue .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #38:1>
In Figure 123 of the Gossips , an English piece made between 1325-40 the similar cartoon devils appear tempting the women while they talk by whispering in their ears .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #39:1>
This image , from later in the Medieval period , is charming but also prefigures the sinister turn soon to be seen in the outer world where the witch-hunts are set to begin and women 's knowledge ( God 's skip ) was to be demonised and denied .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #40:1>
The confusion inherent in the split persona of mind and body that was part and parcel of the mythology of the Christian world would eventually take its toll in human lives .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #41:1>
Joan Wynn Reeves in her book , &lsquo; Body and Mind in Western Thought &rsquo; Body and Mind in Western Thought √≠ Body and Mind in Western Thought √≠ sums up the results thus : &ldquo; It wanted only the monarchies and mechanistic physics of the Seventeenth Century , to transform these tempestuous topics of certain knowledge , freedom and the basis of evaluation , into a veritable cat 's cradle of enquiries , within which mind-body problems became inextricably knotted
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #42:1>
Since the Reformation and the Protestant ethic the Devil and the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven have disappeared from our religious art and sacred iconography has become denuded of both the powers of nature and the vision of wholeness that was encapsulated in the image of the Feminine Principle .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #43:1>
No wonder it declined so rapidly in the Northern European tradition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #44:1>
But when the devil was where we could see him at least we knew where he was -
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #45:1>
now we have no safe repository for that power that might prevent us from acting on the worst of our instincts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #46:1>
Nor do we know what he looks like any more so we are inclined to see Satan in anything that does not measure up to our ideal image of God .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #47:1>
The favourite scapegoat of our society has been , not surprisingly , the female body and that instinctual nature that was consigned to the darkness of chaos with the devil outside the temenos of our sacred spaces . [ C ]
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #48:1>
As Esther Harding says in &rsquo; Psychic Energy &rsquo; , our religious symbols have been stripped of numinous power :
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #49:1>
So how do we bring back into our sacred art and our images of women the numinous power of the ancient goddess and what is the truth that lies hidden in our patriarchal tradition ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #50:1>
Is it , as Feminists sometimes say , a deliberate plot , or is it , I would prefer to say , a terrible mistake that we as fallible human beings are prone to make in either sex but here affects the lives of women most harshly and unjustly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #51:1>
Here I find myself in the same position of Innana on her return from the underworld with eager to wreak vengeance on those who left her to rot on Erishkigal 's peg and usurped her &lsquo; magnificent throne &rsquo; in her absence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #52:1>
When she fixes her &lsquo; eyes of death &rsquo; on Tammuz and condemns him to take her place forever in the underworld she is condemning the lover without whom she is bereft and life would have no meaning - ( as did all the mother goddesses who could not but kill their own sons when they showed any independence of spirit ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #53:1>
I suffer from Innana 's dilemma in that if I deny any value to the sacred imagery of the Patriarchy because it musrdered murdered the Goddess in order to survive , then I will also have to reject the beauty of all those images I have chosen that celebrate the Feminine despite her demise .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #54:1>
This is the world in which I have grown up , it is part of my being and to deny it would be to reject part of myself that must also have a value and meaning if only I can redeem the truth from its Patriarchal prejudices .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #55:1>
Everywhere it seems that the Feminine has been both a source of man 's greatest spiritual aspiration and the object of his greatest fear .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #56:1>
Love of the transcendental image of the Virgin Mary was what gave birth to the glorious cathedrals of the Gothic world and the love of real women has inspired works of art as diverse as Dante 's Inferno and the Taj Mahal in India - let alone the beautiful metaphysics of the Divine Sophia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #57:1>
In the Islamic world Ibn 'Arabi was spiritually moved by the Lady Nizam and wrote poetry about her that created a great deal of disapproval among his contemparies contemporaries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #58:1>
However , it seems to me that , since the Middle ages Ages , much of this inspiration has been derived more from being &rsquo; in love &lsquo; with an idea of the feminine that than true love for the whole spirit that makes up the reality of that ideal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #59:1>
As anyone who has been in love knows underneath the delight and desire that makes for such inspiration is a powerful urge to possess and dominate the object of attention that usually only catches us out when the &lsquo; Beloved &rsquo; fails to live up to our fantasy or worse , rejects us . ( B )
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #60:1>
In that romantic love is very selective in what it sees in the Beloved it will reject any quality in the object of desire that does not fit its needs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #61:1>
This is also the case on the public and political level where the image of woman has been made to conform to the needs of Patriarchal ideology both spiritually and materially . (
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #62:1>
C )
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #63:1>
The images of the female that we see around us in our time are thus consequently debased and are either brutal or sentimental .
<ICE-GB:W1A-008 #64:1>
They are a travesty of the truth - both about the instincts that as human beings we all share and the Feminine nature that women know from their position inside the myth as well as their living out , or not , of its projection .

WHY HAS INTELLIGENCE EVOLVED ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #2:1>
&lsquo; Behaviour &rsquo; has now been incorporated into modern evolutionary theory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #3:1>
It is recognised that natural selection acts on phenotypes and not on genotypes , and it is acknowledged that behaviour constitutes a significant part of phenotype expression .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #4:1>
It follows that &lsquo; intelligence &rsquo; may be considered as an adaptationary set of behaviours which have evolved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #5:1>
Intelligence has been defined as &ldquo; an adaptation to the physical and social environment &rdquo; ( Piaget , 1950 ) , and as &ldquo; actively grasping the essentials in a situation and responding appropriately to them &rdquo; (
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #6:1>
Heim , 1975 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #7:1>
These and other definitions emphasise what has been called &lsquo; the Evolutionary Analogy &rsquo; ie. the parallel between the processes that account for biological evolution and those that account for cognitive phenomena including creative thinking and intelligence in man .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #8:1>
Some writers have hardened the analogy to assert that cognitive development and evolution are the product of identical processes ie. the establishment of matching relationships between features of environmental order and aspects of organismic organization .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #9:1>
The analogy in its strong form may help in understanding/explaining the evolution of intelligence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #10:1>
The concept of &lsquo; Evolutionary Epistemology &rsquo; forwards an answer to the question of why ( and how ) intelligence has evolved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #11:1>
It is an approach to evolution that has been fostered by biologists with a particular interest in cognition , intelligence and culture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #12:1>
The essence of evolutionary epistemology is as follows :
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #X13:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #X14:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #15:1>
( Plotkin , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #16:1>
Before elaborating on the concept of evolutionary epistemology , it is necessary to consider &lsquo; evolution &rsquo; in detail .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #17:1>
Evolution , or more specifically phylogenesis , can be described in terms of three principles/processes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #18:1>
1 ) variation 2 ) selection , and 3 ) heritability .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #19:1>
The &lsquo; generate-test-regenerate ( test-regenerate ) &lsquo; g-t-r &rsquo; heuristic can be used to describe how variants are generated ( genes and genotypes ) ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #20:1>
they are tested ( by natural selection processes ) ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #21:1>
and the successful variants that have passed the test phase are regenerated
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #22:1>
( the further propagation of genes and genotypes ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #23:1>
The g-t-r heuristic is based on a mix of conservative and chance components .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #24:1>
The conservative component lies in the fact that certain aspects of the genotype , having been tested previously by past environments , are returned to the gene pool to be carried forward by future generations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #25:1>
There is a &lsquo; blind &rsquo; assumption that the future of the population will be the same as its past .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #26:1>
The radical chance component lies in the gene and chromosomal mutations , recombinations and interactions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #27:1>
The main issue in evolution/phylogenesis is how populations deal with changing environments / &ldquo; uncertain futures . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #28:1>
Environmental change may be classified as population-dependent or independent , and as sudden , gradual or cyclic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #29:1>
How the rate of change compares with the &lsquo; generational dead time &rsquo; / &lsquo; generational lag time &rsquo; ( ie. the time between the moment of reproduction by a parent generation , t0 , and the moment of reproduction by the offspring , t1 ) is important .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #30:1>
If environmental changes are slow ( ie. the rate of change is greater than t1-t0 - the generational dead time ) , the genetic mechanisms of information gain can cope with / adapt to them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #31:1>
However , phylogenesis cannot know about or cope with &ldquo; quick &rdquo; changes in the environment which occur within the generational dead time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #32:1>
The &ldquo; uncertain futures &rdquo; problem has several possible outcomes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #33:1>
Firstly , the most common outcome is extinction of a species .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #34:1>
Secondly , a population may attempt to avoid/minimise environmental change : by selection of / isolation in niches/habitats where change is negligible eg. migratory flights of insects and birds &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #35:1>
parental care in certain species , notably birds and mammals , may serve a buffering function against change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #36:1>
A third alternative is the track change strategy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #37:1>
To track environmental change the gene pool must be able to : a ) maintain and continuously update an adequate reserve of variants - via sexual reproduction , gene mutations , gene interations interactions , - by reducing the generational dead time , - or by simply increasing the number of offspring in each generation &semi; also b ) switch between alternative forms of phenotypic expression ( via gene pool changes ) or flexible phenotypic responses ( changes by the individual organism . )
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #38:1>
However , all avoid change and track change strategies employed by a population of organisms in response to environmental change are limited to what has been preprogrammed by phylogenesis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #39:1>
As long as a population is wholly dependent for its fitness upon phylogenesis , there will always be some upper limit to the amount or rate of environmental change that can be tracked or avoided .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #40:1>
It is for this reason - to overcome the constraints arising from the generational dead time limit imposed by phylogenesis , that supplementary forms of information gain have evolved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #41:1>
The new ways of gaining information comprise the second , third and fourth levels of the hierarchical model of evolution proposed by evolutionary epigenesis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #42:1>
The four levels of the model are the genetic , the epigenetic/developmental , the individual learner ( &lsquo; intelligence &rsquo; exists here ) and the sociocultural level .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #43:1>
The hierarchy gains knowledge which is an important causal component in the form that adaptations take .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #44:1>
The original , most fundamental level of knowledge gain and storage is the genetic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #45:1>
Large numbers of genes , many occurring in different allelic forms , exist at the genetic level of a species .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #46:1>
The rate at which this level can effect adaptations to the phenotype is restricted by the rate of generation turnover .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #47:1>
Changes of higher frequency cannot be detected by this level
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #48:1>
and if such changes are significant in detrimentally affecting the fitness of an organism , then they become the selection pressures for the evolution of the subsidiary levels of the hierarchy , each of which is sensitive to higher frequencies of change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #49:1>
Each level of the hierarchy is thus a tracking device that is tuned to even higher frequencies of change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #50:1>
The supplementary information-gaining processes ( levels two , three and four ) have evolved in response to appropriate selection pressures acting at the &lsquo; test , t &rsquo; phase of the phylogenetic g-t-r heuristic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #51:1>
Sustained &ldquo; unpredictability &rdquo; of within-generation events selects for adaptability mechanisms that are left &ldquo; open &rdquo; by phylogenesis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #52:1>
Such innate multipurpose adaptability mechanisms have phylogenetically predetermined operating characteristics/tolerance limits &semi; and must have been equipped by phylogenesis wih with a capacity for autonomous information-gaining .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #53:1>
At level two , the epigenetic/developmental level , there exists a relatively plastic developmental program responsive , within limits , to a range of environmental circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #54:1>
Epigenesis gains information by allowing interactions to occur between the environment and a range of alternative developmental routes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #55:1>
Epigenetic mechanisms can cope with a changing environment which affects the organism during development -
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #56:1>
they may possibly increase the capacity of an individual organism to track or avoid change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #57:1>
However , the capacity of epigenesis to deal with change is still limited -
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #58:1>
it cannot respond adaptively to any environmental changes that recur and reverse , possibly rapidly and frequently within the lifetime of an individual .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #59:1>
The third level of the model - the learning-cognitive level , consists of a subsystem of additional information-gaining processes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #60:1>
These specific innate adaptability mechanisms can be seen to act as &lsquo; defence mechanisms &rsquo; which do not have to know in advance what they will have to defend against .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #61:1>
One example is the vertebrate immune system ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #62:1>
another is the learning system / the capacity for &lsquo; intelligence &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #63:1>
There are many forms of learning which , via the organism 's direct interaction with the environment , can track/gain knowledge of events that occur rapidly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #64:1>
At level four , the socio-cultural level , there is a very rich network of knowledge ( especially when this level is present in a species like man ) , which can be gained very rapidly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #65:1>
For example , an individual can acquire information from a conspecific / another organism of the same species .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #66:1>
The reason for the four levels of the hierarchical model of evolution having the capacity for operating at different rates needs to be emphasised/reiterated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #67:1>
The rate at which knowledge is gained via selection and propagation of phenotype attributes that are wholly genetically determined , is fixed absolutely by the parameter of generation time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #68:1>
Levels two and three comprise knowledge gaining and storing processes that , because they work via within-organism and not between-organism evolutionary processes , are freed from the limitation of generation time , and thus can effect adaptations at higher rates .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #69:1>
At level four the existence of non-genetic information transmission between individuals frees it from the genetic generation time limitations of level one .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #70:1>
So , &ldquo; Why has Intelligence evolved ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #71:1>
The limitations of phylogenesis and epigenesis in coping with unavoidable unpredictable environmental change has given rise to selection pressures responsible for the evolution of learning and intelligence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #72:1>
Learning/intelligence provides the fine behavioural tuning to cope with the &ldquo; uncertain futures &rdquo; problem .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #73:1>
Acting as a source of additional behavioural phenotypic flexibility , &lsquo; intelligence &rsquo; permits individual organisms an increased capacity either to avoid change , or to track change , or both .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #74:1>
It thereby increases the probability that an individual will contribute to the &lsquo; regenerate , r &rsquo; phase regenerate , r √≠ phase regenerate , r √≠ phase regenerate , r √≠ phase of the phylogenetic g-t-r heuristic , which , in turn , will increase the probability that the population to which the individual belongs will be successful .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #75:1>
Thus Evolutionary Epistemology proposes that : &ldquo; Intelligence is a subset of processes by which animals gain and utilize knowledge about themselves and their worlds ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #X76:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #77:1>
( Plotkin , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #78:1>
&lsquo; Intelligence &rsquo; resulting from innately guided learning is found at all levels of mental complexity in the animal kingdom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #79:1>
Examples can be drawn from the behaviour of bees and birds and primates .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #80:1>
An organism may be innately equipped to recognise when it should learn , what cues it should attend to , how to store new information , and how to refer to it in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #81:1>
Bees can learn about flower odour , colour , pattern and the time of day at which flowers provide nectar .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #82:1>
There is evidence that various strategies exist in insects , birds and mammals for learning to recognize and respond to various kinds of predators and enemies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #83:1>
The learning of songs in birds has a number of parallels with the learning of speech in humans .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #84:1>
Also , the ability to make and manipulate cognitive categories
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #85:1>
and hence the ability to perform cognitive trial and error ie. to evaluate alternatives and formulate simple plans is possessed by bees , some birds and animals , as well as humans .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #86:1>
This perspective allows one to see why various animals are &lsquo; smart &rsquo; / intelligent in the ways natural selection has favoured , and &lsquo; stupid &rsquo; where their life-style does not require a customised learning program .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #87:1>
The human species is intelligent in its own ways ( for example - the use of language for verbal and written communication ) and comparatively backward/stupid in others .

Celtic History
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #90:2>
To what extent , if at all , can a Pictish identity be established ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #91:2>
The main problem confronting any study of the Picts is the complete lack of source material , or even archaeological evidence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #92:2>
The only documentary evidence that is definitely Pictish is a list of the kings , and the main archeological evidence is the symbol-stones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #93:2>
As can be imagined , this lack of evidence has caused a whole myriad of conflicting theories about the nature of the Picts to spring up .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #94:2>
The Picts were first mentioned in writing in 207 , and to compound the problem , this reference was an anachronistic comparison .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #95:2>
From that point on the Picts were more or less regularly mentioned in imperial panegyrics up to the departure of the Romans from Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #96:2>
The name , Picts , was then picked up by Dark Age monastic scribes up to their mysterious disappearance in the mid-nin e th ninth century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #97:2>
The first question that naturally rises out of this confusion , is what was actually meant by the classical terminology of &lsquo; Pict &rsquo; , and why it had had it such staying power ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #98:2>
The terms term seems to have been originally coined by Roman soldiers who used it to describe the northern tribes who apparently dyed or tattooed their skin .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #99:2>
The ancient writers , furthermore , seemed to apply the word &lsquo; Picti &rsquo; to describe the tribes living north of the Antonine wall in a very loose sense .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #100:2>
When the term is picked up by monastic writers it seems to aquire acquire a more precise meaning with the passing of time &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #101:2>
one speaks of a Pictish kingdom for instance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #102:2>
The first descriptions of the barbarian tribes of north Britain came with Agricola 's campaign into northern Britain , which is covered extensively by Agricola 's son-in-law , Tacitus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #103:2>
Tacitus calls northern Britain Caledonia , and the tribes , Caledonians .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #104:2>
Agricola 's campaign , as it turned out , was not exactly successful ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #105:2>
and the frontier , which had been made and at the Forth-Clyde line , was pushed back to the Tyne - Soy Solway line only 25 years afterwards .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #106:2>
In effect no Roman military expedition could ever hope to control Caledonia , when the Caledonians had the protection of the Highlands .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #107:2>
The next group of barbarians to be mentioned in northern Britain were the Maeatae , in about 200 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #108:2>
The historian Pio Cassius claimed that all the tribes in Scot Caledonia had grouped themselves under either the Maeatae or the Caledonians .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #109:2>
A century later the Picts are first mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #110:2>
Judging by the context of the usage of the word &lsquo; Picti &rsquo; , one could imagine it to describe the tribal groupings of Caledonia , as it speaks about &lsquo; Caledonians and other Picts &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #111:2>
Due to the lack of material concerning the Picts , they have aquired acquired a sort of mysterious if not mythical character .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #112:2>
Their apparent matrilinearity and unique symbolism has made some scholars try to prove that they had a unique ( for northern Britain ) non-Indo European society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #113:2>
Other scholars such as Smyth and Alcock have done their very best to prove that the Picts <unclear-words> were a classic north-west European barbarian nation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-009 #114:2>
Due to the extreme lack of evidence <unclear-character> all of these theories take on a certain <unclear-word> plausibility related to the skill of arguing given by the author , but all nearly all tend towards the circular argument .

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #7:1>
The Oxford English Dictionary states that to isolate is &ldquo; to place apart or alone &semi; separate ( especially infectious patient from others ) &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #8:1>
Indeed , isolation is a condition endured by many , if not all humans .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #9:1>
Every character , whether intentionally , or not , is apart from his fellow being .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #10:1>
Literature reflects this , to a large extent .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #11:1>
In numerous instances the individual is responsible for his isolation ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #12:1>
more often , though , he can be absolved from any blame .....
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #13:1>
Isolated characters are prevalent in the vast majority of the Narrative and Cultural texts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #14:1>
Frankenstein and the monster he creates are mere examples ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #15:1>
likewise are Tom Jones , Partridge and Sophia Western who are victims of a society all too eager to isolate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #16:1>
Oedipa Maas finds herself isolated in the modern world as she pursues her quest in the hope of understanding more about Pierce Inverarity , whose wealth she is to benefit from as a result of his death .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #17:1>
Eve isolates herself , from the teachings of God , in succumbing to Satan and thus alienates Adam , not to mention the rest of mankind .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #18:1>
Jo is the archetypical isolated person in Bleak House , whilst Troilus and Criseyde are isolated from the outset and , despite finding companionship in each other , become further isolated as the poem continues .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #19:1>
Aeneas suffers perpetual isolation as he wanders from place to place , having lost those whom he loved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #20:1>
Nevertheless , it would be foolish to look at the subject of isolation merely as it applies to certain individuals .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #21:1>
It encompasses the whole of society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #22:1>
T. S. Eliot portrays a world that has been tarnished by mankind 's sheer inability to communicate with each other ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #23:1>
it is a world which is lonely and sterile .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #24:1>
Similarly , the society that Oedipa Maas is living in has isolated itself , so too has the world in which Tom Jones inhabits .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #25:1>
In choosing to isolate certain individuals , mankind as a whole serves in alienating itself .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #26:1>
In all walks of life there exists exist people who feel it necessary to take on the role of the typical schoolbully school bully , prepared to isolate and exploit others .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #27:1>
As ever , it is the character who suffers from some kind of disability or other disadvantage , of no fault of his own , who has to endure torment and inevitable isolation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #28:1>
This is the case in each chosen text .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #29:1>
In BH , Esther is made to pay for the fact that she was illegitimate , as is Tom in Fieldings Fielding 's Tom Jones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #30:1>
As a result of this they find themselves isolated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #31:1>
Any judgment of them is coloured by their birth :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X32:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #33:1>
Master Blifil calls Jones : &ldquo; a beggarly bastard &rdquo; and succeeds in provoking him so much that he strikes him and suffers rejection as a punishment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X34:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #35:1>
Debora uses this to disguise her part in the proceedings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #36:1>
Almost from the outset of her birth Esther is forced by her Godmother and later Mrs Rachel , the housekeeper , to recognise what she describes as : &ldquo; her inheritance of shame &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #37:1>
She is made to feel guilty that she were even alive .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #38:1>
Similarly , a significant factor ( of no direct fault of Oedipas Oedipa 's ) is behind her initial isolation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #39:1>
This is her being executrix to Pierces Pierce 's will .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #40:1>
Criseyde is primarily isolated by the regrettable fact that she is a widow .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #41:1>
Aeneas is at a disadvantage ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #42:1>
the will of the gods makes his destiny and subsequent isolation not a matter of his own choice .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #43:1>
The monster in Frankenstein is beset with incredibly unattractive features which render any personal progress in life impossible .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #44:1>
He soon finds , like the incredibly large or thin pupil at school , that very few people are prepared to be associated with him .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #45:1>
Adam , Eve and Frankenstein , as well as the inhabitants of the Wasteland , are not hindered from the outset b by any disability of which they have no control over (
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #46:1>
though one might say that Eve is , purely by being born into a world where man was to have power and authority and women as their subordinates ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #47:1>
They bring about their own isolation and that of , and that of others , through their own ignorance and irresponsibility .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #48:1>
They have their own companions ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #49:1>
Frankenstein has a very caring family and the opportunity to make friends at University , Adam and Eve have each other , whilst the inhabitants of the Wasteland miss the chance to form meaningful relationships amongst themselves .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #50:1>
Societys Society 's own misjudgment , arrogance and misplaced pride all contributes contribute to isolation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #51:1>
In BH , the upper classes are shown to be too proud to integrate with the likes of Jo and incur a blemish upon their image and self esteem .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #52:1>
When they do communicate &semi; , the conversation is always carried out on their terms ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #53:1>
they succeed in manipulating the other speaker :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X54:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X55:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X56:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X57:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X58:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #59:1>
Those who do integrate always make us fully aware of this , as is the case with the foreign philanthropists .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #60:1>
They make others feel guilty and isolate them :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #61:1>
Mrs Jellyby accuses Ada , before ignoring the poor , wounded and dirty Peppy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #62:1>
Indeed , Dickens was particularly concerned with the fact that many philanthropists were helping the less needy abroad , whilst turning a blind eye to problems nearer home .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #63:1>
In TJ , Partridge , himself an isolated character , is unable to tolerate the beggar in the street ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #64:1>
he is contemptuous seeking to preserve his image .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #65:1>
Fielding shows us him giving the poor man a : &ldquo; severe rebuke &rdquo; concluding that &ldquo; Every parish ought to keep their own poor . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #66:1>
Society 's readiness to reject the isolated , serves in isolating further .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #67:1>
In FR the professor fails to give his monster the benefit of the doubt ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #68:1>
he is so appalled by his features and too proud to come to terms with what he has created , and openly admit that he was responsible for him , that he isolates both himself and the monster .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #69:1>
This sense of disgust is suffered by Tom and Jenny Jones as well as Partridge and JO Jo and is detrimental to all concerned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #70:1>
Society builds up such a strong sense of morals that conformity is seen as essential .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #71:1>
It is self deluding ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #72:1>
Mrs Wilkins feels that she has to disguise the truth that she is Tom 's Mother n and isolates herself further in the long run from Tom , by doing so .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #73:1>
The philanthropists delude themselves in their belief that they really are helping the poor , at the expense of the likes of Jo .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #74:1>
Similarly , Mrs Western deludes herself into perceiving that she is helping her niece and succeeds in isolating her from her family , as well as jeopardising her own relationship with her brother .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #75:1>
God , like Frankenstein , angered by the product that he has created , punishes it's its misbehaviour by isolating it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #76:1>
Similarly , Adam is too proud , initially , to be isolated with the corruption of Eve .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #77:1>
He starts accusing and disassociating himself from her :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X78:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #79:1>
The Westerns threaten to isolate Sophia , angry at the damage her behaviour will incur on the family prestige .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #80:1>
The concept of pride , as a contributory factor in the isolation of a character , is inherent also in The Aeneid .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #81:1>
Dido 's pride has been dealt a severe blow .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #82:1>
She is unable to accept Aeneas ' decision , and is almost hysterical about the prospect of isolation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #83:1>
Characters often isolate others in an attempt to disguise their own misdemeanours and faults .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #84:1>
In doing so they behave hypocritically .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #85:1>
This is the case in TJ , where the religious world is embedded in hypocrisy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #86:1>
Those who are expected to set an example , from Square to Allworthy , fail dismally .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #87:1>
Indeed , Allworthy , the so called so-called pillar of the community and chief exponent of justice , is all too susceptible to the influences of those who are eager to isolate Tom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #88:1>
He wrongfully misjudges Tom , Partridge and Jenny , not to mention Blifil .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #89:1>
His only answer to his errors , and those of others , is to isolate them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #90:1>
Unable to endeavour to form a closer understanding and &ldquo; parental &rdquo; influence over Tom , his solution is to offer him some money and tell him to leave the district .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #91:1>
Partridge is forced , through Allworthy 's misjudgment , to endure a period of wandering , whilst later Blifil is paid off in order that he goes into &ldquo; exile &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #92:1>
Nonetheless , hypocrisy is no better shown than in the character of Blifil .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #93:1>
Whilst one could excuse Allworthy as merely naive , Blifil 's hypocrisy is more outright .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #94:1>
He poses as the benevolent , responsible and kind hearted youth to all , succeeding in deceiving society ( but never the reader ) , into believing that Tom is a dishonest and badly behaved individual .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #95:1>
Blifil 's hypocrisy is the root cause behind the isolation of Tom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #96:1>
His plain nasty and arrogant disposition makes the prospect of marriage ( to him ) unbearable to for Sophia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #97:1>
This , as well as her regard for Tom , made her isolation inevitable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #98:1>
Frankenstein protects himself by failing to reveal that he was responsible for the monster which wreaked destruction on those close to him , until it was too late .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #99:1>
In doing so he isolates Justine and , of course , those physically killed by his creation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #100:1>
He also isolates himself , needing to carry out his work , in making a mate for the monster he isolated , in total solitude .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #101:1>
Predictably , this adventure is impossible to carry out .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #102:1>
Greed is another reason for character 's characters ' isolation of others .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #103:1>
It is greed which leads to the isolation and rejection of the poor in Bleak House , as it is behind the exploitation of the people by the commercial world in The Wasteland .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #104:1>
Here , Eliot portrays an industrial and commercial society which is an oppressive and alienating ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #105:1>
it overworks the black clad commuter and office girl so that they neglect their communicative and social skills , immersed in the rigours of their mundane and stringent routine .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #106:1>
This is , indeed , a system which is external to the individuals within it and which turns these individuals into objects , machines or things , in a desire to accumulate as great a profit as is possible .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #107:1>
Greed has led to the wealthy getting wealthier and the poor even more alienated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #108:1>
This is a society which has neglected it's its principals principles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #109:1>
Jo is isolated by his ignorance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #110:1>
For Jo much of daily life is outside his knowledge ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #111:1>
Jo 's ignorance keeps him apart from a world which has refused to educate him .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #112:1>
He cannot understand signs , advertisements , messages , literature ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #113:1>
he is even excluded from religion &semi; unable to comprehend or participate in prayers , hymns , sermons :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X114:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #115:1>
Frankenstein fails to provide even the slightest education for his monster ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #116:1>
he , like Jo , is isolated by ignorance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #117:1>
He has to educate himself :
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X118:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #X119:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #120:1>
The greed of mankind is evident in COL49 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #121:1>
The desire for money has a corrupting influence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #122:1>
Pierce unscrupulously uses the bones of fellow human beings as an aid to his commercial world , using them for decorative purposes at his lake for water skiing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #123:1>
Jaguer has to isolate himself , running away from a client who wants to sue Pierce for non payment of nonpayment for the bones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #124:1>
The workers at the Yoyodyne plantation are isolated by the commercial commercially oriented practices of their employees .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #125:1>
The management 's intention to join the whole plant together by crediting the whole company and not individuals for their own products , serves in alienating the creator from his creation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #126:1>
It is an impersonal system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #127:1>
&ldquo; Zapf 's &rdquo; book shop is burnt down purely for the insurance money , whilst the whole Trystero affair and the isolation it causes stems partly from money and desire for it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #128:1>
Thurn and Taxis having , as is suspected , wrongful monopoly of the European postal system in the past , caused Trystero to claim to have been disinherited of its ownership of postal rights and the subsequent wealth and power that such control produced .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #129:1>
It is wealth , the fact that Pierce had it and is giving it to Oedipa , which sets her on her isolated quest .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #130:1>
Oedipa , though , remains more of the curious than greedy disposition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #131:1>
In Paradise Lost , Eve 's curiosity is tinged with an element of greed , as she picks the fruit from the tree .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #132:1>
She shows herself to be greedy for independence and power in the world which , even at that early stage , appears to be male dominated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #133:1>
Adam is the instructor ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #134:1>
he is the manipulator , the one who makes the decisions -
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #135:1>
she shines for his sake - isolated from the knowledge that he possesses : described in terms of her looks rather than ability .
<ICE-GB:W1A-010 #136:1>
She becomes greedy ( and who can blame her ) for recognition .

<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #2:1>
Pastoralists rely on animals for their food and livell livelihood .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #3:1>
Pastoralism was much more widespread in the past than at present .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #4:1>
It is generally found in marginal areas such as the semi-area step steppe area of Eurasia and the arid , desert area of North West Africa .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #5:1>
These harsh environments have a large degree of seasonal fluctuation which makes migration necessary and so leads to a nomadic lifestyle .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #6:1>
Pastoralist societies have often been noted for the acephalous nature of their political organisation due to their dynamic lifestyle when allegiances are constantly being formed and broken .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #7:1>
There are four distinguishing features of pastoralism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #8:1>
The first is the culling , breeding and selecting of animals .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #9:1>
The second is the extensive use of natural resources - water and pasture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #10:1>
The third feature is that production cannot be intensified &semi; due to ( i ) the carrying capacity of the land and ( ii ) the fact that , regarding reproduction , animals cannot easily respond to increased demands .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #11:1>
Pastoralism takes place in high risk areas where drought , disease and raiding are commonplace .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #12:1>
Therefore they it is advantageous to herd a combination of animals .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #13:1>
If one species is wiped out by disease there is always something to fall back on .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #14:1>
In case s case of drought camels can last a long time without water ( and also provide a good means of transport ) but sheep and goats need constant watering .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #15:1>
The herding strategies differ from animal to animal and place to place .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #16:1>
For example the Lapps who herd reindeer migrate 100 100-150 km annually whereas the Bedouin migrate 1000-1800km annually .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #17:1>
Labour is probably the primary &lsquo; technological &rsquo; restraint .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #18:1>
A fine balance must be found between herd size , combination of animals and the number of people they can support .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #19:1>
Labour is needed for milking , watering and supervision .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #20:1>
Usually labour costs are low but there are peak times such as the dry season when watering takes up a lot of time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #21:1>
The Tuareg of North West Mali overcome these con costs by pooling their herds so only a few men are needed for supervision and the rest concentrate on watering .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #22:1>
The Bedouin meet labour requirements ( if they are short of hands ) by adopting kin of distant relatives , or buying slaves .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #23:1>
However the increase in group size must be kept within the carrying capacity of the land .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #24:1>
If herd size is small and group can't sustain a group alternative lifesty ly lifestyles must be resorted to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #25:1>
This of leads to a completely sedentary way of life .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #26:1>
However , as we can see from <unclear-character> Swift 's economic account of pastoralism it is not just the poor whole n who make the transition to sedentism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #27:1>
This is exemplified in Barth 's account of the Basseri of Iran .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #28:1>
With increasing herd wealth the &lsquo; net productivity &rsquo; decreases and labour costs rise .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #29:1>
Hence wealthy pastoralists may convert some of their assets into land wealth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #30:1>
They buy land along lr migration routes and le rent it out to land labourers attaining stable economic returns .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #31:1>
This may lead to a conversion to sedentism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #32:1>
Although , th Basseri organisial organisation includes a levelling mechanism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #33:1>
When sons marry fathers must give them a proportion of his herd .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #34:1>
The more sons a man has the more labour ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #35:1>
and so the larger he can make his herd .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #36:1>
But this is coupled with the greater sectioning off of his herd .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #37:1>
The same principle applies with polygyny .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #38:1>
Many of the technological constraints of labour can be overcome by co-operation as previously mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #39:1>
However the Basseri have no social cohesion that promotes this .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #40:1>
For example , with the simple digging of a well a large amount of pasture could be reclaimed but they had no organisational features wi to allow for this .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #41:1>
So they could only exploit the environment as it stands .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #42:1>
Pastoralists cannot survive on meat products alone and there are varying degrees of interaction with surrounding communities , in the form of trade , land-ownership and semi-agricultural activities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #43:1>
Trade often to maintain an energy balanced diet often imposes constraints on pastoralists because they don't have the technological capacity to store food since their products are are perishable and they are nomadic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #44:1>
So they can't wait <unclear-character> until the market is advantageous .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #45:1>
For agriculturalists meat is a luxury item .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #46:1>
It In times of hardship , such as drought , townspeople hoard grain and have no disposable income for buying meat .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #47:1>
This raises the price of cerials cereals and lowers the price of meat .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #48:1>
They Pastoralists must sell more animals to meet buy grain and so meet nutrient requirements .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #49:1>
<unclear-character> Their diet decreases due to lack of pasture and water which leads to smaller herds and less milk .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #50:1>
This can often spiral into famine for the pastoralists , such as that of Sahel in 1973 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #51:1>
There is a determined argument that claims that mobility is due to environmental constraints .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #52:1>
Bunham however doesn't agree with this view .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #53:1>
He states that in individual and group relations are independent of the environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #54:1>
Local groupings in the long term determine genealogical structure via social flux when allegiances are constantly formed and broken .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #55:1>
This inhibits political centralization .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #56:1>
The Nuer can be seen as an acepalou acephalous society although authority resides in lineages that control water and pasture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #57:1>
However there have been highly hierarchical societi pastoralist s groups such as the Mongols who , through intense military organisation were able to conquer a huge area of land , maintaining an empire that negotiated trade routes between the East and the West .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #58:1>
With the rise of the modern nation state con came boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #59:1>
Pastoralists emphasise resources rather than territory and therefore are reluctant to ad adhere to such boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #60:1>
The Barsen , for instance , are perceived as dispre dispep disrespectful , problematic peoples because they chose to wander between Iranian and Russian borders instead of settling and down and paying taxes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #61:1>
In conclusion then we can see the varying technological constraints on pastoralism - both internal and external to them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #62:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #63:2>
In his comparative sul studies of Melanesia , Polynesia and North West America Mauss formulated his opinions on the gift .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #64:2>
&lsquo; Essai Sur Le Don &rsquo; conveys the relationship of objects and subjects as being inseperable inseparable due to qualities emboddied embodied in the gift .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #65:2>
This quality is &lsquo; the spirit of the gift &rsquo; or its &lsquo; hau &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #66:2>
The &lsquo; hau &rsquo; is the magical , religious and spiritual power of a gift .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #67:2>
It originates from productivity in nature and is striving to return to its origins .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #68:2>
It is the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; of a gift that creates obligation to give in return .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #69:2>
A gift is inseperable inseparable from its &lsquo; hau &rsquo; and thus in re giving and receiving a cycle of exchange is set up whilst simaltaneously simultaneously establishing personal , economic , and political ret relations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #70:2>
Underpinning this principle is that a gift pertains to a person
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #71:2>
so reprocity through objects creates bonds of persons .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #72:2>
The giving and receiving of a gift is paralleld parallelled with the giving and receiving of one 's &lsquo; spiritual essence &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #73:2>
Not re Not returning a gift allows for retribution in via spiritual sanctions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #74:2>
Therefore Mauss saw no little differentiation , in Maori society , between subject and object .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #75:2>
Mauss goes on to ask vital questions about Western society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #76:2>
Why do we dichotomise between subject and object ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #77:2>
And did our fragmented commodity exchange system &lsquo; evolve &rsquo; from &lsquo; primitive &rsquo; societies whose pivotal aspects are gift exchange .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #78:2>
Raymond Firth criticises Mauss for dwelling too much on the spiritual side of things .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #79:2>
He differentiates between the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; of objects and land as opposed to the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; of people .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #80:2>
He redefines &lsquo; hau &rsquo; as the inner nature of material things , not a quality that 's striving to return to its origins ( for which he finds no evidence in Ranapiri 's text ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #81:2>
Declaring that one cannot rely on spiritual retribution , he takes the more economic approach functional approach .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #82:2>
Soci According to Firth social sanctions for not returning gifts take three gift exchange take three forms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #83:2>
The first is potential exchange in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #84:2>
The second is a person 's reputation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #85:2>
And the third is that &lsquo; hau &rsquo; acts as a route for witchcraft .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #86:2>
An aggrieved giver can instigate witchcraft wi which takes place the through the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #87:2>
Therefore Firth offers a much more secular rather than spiritual excha explanation for gift exchange , encompassing the definate definite distinction between subject and object .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #88:2>
Sahlins in the &lsquo; Stone Age Economics &rsquo; Stone Age Economics √≠ makes two basic points concerning this subject .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #89:2>
He refers to the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; as the &lsquo; yield &rsquo; of a gift .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #90:2>
He declares that profit can't be made because the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; exists to stop it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #91:2>
In this sense religi he reveals tension between religious and economic ties .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #92:2>
This is manifested in the three party Maori exchange system A &double-arrow; B &double-arrow; C when the original donor recie receives return gifts from B ( who has given and received from C ) due to the &lsquo; hau &rsquo; of the gift .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #93:2>
So Sahah Sahlins Sahlins ' interpretation relys relies on social relations and economic implications since retribution takes the form of social sanctions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #94:2>
The other major point he raises is in addressing the question of &lsquo; why give in the first place ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #95:2>
Since the gift is the medium of social contract it unifies a potentially fragmented society &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #96:2>
the social contract between people then is created through objects .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #97:2>
Implicit in Sahlins Sahlins ' work is that gift exchange undermines mams man 's propensity to war and violence
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #98:2>
so objects allow for a simple social contract for peace .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #99:2>
Annette Weiner takes a completely different stance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #100:2>
She emphasises the objects themselves .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #101:2>
Beginning with the maxim that objects establish our identity through time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #102:2>
<unclear-word> This ho historical identity of the object ( encorporating incorporating previous owners owners ' personalities , conquests , struggles and influences ) go to to form an intergral integral part of the present owners owner 's or holders holder 's identity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #103:2>
What is really important is the immortality and eternity certain sacred objects bring .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #104:2>
Meuble - masculine - expendable
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #105:2>
Immeuble - femine feminine -
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #106:2>
only immeuble have &lsquo; hau &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #107:2>
cloak In her analysis of cloaks - no can't seperate separate &lsquo; hau &rsquo; of object from its object - if you lose the cloak - lose power &ampersand; prestige - significance of objects - project power and prestige
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #108:2>
&right-arrow; next page has conclusion
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #109:2>
In conclusion then we can see the relationship between subjects and objects , interpreted in various manners , as one of the fundemental fundamental qualities in all societies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #110:2>
We are ordered It establishes Gift exchange establishes social relations , economic , religious , moral relations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #111:2>
It highlights the differences and similarities among cultures with dif varying forms of gift exchange - The the Kula ring , the Hindu concept of the &lsquo; dana &rsquo; and Western commodity exchange .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #112:2>
It raises questions of generosity , self-interest , morality and social relations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #113:2>
&lsquo; We We &rsquo; are ordered by things and to be a member of a group we must enact some social process provided by our em environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #114:2>
The subject-object relationship determines who we are , how we relate to each other and <unclear-word> how we relate to our varying ecological niches .

<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #119:3>
In the discourse of the transitions to farming those who see it as a question of origins tend to look for technological and demographic reasons whereas those who see it as a process occuring occurring repeatedly through time and space offer a much more social explanation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #120:3>
The transition of gatherer hunting to farming is difficult to assess since due to problematic features such as is there a clear - <unclear-character> cut clear-cut transition and what exactly constitutes agriculturre agriculture rather than food production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #121:3>
However we do have archaeological evidence which indicate indicates climate , demography and social structure .
<ICE-GB:W1A-011 #122:3>

3/ .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #2:1>
This is a debate about whether it is possible for an to represent other societies and cultures without tainting and colouring the presentation with a bias and understanding that comes out of the presenters ' background .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #3:1>
&ldquo; Other people &rdquo; is a wide category that can refer to our own history as well as that of other lands , societies and cultures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #4:1>
For example in December last year there was a very striking article about the museum of London , which although very close to home does represent other people to anyone other than the curator and his ideology because he dictates the angle taken on representing London past and present in an indigenous-centric fashion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #5:1>
Items he collects now for use in the future can range from the sublime to the ridiculous and in my opinion distort the image of London society , if in fact that is what it represents and not <unclear-character> just a small fraction of British society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #6:1>
The article talked about &ldquo; social relevance &rdquo; and the latest items accessioned were a plastic cat litter scoop and a plastic desk tidy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #7:1>
Displayed in a cabinet with a label what can such objects tell of society , culture and the people . ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #8:1>
Rather it tells of the curator .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #9:1>
This argument can be seen by reading Nicholas Thomas 's article about representation in Fiji of the indigenous society and material culture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #10:1>
Early explorers and merchants uninterested in conquering and controlling Fiji had re collected items of curiosity value , particularly spears and other &ldquo; savage &rdquo; implements .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #11:1>
Such limited scope when exhibited <unclear-characters> &ldquo; at home &rdquo; by these collectors gave the impression of an &ldquo; uncivilised &rdquo; , raw people .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #12:1>
Later plantation owners reinforced the idea when they found the Fijians hard to employ .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #13:1>
It was not untill until von H&uumlaut;gel , whose background led him into investigation of &ldquo; other peoples &rdquo; began to make strenuous efforts to collect and understand a very wide range of pottery utensils and other items that a completely different side of these people was seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #14:1>
It was however used harnessed by colonial power and used to superimpose the colonial government on the people themselves , but <unclear-characters> collection and display was were also fashionable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #15:1>
The Governor 's wife &ldquo; artistically &rdquo; displayed the items with geometric precision in her drawing room , using aesthetic comprehension but also symbolising the rigidification of the Fijian society by the colonisers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #16:1>
After this period , how did exhibitions treat Fijian &ldquo; artefacts &rdquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #17:1>
Far from being solely items of &ldquo; savagery &rdquo; the &lsquo; craftsmanship &rsquo; and &ldquo; industriousness &rdquo; of the people was emphasised encouraging further exploitation and market links for the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #18:1>
This example clearly shows how the choosing and presentation of artefacts can totally not only misrepresent people , but also carries messages of power and opportunities for exploitation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #19:1>
Stocking argues a fine case about museum representation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #20:1>
He says that it is writing is a two dimensional representation prone to bias ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #21:1>
but artefact display is three dimensional with the added dimensions of time , wealth , aestha aesthetics and power ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #22:1>
and no display can overcome the problems associated with these dimensions in representing &ldquo; other people &rdquo; , an
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #23:1>
nor can they be separated from each other .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #24:1>
Shanks and Tilley cite a range of examples that cover the problem of the temporal dimension .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #25:1>
The major point that recurs through their discussion is that the social actors who can make the exhibitions real are not there .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #26:1>
Although there is some validity to this point , as it is one without an answer I do feel we have to make the best of what we have and can do and accept the ideal representation as unachievable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #27:1>
The presence of the observer or visitor changes the situation anyway
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #28:1>
and so interpretation is always open .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #29:1>
Actually visiting the people of other societies whether as ethnographer or tourist can always only g allow interpretation from outside ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #30:1>
and indigenous members do not analye analyze or compare their way of life to the extent that outsiders do .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #31:1>
For these reasons I find Shanks &ampersand; Tilley as perfectionists or destroyers looking for ideal representation or destroyers of best attempts with the hindsight of no a century or so of misrepresentation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #32:1>
Shanks and Tilley are correct I believe in describing some exhibitions as inventory on display .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #33:1>
Social relations are not apparent from a mass of lightly , if at all labelled , items .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #34:1>
The Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford is a a good example of mass representation with cross cultural emphasis , attempting to span all temporal and geographical boundaries by categorising objects by similarity worldwide .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #35:1>
A recent Here the museum is overloaded with material that cannot be displayed to describe the society or culture associated with them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #36:1>
The material of a people carries significance of the relations that bounded that society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #37:1>
It would be very hard to understand the Nuer society for example as studied by Evans Pritchard .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #38:1>
He remarks that the Nuer had be very few items of material culture , mostly associated with their cattle , but a very complex organised anarchical society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #39:1>
Evans Pritchard points out that because they had such little material , each item rep might represent a myriad of social relations and the bases of their society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #40:1>
Cow bells and other decorations were social ties , not just items .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #41:1>
Recent attempts at livelier representation satisfy me no more than old style stately remoteness prep presentation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #42:1>
At the Museum of Mankind I find the repetition of description as tiring and as the <unclear-character> fabricated coldness of the Arctic display .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #43:1>
Imagination may be misleading in more traditional displays but can sow the seeds for discovering more if one wants to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #44:1>
Too &ldquo; real &rdquo; an exhibition is still an artificial representation and is a coercive form of information .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #45:2>
2/ .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #46:2>
Whether technology can be considered as the &ldquo; motor of society &rdquo; is a chicken and egg debate
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #47:2>
and I am not convinced there can be any clear cut answer .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #48:2>
It may be argued that from two sides , that of technological determinism or social determinism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #49:2>
Ingold in &ldquo; Hunters , Pastoralists and Ranchers &rdquo; is clear in his expression that technology is &ldquo; a corpus of knowledge alongside aspects of ideological and structural organisation that mediates between man and society and man and his environment &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #50:2>
He goes <unclear-character> on to say that social ly determinants produce it but there are ecological and environmental constraints to its appearance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #51:2>
Although this definition is encompassing , it still leaves much unsaid , and does not allow for the passing on of invention from one society to another that may not be socially prepared for it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #52:2>
Writing is a technology that has revolutionised societies , but also controls them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #53:2>
Developing first as an expression of society and an administrative tool , with the advent of the phonetic script and later printing press it has changed and homogenised societies by a process of literacy and literary coercion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #54:2>
Ernest Gelmer in &ldquo; Nations and Nationalism &rdquo; sees this technology , as used in education to be the backbone of capitalist society and a requirement of the division of labour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #55:2>
Education and writing equip people with the skills to satisfy the demands of capitalist production , and by its coverage allows <unclear-word> creates a homogenous society not allowing freedom or diversity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #56:2>
Esther Goody in the her coverage of the Daboya weavers however gives an example of the resistance to a technology that could change and upset the social relations , and in so doing rejects modernity for traditionalism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #57:2>
There the communities were socially adjusted to an industrial pattern that would be upset by the adoption of new techniques which would have improved production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #58:2>
Wisdom of the elders saw that such adoption would destroy the fabric of their society , creating tensions , conflict of interests and redundancy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #59:2>
Its status system and controls would be out of hand and their culture would be engulfed by the larger society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #60:2>
In a collection <unclear-word> of essays called &ldquo; Human Problems and Technological Change &rdquo; Spicer tells the history of the Papagos Indians <unclear-word> in N. America who lost their culture by adopting an outside <unclear-characters> technology at the turn of this century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #61:2>
Admittedly it is unlikely that their culture could have survived under all the external pressure put but Spicer traces the death of their culture due to the wheel , in the form of a wagon .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #62:2>
Pre wagon days there was much sharing of tasks , and clear cut roles for male/female and age divisions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #63:2>
Following the wagon , the need for social divisions and relations that had existed for centuries was rapidly destroyed
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #64:2>
and the &ldquo; people &rdquo; disappeared being engulfed by the larger and spreading society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #65:2>
In Neema Behl 's discussion of an Indian village and the &ldquo; equalising of status &rdquo; associated with the introduction of television we see again how old social links are destroyed by a technology that is new and not evolved from that society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #66:2>
However , although it evolved within this society it has had tremendous effect in a totalising way as discussed by Raymond Williams in &ldquo; Television &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #67:2>
So this debate is endless whether looking at &ldquo; primitive &rdquo; societies or modern .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #68:2>
whether or n I find no happy answer and am <unclear-character> unsure of the concept of &ldquo; progress &rdquo; that is associated by with the word &ldquo; motor &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #69:2>
Whether it is a socially initiated kick that brings out technology , or technology that responds to an environmental kick is <unclear-word> particular to each example one may choose in relation to any society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #70:2>
It seems to me though to be a steamroller of culture , homogenising and industrialising a society of peoples in diverse circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #71:2>
It is a transformer of society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #72:2>
Perhaps in contrast to the Victorian welcoming of technology , and its offshoots of industrialisation and &ldquo; affluence &rdquo; technology is now a motor <unclear-character> out of control that has harnessed the people rather than being a tool of society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #73:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #74:3>
&ldquo; Civilisation &rdquo; can mean many things to many people , and equally a hallmark is a standard set that has only relative value depending on the &ldquo; object &rdquo; in question .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #75:3>
However , writing has to be considered as a turning point in human development , both of consciousness and social relations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #76:3>
Levis Levi Strauss however in the Savage Mind sees any mind as a structure which is clear until it is built upon ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #77:3>
and in that the &ldquo; savage mind &rdquo; is equally as capable as that of the &ldquo; civilised &rdquo; mind , if in fact not actually clearer because of it is free of many of the distractions of a civilised mind .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #78:3>
It is uncluttered without the heaviness of documentation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #79:3>
So why <unclear-word> might writing be considered the hallmark of civilisation ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-012 #80:3>
and what has it brought to society that its absence leaves out . ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #1:1>
Question 5
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #2:1>
A number of definitions can be applied to the label &lsquo; Newly Industrialised Country &rsquo; ( NIC ) in terms of which countries should be included in this group .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #3:1>
Some groupings include Spain , Portugal and Greece while others concentrate on countries which have traditionally been viewed as &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; countries Third World √≠ countries Third World √≠ countries Third World √≠ countries Third World √≠ countries Third World √≠ countries and which have displayed rapid economic and industrial growth over the past three to four decades .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #4:1>
Such countries include the four South East Asian Tigers of South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore and the two major Latin American powers of Mexico and Brazil .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #5:1>
While the latter definition may be somewhat restricted , it will serve for the purposes of this essay .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #6:1>
In order to address the questions of whether these undoubtedly &lsquo; elite &rsquo; few countries will increasingly be joined by other industrializing countries , it is necessary to look at the conditions under which the existing NIC's emerged and also to consider the replicability of their experiences .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #7:1>
The emergence of the NIC's in the 1950's and 60's in S.E Asia and Latin America seemed at the time to vindicate the development theory of &lsquo; modernisation &rsquo; by which all countries would ultimately follow the same path to development along the same lines as Western Europe .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #8:1>
Modernisation theorists claimed that capilatism capitalism had proved its superiority over Marxist theories of development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #9:1>
However , a close look at the nature of these countries ' development experiences will reveals that certain conditions existed which cannot be applied to all other countries at all times .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #10:1>
The growth of the NIC's in S.E Asia was undoubtedly facilitated by the general upswing in the global economy in the post war decades .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #11:1>
In the case of South Korea , US military and civil aid supported the economy immediately after the Korean war and it was the very withdrawal of this aid which in part initiated industrialisation in that country .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #12:1>
Between 1954 and 1966 , exports from South Korea increased by 44% .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #13:1>
Other factors which stimulated industrialisation in this region were the fact that the NIC's had all experienced <unclear-characters> import substituting industrialisation ( ISI ) before switching their economies to export oriented industrialisation ( EOI ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #14:1>
This had furnished the NIC's with an infrastructure and industrial base from which growth could really accelerate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #15:1>
The role of Trans-National Corporations ( TNCs ) was also significant in S.E. Asia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #16:1>
Japanese companies in particl particular took advantage of the low labour costs and established assembly plants producing electronic goods and textiles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #17:1>
Another important <unclear-characters> factor was the repressive , autocratic nature of the government in the NIC's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #18:1>
Not only did this provide an attractive environment for TNC investment , it also kept the workforce in check subdued by breaking up strikes and Trade Union movement .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #19:1>
One final consideration aiding industrialisation in the S.E. Asian NIC's was the traditional reverence for hard work , authority and education ( the Confucian ethic ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #20:1>
Having looked at the factors which precipitated phenomenal growth rates in the NIC's , it is possibly possible to comment on their replicability elsewhere in the Dev Less Developed World .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #21:1>
The first point which suggests that the experience cannot be a general one is the fact the that such rapid growth on a world-wide scale would rapidly exhaust natural <unclear-word> resources .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #22:1>
Such production would also flood world markets
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #23:1>
eg. If if China and India both exported at the same rate as South Korea , they would account for over 1/2 a half of world trade .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #24:1>
Another factor against widespread repetition of the NIC experience is the contraction of foreign investment in the &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #25:1>
TNC investment was particularly important in Latin America , mors more so th than in S. Korea .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #26:1>
However , a number of factors have conspired to redirect such investment to the more advanced economies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #27:1>
In 1955 , &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; countries World √≠ countries received 1/2 of were host to half of all direct foreign investment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #28:1>
By the mid 70's they received only a quarter of such investment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #29:1>
It should be mentioned that this decrease is relative rather than absolute .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #30:1>
The main reason for such a redirection <unclear-character> is that improved technology in production has undermined the chief advantage that poor countries had to offer TNC's - that of cheap labour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #31:1>
The acceleration of the debt <unclear-word> crisis also makes it unlikely that other countries will follow the same path as the NIC's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #32:1>
The NIC's of S.E Asia and Latin America funded much of their industrialisation through borrowing and are now the highest debtors in the world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #33:1>
It is unlikely that financial institutions will be quite so profligate in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #34:1>
Finally , the current world recession makes rapid progress for LDC's for even even more unlikely .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #35:1>
It is therefore clear that , for the present , the existing NIC's will remain an elite few .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #36:1>
<unclear-character> One question that arises is that of whether the condition of the NIC is one to which other <unclear-word> LDC's should aspire .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #37:1>
Undoubtedly , LDC's want to modernise , but it is clear that the NIC model of development comes with at cost - namely , a very high foreign debt accompanied by political repression .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #38:1>
South Korea is presently experiencing civil rioting and inflation of 14% .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #39:1>
While this is low compared to many other LDC's it would seem that industrialisation is not a &lsquo; panacea &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #40:1>
It is useful , in conclusion , to cite the theory of Wallerstein who identified a world system based on a division of core , semi-periphery and periphery .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #41:1>
He said that at some times , some countries may move up or down the hierarchy hierarchy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #42:1>
It is possible that some countries such as Indonesia , Malaysia and Colombia may experience growth and join the elite few , but this will by no means be a general experience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #43:2>
Question 8
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #44:2>
Environmental degredation degradation continues apace in Latin America , most notably through the rapid deforestation of the continent with all the attendant problems of species extinction extinctions , oxygen depletion and loss of wilderness .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #45:2>
One of the major factors which can be identified as contributing <unclear-characters> to such degredation degradation is the persistent failure of Latin American countries to carry out thorough agrarian reform .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #46:2>
Latin America suffers from the most unequal land tenure system in the world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #47:2>
Consistent attempts to rectify the imbalance have generally failed , mainly due to lack of sincere committment commitment to such schemes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #48:2>
The system of land tenure is a direct inheritance from the colonial past of the continent .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #49:2>
Spanish &ampersand; Portuguese settlers imposed their haciendas onto the Indian population and from then on , land has meant power in Latin America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #50:2>
The pattern of land division remains today , with most land belonging to a few rich families who guard their property jealously and with whom agrarian reforms tend to be very unpopular .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #51:2>
Production on the large &lsquo; latifundi &rsquo; esta estates tends to be capital intensive and is increasingly based around the techniques of the Green Revolution .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #52:2>
While such methods do increasing increase agricultural production ( although not necessarily foodstuffs for the rural population ) they do require the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which can poison the surrounding environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #53:2>
Even larger units of land , often achieved through the amalgamation of neighbouring estates , are needed for ranching beef cattle , often for export to North America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #54:2>
These ranchlands often <unclear-character> encroach onto forests in the search for new pastures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #55:2>
Thus , the large scale nature of rural activity is obviously damaging to the environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #56:2>
However , the corollary of such expansion is even more serious .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #57:2>
It results in land that was previously used for intensive peasant production being taken up for less efficient agro-industrial production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #58:2>
Peasant farmers are being pushed onto increasingly marginal land as a direct result of the failure to carry out effective agrarian reform .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #59:2>
It is on this marginal land that some of the most damaging environmental degredation degradation occurs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #60:2>
For example , slopes and <unclear-character> in the Andes and in parts of Mexico , peasant farmers who used to work on the lowlands have found that the mechanisation of agriculture has taken their jobs away .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #61:2>
They are forced to farm on steep slopes unsuited to such activities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #62:2>
This results in rapid slope and soil erosion and in gullying , rendering the land useless for agriculture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #63:2>
A similar scenario occurs around the margins of the Amazon basin , where farmers are forced landless farmers are forced to encroach onto onto the forest margins in order to subsist .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #64:2>
These This again leads to deforestation and erosion of the fragile soil .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #65:2>
As already mentioned , land <unclear-word> redistribution schemes are very unpopular with landowners .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #66:2>
These landowners are often politically very powerful and can overturn legislation that they feel threatens their land holdings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #67:2>
Such opposition has lead led to an increase in land colonisation schemes schemes , in which landless peasants are allocated land in , as yet , un-cultivated areas .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #68:2>
Such colonisation programmes are carried out in Amazonia but pose severe threats to the environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #69:2>
Again , they promote deforestation and soil exhaustion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #70:2>
The The above examples show clearly that the failure of agrarian reform is certainly a major factor in explaining environmental degredation degradation in Latin America , but it is by no means the only explanation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #71:2>
Equally important in terms of forest depletion is the continuous logging of the forests .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #72:2>
Estimates of actual depletion vary widely but it is true that Central America has lost most of its tropical forest since during the post war period .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #73:2>
Also important , and inextricably linked to large scale logging is the foreign debt crisis that most Latin American countries face .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #74:2>
The export of tropical hardwoods , in particular to Japan where such resources are highly valued , is an important way of earning much needed foreign currency .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #75:2>
It is hypocritical in the extreme for Western Banks and governments to condemn Latin American countries for cutting down their tropical forests when it <unclear-character> is the very conditions that the west ( in part ) <unclear-character> imposed on these countries which makes make such activities necessary .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #76:2>
Failure to implement effective agrarian reform has undoubtedly been veg very important in explaning explaining environmental degredation degradation in Latin America although it should be mentioned that some countries , such as Peru , have made significantly better progress than others .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #77:2>
Other explanations include foreign interests and in beef and logging and <unclear-word> the debt crisis that faces those countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #78:3>
Question 2
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #79:3>
Patterns of rural-urban migration are clearly clearly not uniform among less developed countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #80:3>
On a continental scale , differences can be identified in the nature of such migration in Latin America and Africa .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #81:3>
Latin America is the most urbanised continent in the &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; -
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #82:3>
an estimated 75% of the population lives in settlements of more than 20,000 people .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #83:3>
Urbanisation has been occurring for considerably longer time in Latin America than in Africa and the process has now slowed down considerably , having passed its peak in the early 1970's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #84:3>
Africa convesed conversely conversely , is only 25-30% urbanised by but is now the most rapidly urbanising country continent in the world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #85:3>
The rate of urbanisation is closely linked to rural-urban migration .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #86:3>
In Latin America , urban growth is now thought to be half mostly as a result of in migration and <unclear-word> less mostly a result of natural increase and less due to in migration than has been the case in the case in the past .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #87:3>
In Africa , the proportions are more evenly split between natural growth and <unclear-characters> in-migration .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #88:3>
There are broad economic explanations for those varying proportions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #89:3>
Firstly , Latin American cities grew considerably earlier than those in Africa because that country continent became involved in the global economic system earlier than Africa and there is a clear link between economic development and urbanisation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #90:3>
Latin among American countries also tend to be richer than those in Africa and as a result often have considerably lower rates of population growth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #91:3>
This decrease in growth has lead led to a corresponding decrease in Rural-urban migration in Latin America , while a concurrent increase in the African rural population has prompted increased rural to urban migration in many parts of that continent .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #92:3>
However , it is not merely economic differences between the two countries that cause vrying varying patterns of rural-urban migration ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #93:3>
social and cultural differences also play an important role .
<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #X94:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-013 #X95:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #1:1>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #2:1>
Furthermore , clear groups are emerging within the Third World , ranging from a small group of highly developed countries ( Newly Industrialised countries ) such as South Korea , to a lower middle income group including the richer African states and a clear group of less deve least developed countries , now <unclear-word> commonly called the low income countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #3:1>
Most of these countries are in <unclear-word> Sub-Saharan Africa .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #4:1>
However , although the situation has old terms are difficult to apply at the end of the 1980's , it is not possible to simply state that the real development gap exists between the a bottom group of least developed countries and the rest .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #5:1>
There are many other divisions that are important , operating at many levels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #6:1>
In this case , the least developed countries will be taken to mean the 35-40 low income countries defined by the World Bank , which saw their GDP per capita rates decline in the 1980's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #7:1>
Without a doubt those least developed countries , such as Ethiopia and Bangladesh have done more than the rest of the world 's nations since the 1970's and so a gap , which existed before , has widened .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #8:1>
Mozambique , another country within this group has seen its GDP <unclear-words> decline by 8% per year in the 1980's ( T O'Connor , 1990 ) , while another country that is commonly put in the Third World category , S Korea Brazil , has seen its GDP rise , despite suffering the effects of a severe debt crisis .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #9:1>
In the 1970's , before the debt crisis set in , Brazil was enjoying growth rates of 7% per year , while Sub-Saharan countries like Mozambique and indeed , Haiti , were achieving rates of 1-2% per annum and from a much lower starting level than Brazil .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #10:1>
A real development gap has opened up within the Third World therefore , in the strictest economic terms , since the 1970's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #11:1>
And arguably , because in the 1970's , the higher middle income industrialising countries like Brazil and S. Korea were achieving growth rates far in excess of those in the industrialised nations like the United States , this more developed group of Third World countries has caught up with the West , therefore accentuating the divide between the &lsquo; rest and the least developed nations &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #12:1>
In simple terms a gap development gap does between the 20 35-40 least developed and the rest has appeared and has widened .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #13:1>
However , while it may be possible to paint a general picture of the main development gap being between the least developed and the rest , it is difficult to argue this is the real and most important divide when the situation is analysed more closely .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #14:1>
What has develope emerged is a more at the end of the 1980's , is a much more complicated set of divisions between different groups , with <unclear-words> that do not show up in generalised figures because they are often <unclear-characters> within different countries , rather than between them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #15:1>
For instance , while Brazil may have enjoyed staggering growth rates in the 1960's and 1970's and still maintained some expansion after the effects of over the debt crisis started to be felt severely felt in the 1980's , it has done little for income inequalities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #16:1>
And with the austerity measures imposed after the debt crisis , large numbers of people have actually seen their incomes decline as <unclear-words> while basic necessities have become unaffordable because of the reduction in subsidies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #17:1>
This has hit the people in the rural areas worst .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #18:1>
In Brazil , it is estimated that 73% people cannot meet their basic needs ( Janet Townsend , 1987 - Lat-Am : Gen Perspect. ) , while in Latin America , there was a for the Latin-American population as a whole the figure is 62% .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #19:1>
There has emerged therefore in these more successful Development in these coun more successful , high so called , higher higher <unclear-word> middle income countries such as Brazil and Mexico , has therefore occurred at the expense of the poorer groups and so real development gaps have emerged within countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #20:1>
Similar situations apply in India , a country in the World Bank 's lower middle-income group of 35-40 countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #21:1>
GDP has grown at 5-6% in some years of the 1970's and 1980's , but at the same time the percentage of <unclear-word> people defined as poor , in both urban and rural area has increased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #22:1>
In India , the <unclear-words> Once again a development gap can be perceived within a country . <unclear-words>
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #23:1>
Furthermore , it is very important to look at development in its broadest sense .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #24:1>
<unclear-word> The term &lsquo; development gap &rsquo; does not just mean refer to growth in incomes , ( although this is the most important factor because it underlies everything else ) ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #25:1>
it also implies changes in opportunities , <unclear-word> , welfare and access to amenities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #26:1>
And when the situation is assessed in this way it becomes even more difficult to specify one real development gap .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #27:1>
While people in Ethiopia , it is certain t the welfare of people in the 35-40 least developed countries has probably declined more than in any other country , it is also important to look at peoples ' lives elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #28:1>
Women have certainly not benefited from the greater <unclear-characters> economic success of other Third World countries to the same extent as men .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #29:1>
They have certainly suffered the most in the harsh economic climate of the debt crisis in Latin America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #30:1>
They have much lower access to education , to secondary and/or wage earning possibilities , in all countries across the Third World , although it is fair to say that it is in the least developed countries that they have suffered the most .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #31:1>
Rural people have suffered very badly in terms of welfare in higher income countries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #32:1>
The roots of the violence in Central America which has claimed 100's of 1000's of lives was were in primarily in the <unclear-word> poor agrarian distribution of land , enforcing rural poverty ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #33:1>
but other factors such as lack of access to basic amenities such as water , and services such as education are also important .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #34:1>
Certainly though a development gap exists within the countries countries of Central America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #35:1>
Overall , it is fair to say that a development gap does exist between the 35-40 least developed countries defined in this essay and the rest and that this is a change from the old pattern of the First World/Third World division ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #36:1>
but within this broad pattern there are many divis gaps within the Third World .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #37:1>
It is not therefore possible to say that this broad development gap is the real one .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #38:1>
For there are There are many variations and complex issues surrounding this pattern .

<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #43:2>
The Newly Industrialising countries ( NIC's ) are really made up of 2 groups - the commonly termed &lsquo; Gang of Four &rsquo; and the higher income Latin-American countries of Brazil , Mexico and Argentina .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #44:2>
3-paragraphs These two groups have industrialised through different mean ways , but they are likely to remain an elite few for a number of reasons .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #45:2>
Firstly , these NIC's started developing their industrial strategies before other less developed nations and at times when the worldwide economic climate was conducive to substantial growth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #46:2>
The Gang of Four particularly - S/Korea , Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong - particularly benefited from the boom period that started in the 1960's , just as they were developing an export oriented <unclear-word> approach .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #47:2>
In the late 1970's However , now the world economy is no longer with the coll and early 80's there was an economic downturn
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #48:2>
and world trade declined , while , most importantly , protectionism and bilateral trade deals proliferated , therefore making it very hard for other countries with hopes of industrialization to start up .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #49:2>
Most importantly though , by this stage , the Gang of Four were able to survive , because they had developed to a Arguably , in the next few years there is going to be a be a new boom period This set back the hopes of countries like Indonesia , while S. Korea and the others were able to survive .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #50:2>
But what is more important than the timing of the NIC's in launching <unclear-word> their strategy is their size and impact on the world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #51:2>
Although there is a possibility of another economic boom in the 1990's as a result of the opening up of Eastern Europe , it is doubtful whether the more developed , industrial nations in the OECD would be prepared to accept competition from less developed countries as they industrialized , therefore setting off another round of protectionist world trade .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #52:2>
Additional Para
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #53:2>
When the &lsquo; Gang of Four &rsquo; were industrializing however , they were able to benefit from a high demand period ( partly stimulated by S. Korea 's own st situation ) and from the fact that their output did not overwhelm the world markets .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #54:2>
Alread When Brazil started to launch its export oriented approach in 196 the late 1960's it was already finding some problems in competing because of the impact of on the world market .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #55:2>
For , <unclear-word> , the rest of the developin It is therefore unlikely that a similar policy would be tolerated by other the industrialised nations and indeed , the by the two main groups of NIC's , because it would threaten their position .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #56:2>
In any case the Latin-American NIC's have not done did not do very well during the 1980's as the problems of their loan funded industrialization strategies became apparent and they were forced to cut back on growth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #57:2>
South Korea <unclear-word> also suffered in the 1980's as it had built up a $20 billion debt to finance its industrialization . Overall therefore , external conditions
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #58:2>
External conditions are therefore not in favour broadly in favour of other nations following the same strategy as the NICs ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #59:2>
but internal factors - the characteristics of other countries that would like to be NIC's also preclude against their success and so the continuation of the NIC's as an elite .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #60:2>
Firstly as Clive Hamilton has argued , it is very important to have a firm basis on which to build industrialization - which means reforming the agrarian sector .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #61:2>
Part of the reason why Brazil , and Argentina and Mexico have not been as successful as the Gang of Four is because they have not implemented proper agrarian reform .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #62:2>
Agrarian elites still have a lot of power
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #63:2>
and so farms are inefficiently managed - not guaranteeing adequate food supplies to the towns , even though by enforcing rural poverty they are providing an urban labour force .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #64:2>
In Taiwan and S. Korea , a strict but relatively fair land reform was was implemented , ensuring that agrarian elites did not have the power to undermine .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #65:2>
In countries like Indonesia , India and <unclear-word> the Philippines which are perhaps closest to being NIC's the necessary control of and reform of agriculture has not yet occurred therefore undermining their chances .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #66:2>
Arising from this , it is important to ensure that it is the potential industrial capitalists who have power and not the old agrarian elites .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #67:2>
Once again in <unclear-word> the Gang of Four , this situation applied , and while in Brazil and Mexico the agrarian elites still had significant power , and so <unclear-words> imposed a certain limitation on industrial change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #68:2>
What is clear from this already therefore , is that , contrary to classical or neo-classical economicy economic theory , state intervention is necessary to allow a country to follow proper successful industrialization .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #69:2>
In South Korea the Gang of Four , state intervention was What is very , imp essential though , is its quality and in the Gang of Four , the politica authorities , although very tough <unclear-words> ( as is now very clear ) pursued a successful policy an active policy of intervention , free of sectional interests , to allow industrial development to occur .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #70:2>
However , in countries Furthermore by controlling sectional interests the stat like Indonesia , <unclear-words> or Brazil the state is still not fully free of sectional interests
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #71:2>
and so state intervention does not totally fulfill the criterion of &lsquo; quality &rsquo; even though it is active and aimed at industrialization .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #72:2>
In less developed some countries like Haiti and Zaire , corruption and the detrimental effects of sectional interests are endemic and so seem to preclude successful industrialization along the lines of the NIC's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #73:2>
Furthermore , by controlling sectional interests , the state is also able to control what are known as &lsquo; zero sum &rsquo; activities zero sum √≠ activities which tend to deprive investment from industrialization .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #74:2>
Zero sum activities include a dominance of property speculation and unofficial money lending , all run by elite groups for their own enrichment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #75:2>
Those countries which have a high incidence of such activities tend also to have a parallel lack of savings and investment capital for industry .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #76:2>
Once again the NIC's are less affected by this problem
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #77:2>
and so this too tends to suggest they will remain as elite . overall
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #78:2>
It is difficult to generalize successfully about whether or not other developing countries can catch up with the NIC's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #79:2>
As has been shown Brazil and Mexico have not really <unclear-word> been <unclear-word> as successful as the Gang of Four because they are affected by various problems .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #80:2>
However , their future remains is probably good because they are well endowed with raw materials and have already reached a certain stage .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #81:2>
For other countries though , who have not yet made the necessary changes identified here , their prospects are not so good
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #82:2>
and external conditions will not necessarily help them in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-014 #83:2>
An elite the NIC's are most likely to remain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #1:1>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #2:1>
The Second World War introduced the terms &lsquo; √´ First World √≠ , &lsquo; Second World √≠ and &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #3:1>
When territory agreements were signed at the end , the &lsquo; First World &rsquo; was generally agreed as the allied countries , the &lsquo; Second World &rsquo; was the Communist block bloc and the &lsquo; Third World &lsquo; incorporated all those countries that had no part in the war .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #4:1>
The thinking of these terms soon changed and were became the western developed countries , the Communist block bloc and the less developed countries of the south .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #5:1>
In the past forty five years however , the world situation was very much changed and there are degrees of development amongst the Third World .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #6:1>
Post 1945 , there was a general agreement by the western world to an obligation to help the development of the Third World and also to arrest the spread of communism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #7:1>
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were established to help direct funds for multilateral aid projects and some bilateral aid .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #8:1>
Various opportunities were put before the Third World but were reacted to in different ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #9:1>
Colonialism had kept some countries dependent upon one or two primary products , for example sugar and coffee in Brazil , rubber and palm oil from the Ivory Coast .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #10:1>
In turn they imported manufactured goods ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #11:1>
for example , the multi-national corporation Unilever had palm oil plantations in Nigeria and used the ships it sent over to collect the oil as a means of importing goods and became Nigeria 's largest importer .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #12:1>
However other colonial countries such as India developed a broad manufacturing base and became competitive on the world market , especially in textiles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #13:1>
The dependence on primary products which are highly susceptible to price fluctuations on the world stock exchange led some countries to diversify their economic base into manufacturing , such as Brazil and Mexico .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #14:1>
Mexico had the added benefit of being an oil producer as did Nigeria and they used capital from this to develop their economies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #15:1>
The Middle East countries such as Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Iran and Iraq discovered vast oil reserves and have become very rich oil producing countries distributing some of their wealth throughout the population .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #16:1>
Of the countries creating a diverse manufacturing economic base there are four which have surpassed many of the others in economic development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #17:1>
Taiwan , South Korea , Singapore and Hong Kong expand developed during the 1960s and 1970s when there was also rapid world expansion and the climate was conducive to change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #18:1>
They imported technology , had a strict authoritarian government that kept wage levels down and kept labour intensive to increase production levels continually and flooded the world market with cheap , high technology manufactured goods .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #19:1>
The world economy was at a point where it could absorb these goods such as radios , microwaves , and computers before the recession during the 1980s .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #20:1>
China remained a separate entity remaining virtually self-sufficient and concentrating upon agriculture .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #21:1>
Other communist states within the Third World also suffered from isolation and now have great social welfare problems , such as Ethiopia and Mozambique .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #22:1>
There are thus great variances in the degree of development in the Third World and obviously OPEC countries and Newly Industrialized countries cannot be classed in the same definition with sub-saharan countries suffering extremes of poverty and economic disarray .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #23:1>
Yet the economic clim and social climate throughout the world is changing with the recent events in socialist Europe and the referendum on a market economy within the USSR .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #24:1>
The differences between the &lsquo; First World &rsquo; and the &lsquo; Second World &rsquo; are now becoming less apparent and so I agree that the real development gap is between the least developed countries and the rest with varying degrees of development in between .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #25:1>
However , this is based totally on economic development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #26:1>
Social development does indeed have a long way to go to alleviate the impoverishment and hardship felt by the people .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #27:1>
With regards regard to cultural development however , who is to say what is best
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #28:1>
and maybe everyone throughout the world has a lot to learn and the trend shown in economic development could even be reversed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #29:2>
Question 5
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #30:2>
In their struggle for development and independence some countries have transformed into Newly-Industrializing countries ( NIC's ) and have experienced a boom in the development of their economies and industrial performance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #31:2>
The countries that have achieved this development are those that obtained early independence from their colonists ( if that was applicable ) and diversified their economy to become self-sufficient and less dependent upon world pru commodity price fluctuations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #32:2>
In Latin America , Argentina , Peru , Mexico and Brazil are classed as NICs experiencing rapid growth between the 1930s and 1970s .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #33:2>
In Africa Nigeria has managed to elevate itself when it discovered oil and in Asia the spectacular examples of development to the rest of the &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; have been supplied by &lsquo; the gang of four &rsquo; incorporating Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #34:2>
There Their extraordinary development occurred during a very special world climate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #35:2>
The &lsquo; gang of four &rsquo; had very strict authoritarian governments which maintained a labour intensive workforce whilst keeping wage levels low .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #36:2>
There were no trade unions to negotiate terms and agreements of employment thus holding up production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #37:2>
Export oriented industrialisation was embarked upon and multi-national companies were given favourable conditions to invest in the countries and thus transfer some of their financial wealth and technological expertise .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #38:2>
The developed world was experiencing a period of expansion itself and could absorb the flood of new , cheaper , high technological products which were flooded onto the world market such as computers , hi-fies hi-fis and other electrical appliances .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #39:2>
The other NICs in Latin America , Nigeria , the Philippines also began to b heavily borrow foreign capital , at a time when world real interest rates were low and oil prices were stable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #40:2>
The NICs did indeed become an elite few ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #41:2>
however there is some question over whether they will remain so .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #42:2>
The new economic climate brought on by the raising of real world interest rates by the action of the United States government in order to decrease their state deficit was magnified by the oil shocks when the OPEC cartel drastically raised oil prices .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #43:2>
A worldwide depression has very badly affected the high debtor countries of which Mexico , Brazil , Argentina , Peru , the Philippines and Nigeria are part of .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #44:2>
Their position over the last decade in terms of economic strength was decreased and they have incurred very high social costs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #45:2>
Wage levels have fallen whilst cost of living has increased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #46:2>
Drastic cuts in public spending have effected affected education , health care and infrastructure provision of transport and services .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #47:2>
Many people face great hardship and have to send their children out to work in such menial jobs as street entertainers or shoeshiners or junk collectors .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #48:2>
Necessity means secondary jobs are taken in the informal sector such as taxi-driving .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #49:2>
At the same time , child mortality is increasing and life expectancy is increasing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #50:2>
The strict structural adjustment policies implemented by the governments in accordance with the restructuring priorities of the IMF for debt rescheduling , are continually intensifying these problems .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #51:2>
If this continues and some form of economic recovery is not felt soon then these countries may fall to pre-1945 levels of development and be no better off than other countries whose level of underdevelopment it once escaped from .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #52:2>
Such an economic climate is not favourable to other countries wishing to follow the &lsquo; gang of four gang of four √≠ 's development example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #53:2>
With the recession , the world will not accept further influx of manufactured goods when it is saturated already or will provide greater competition for established goods .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #54:2>
Protectionist barriers are implemented and no help is provided .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #55:2>
Further developments in technology mean multi-nationals no longer have a necessity to locate near cheap labour and prefer to reinvest in their home country or equivalent economies .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #56:2>
The lending policies of the banks are now unfavourable and will not aid development with such high real interest rates .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #57:2>
A new f route for development must therefore be found in order to elevate other less developed countries to a higher status .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #58:2>
The &lsquo; gang of four &rsquo; will remain an elite for some time but will eventually be fully incorporated into the &lsquo; First World &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #59:2>
The other NICs must follow strict policies to prevent themselves from slipping further but they will soon be met by developing countries not far behind them to develop create a new level of development in the ever changing world 's economic climate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #60:3>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #61:3>
The development gap between the &ldquo; first world &rdquo; and the &ldquo; third world &rdquo; has been a concept which has been around for more than a centuary century .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #62:3>
Both Marx and Lenin both formulated theories on how to increase development in the &lsquo; third world &rsquo; in order to decrease the &lsquo; gap &rsquo; between the industrialized countries of the North and the agrarian/subsistence states mainly situated in the South .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #63:3>
The actual term &lsquo; First World &rsquo; , &lsquo; Second World &rsquo; and &lsquo; Third World &rsquo; only came into being after the second world war , and it is these terms which have been under scrutiny since the 60's when they became too generalized to include the massive varieties with the &lsquo; 3rd world &rsquo; of economic and social development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #64:3>
It is therefore from this that there has been recently discussions over th whether whether or not the development gap between the first and third worlds is in fact decreasing whilst the gap between the countries which constitute the 3rd world is widening .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #65:3>
The Third World ( 3W ) constitutes most of Asia ( excepting Japan ) Africa and Latin America and for the past half centuary century the LA world has witnessed the huge economic development by some of these countries , but for others , many influencing factors have prevented this .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #66:3>
Economic development in the form of industrialization has occured occurred throughout most of LA during the 1940's - present 1940's-present .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #67:3>
Development theories such as Rostow 's stages of economic growth have been formu were formulated to help this development , with the ultimate aim of increasing the GNP/capita , increasing the stand standard of living , helping the balance of payments and lastly developing the countries into economically independant independent and self-sufficient units .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #68:3>
However , at this time Africa was still very much under colonial rule , only gaining independance independence in the later 50's and 1960's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #69:3>
Therefore this process to become self-sufficient and economically independant independent was occurred at a later date .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #70:3>
Asia too had become independant independent during the 1940's and was favouring the heavy industrialization path of development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #71:3>
Many LA countries , including Brazil , Argentina and Chile , opted for import-substitution industrialization , a phenomena phenomenon where manufactured good goods are made in the country for a domestic market instead of importing them from abroad .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #72:3>
However this became a vicious circle as they needed to increase the export of raw materials to the 1st world , ( something they wished to decrease ) so as to gain enough capital to import begin the the technology nness .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #73:3>
Later the new international division of labour occurred in the 1960's and Trans/Multinational Corporations ( TNC's/MNC's ) who needed cheap labour for manufacturing products , an already established infrastructure and a source of raw materials , has blossomed within LA .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #74:3>
This has brought the obvious problems and increasing income inequalities , dependancy dependency on foreign capital and technology , some detremented detremental effects on the social aat structure and environment problems in some areas , but it has improved the infrastructure of many towns and even parts of the rural countryside , as well as providing training , skills , pensions , research etc for the country .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #75:3>
Taking it a step further the NIC's , who have been very successful in their economic development with the EOI ( Export Orientated Industrialization ) or Export Promotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #76:3>
These are an elite group comprising of Hong Kong , S. Korea , Tiawan Taiwan , and Singapore ( with Brazil and Malaysia ) as close seconds ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #77:3>
This EOI followed after ISI in the 1960's when the economic global environment was good , and enabled them to export manufactured goods ( as opposed to R. materials ) with state intervention , but fundamentally are successful in there their development programme , with little dependance dependence on the first world for capital , or technology .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #78:3>
Lastly the 1973 oil price rise and cartel by OPEC ( the Gulf States ) has allowed the to poor Arab a countries to suddenly become very wealthy and no longer dependant dependent on the 1st world -
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #79:3>
they are now even major contributors to the World Aid for LDC's .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #80:3>
However , what has not been spoken of yet is the social development or agrarian development .
<ICE-GB:W1A-015 #81:3>
Throughout the LA continent the &lsquo; trickle down theory &rsquo; of the 1960's &ampersand; 70's hadn't really worked , and still today , despite a very significant advance in economic development , there are still massive inequalities in standards of living and income , with still millions who live in &lsquo; absolute poverty &rsquo; in the towns and rural areas .

Question 4
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #2:1>
Once language has been de acquired , auditory feedback is used to monitor the levels of volume and pitch and to regulate the timing and rhythm of speech to keep them constant with the environmental conditions and to ensure comprehension by the speaker 's audience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #3:1>
Studies done on the effect of auditory feedback and the changes in voice pattern as a result of altering auditory feedback have generated theories to explain disruptions to voice and to suggest the role that feedback plays in voice production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #4:1>
Lombard studied the effect <unclear-character> of disruption to the volume of auditory feedback of the subject 's own voice .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #5:1>
He found that when the volume of auditory feedback was increased the subsequent vocal volume was decresed decreased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #6:1>
However , when the volume of auditory feedback was reduced the subsequent vocal volume was increased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #7:1>
Both <unclear-character> these effects provide a regulation in the level of volume of vocal production , keeping it at a constant level in the present environmental situation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #8:1>
<unclear-word> Fleture <unclear-word> also studied the effect of volume levels and auditory feedback , but he used alteration of background noise in the subject 's environment <unclear-characters> as an independent variable .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #9:1>
For this he used different levels volume levels of &ldquo; white noise &rdquo; which the subjects heard through their headphones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #10:1>
Fleture found that when the background noise increased the subject 's vocal volume increased accordingly &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #11:1>
when the background noise was decreased , the subject 's vocal level decreased as well .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #12:1>
Thus the subjects were altering their the volume of their voice voices concurrently with auditory feedback of the background noise volume levels &semi; keeping their voice voices at a consistant consistent level with the background noise of their environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #13:1>
Studies using alteration of feedback in levels of frequency &ampersand; pitch of the subjects subject 's voice show that this aspect of vocal production is also monitered monitored to keep a consistent level of frequency that is within a normal range of voice levels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #14:1>
When That is to say , when frequency of auditory feedback of vocal production is increase increased the level of frequency of the vocal production is decreased , but if the frequency of the auditory feedback is <unclear-character> decrease decreased , levels of vocal production frequency is are increased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #15:1>
The disruption in voice patterns concurrent to altered auditory feedback in the above studies are a explained by Lare , in his description of the role of auditory feedback .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #16:1>
Lare believes that auditory feedback is consistantly consistently monitered monitored for alterations of volume and pitch to keep their ranges within those of normal speech patterns .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #17:1>
This use of auditory feedback is to regulate the vocal productions to maintain <unclear-characters> comprehension by the speaker 's audience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #18:1>
Lare proposes that auditory feedback is not monitored for internal regulation of vocal production but for external comprehension of voice .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #19:1>
Thus pitch and volume are kept constant within a normal range and at a consistant consistent level to background noise levels of volume so that the speaker 's vocal production remains understandable to the audience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #20:1>
Thus volume and pitch of voice are controled controlled for external purposes through auditory feedback but the role of auditory feedback disruption of the process of monitoring the feedback also has disrupting effects on vocal production .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #21:1>
The process of delaying auditory feedback of a subjects subject 's voice through headphones was found by Fairbanks to disrupt speech by the resulting elongation of of vowel sounds &semi; , lack of variation in tone or pitch of voice &caret; a , repetition of various sylables syllables and omission of others and a general increase in volume .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #22:1>
Stelman explained the disruption of voice through an increase in jaw velocity and overshooting the amount of the jaw should be opened , thus auditory feedback was being used to monitor the amount the muscles <unclear-characters> around the throat and jaw were extending and contracting and at what rate this was happening .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #23:1>
In other words Stelman believed auditory that exteroceptive feedback ( i.e. aural feedback ) was used to regulate the motor programs of a closed-loop generated motor control system that determined the use of the gammamotoneurones gammamotorneurons involved in efferent muscle use .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #24:1>
Disruption of the monitoring of exteroceptive feedback resulted in the alphamotor-neurone system ( open-loop ) being the in dominant control of the muscles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #25:1>
The alpha system can only generate movement and cannot control the exte exact extent to which the muscles should be contracted or extended .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #26:1>
This effect results in the &ldquo; overshooting &rdquo; and increased jaw velocity that Stelman proposes is the cause of di the disruptions of delayed auditory feedback .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #27:1>
However further studies on the effects of delayed auditory feedback concentrate on how feedback is monitered monitored .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #28:1>
Lee and Black found that a delay in auditory feedback of 200 m.s. was the most effective in producing disruption to vocal productions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #29:1>
They proposed developed the servo-control theory of auditory feedback , which proposes that speech is constructed of sylables syllables which last roughly 200 m.s .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #30:1>
Each sylable syllable is monitered monitored separately for correct pronounciation pronunciation and whether it is at the right pitch , volume and frequency in accordance to the surroundings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #31:1>
If the sylable syllable is correct then the next sylable syllable is pronounced , this too is monitered monitored .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #32:1>
Thus each sylable syllable is monitered monitored <unclear-words> and regulated , the
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #33:1>
any alteration in auditory feedback is used to alter the next sylable syllable accordingly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #34:1>
Lee and Black believed that this theory explains the asserted disruption to speech rhth rhythms and levels of volume and pitch , as delaying the auditory feedback by 200 ms means <unclear-characters> feedback of the first feedback <unclear-character> occurs whilst the second is <unclear-character> being produced ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #35:1>
subjects might accomodate accommodate to this by speaking slower in order to hear feedback of preceding sylables syllables .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #36:1>
however However , in order to maintain a near normal rhythm of speech the monitering monitoring of the feedback is not so thourough thorough and alterations in pitch and volume are affected .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #37:1>
Alternatively subjects might elongate certain well known sylables syllables to enable more thorough regulation of vocal productions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #38:1>
Thus it appears that auditory feedback is used to regulate vocal productions for external comprehension and internal for the correctness of internal motor programs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #39:1>
Alterations of feedback result s in concurrent alterations of voice production &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #40:1>
however disruption of the monitoring process of the auditory feedback by delaying it results in disruption of the regulating process and vocal productions are indistinct and devoid of correct emphasis as we which makes them incomprehensible .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #41:2>
Question 6
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #42:2>
The development of a skill requires feedback either exteroceptive or proprioceptive or both to build up a template of the correct motor program that generates the correct and required skill .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #43:2>
The use of this template is described by Keele 's general model of skill development and maintenence maintenance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #44:2>
Keele 's model is of a motor program genorator generator in which areas of the brain send signals an efferent outflow of impulses to <unclear-characters> the muscles concerned in the task .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #45:2>
The movement An efferent copy of these impulses is also sent to the comparison centre .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #46:2>
The subsequent movement of the muscles results in exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #47:2>
The feedback and knowledge of results is received through input systems and , <unclear-characters> muscle receptors and kinesmatic receptors and is related to the comparison centre .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #48:2>
Here the actual feedback is compared to the ideal feedback or template for that moment in time .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #49:2>
If the feedback does not correspond exactly then corrections are sent to the motor program genorator generator which then alters the motor program accordingly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #50:2>
However once the correct motor program is developed feedback is not <unclear-word> needed to drive the motor g program , 7-words in complicated skills such as speaking where a sucession succession of coordinated movements is required feeback feedback is used to regulate the motor program , controling controlling the coordination and timing of speech patterns through alterations in the motor program according to errors and alteration of the surrounding environment the speech is being produced in .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #51:2>
However in simpler tasks which have been learnt well , such as walking , and are performed in a familiar environment feedback is no longer needed -
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #52:2>
a process of feedforward is used &semi; , where the set motor program is run without feedback to higher levels in the brain , as this results in an economy of brain processes. subjects are highly primed to the consequences of their actions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #53:2>
in the environ However proprioceptive feedback such as that from muscle spindles is still used but in an autonomic fashion ( thus economising the use of brain processes ) to give a general idea of where the limbs are in space .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #54:2>
In the process of timing a skilled motor task exteroceptive aural feedback is important in maintaining the rhythm of the movement .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #55:2>
Kelsman emphasised this use of auditory feedback in a study where he delayed audtiory auditory feedback in of a clapping task .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #56:2>
The effect of delaying the feedback resulted in severe disruption of the rythm rhythm of the clapping movement .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #57:2>
Thus the timing of learned movements still requires monitering monitoring and regulation of exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback , to maintain the correct timing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #58:2>
However the coordination of skilled movements can function <unclear-words> on a more automatic level .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #59:2>
Fasbury studied the co-ordination in walking using &lsquo; spinal cats &rsquo; ( cats which had had their spinal cords severed from higher mental processes i.e. no feedback to <unclear-words> comparison center centre ) whose motor programs for walking when stimulated were performed normally , not <unclear-words> feedback was needed to generate and maintain the skill performance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #60:2>
Moreover if a paw was tapped just before it was due to be lifted the paw would then be reflexively lifted an increased amount , as if being lifted over an object .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #61:2>
Schmidt ( 1982 ) explained this phenomena phenomenon by describing the motor program for walking - in animals - as being innate and once motivated it was automatic ran without monitering monitoring from the brain ( i.e. open loop system ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #62:2>
He likened the motor program to a computor computer program , which has contingencies that if a certain event ( e.g. foot tapped ) occurs at a particular time in the program ( e.g. just before its it 's lifted ) then the program would be altered reflexively to accomodate accommodate the event before returning to its normal program .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #63:2>
Thus timing and co-ordination of movements in performing <unclear-words> skill <unclear-words> that is not fully developed requires conscious monitering monitoring of exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback whereas timing &ampersand; coordination of movements of a highly learnt skill only requires feedforward and minimal autononic autonomic feedback of position of limbs and any irregularites irregularities in the surrounding environmet environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #64:3>
Question 11
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #65:3>
The forms of amnesia that result from closed and open head injuries are reterograde retrograde amnesia and post traumatic amnesia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #66:3>
Reterograde Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events before and leading up to the injury that caused the amnesia .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #67:3>
<unclear-characters> Post traumatic amnesia is the inability to memori remember events after the head injury and <unclear-characters> is measured by the length of time from the injury to full restoration of working memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #68:3>
The duration of both amnesias resulting from closed and open head injuries are related .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #69:3>
If the retrograde amnesia lasts for only a few seconds then the post traumatic amnesia will usually not last for more than 24 hours ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #70:3>
however , if reterograde retrograde amnesia lasts more than several minuets minutes the post traumatic amnesia can last for several days .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #71:3>
A study by Rogers and Newell on world war II veterans suffering from open and closed head injuries showed that the majority of closed head injuries only had post traumatic amnesia for less than an hour after the injury .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #72:3>
However the majority of open head injury patients had anesia amnesia for up to 3 days .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #73:3>
Thus d the duration of post traumatic amnesia is related to the severity of the injury :
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #74:3>
if the injury only results in unconsciousness then post traumatic amnesia will last up to an hour , whereas if the injury is severe , as in most open head injuries then post traumatic amnesia can last for a few days , and at least .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #75:3>
The effects of post traumatic amnesia are a disorientation of time , where subjects might talk coherently but believe themselves to be living in events that happened to them prev weeks or years previously .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #76:3>
This disorientation is usually accompanied by confabulation which is the rationalisation of pseudo memories to fit into the surroudings surroundings that the patients find themselves in .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #77:3>
Confabulations occur to a certain extent if f patients recieved received the injury during a familiar or routine task , as information from previous experience invade invades &ampersand; confuse confuses the memory of the performing the task at the incident of injury .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #78:3>
During post traumatic amnesia no new information is memorised
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #79:3>
restoration of post traumatic amnesia and retorograde retrograde amnesia in closed and open head injury can occur naturally :
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #80:3>
this occurs through cued recall generating memories or a spontaneous recoveray recovery of memory or through slowly building &lsquo; islands &rsquo; of isolated memories togeather together until memory has been completely restored .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #81:3>
However , two treatments are used to aid memory recovery &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #82:3>
these are barbituate barbiturate treatments which res may result in spontaneous recovery and narcoleptic treatment where an a light anesthetic anaesthetic can aid gradual but permenent permanent recovery of memory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #83:3>
The treatments and natural restoration of post traumatic amnesia and reterograde retrograde amnesia suggest that the memories are not lost through insufficient encoding or consolidation but patients are not able to recall them retrieve them , from due to competitive information long term memory stores .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #84:4>
Question 8
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #85:4>
A protocol is the mon conscious monitoring of a timed movement or skill .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #86:4>
A verbal protocol is a self-report verbalising any thoughts that occur to the subject whilst performing a task ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #87:4>
these thoughts can be relevant or irrelevant to the task .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #88:4>
Thorndyke and Stasz segmented a typical protocol from a thinking-aloud protocol task , where subjects verbalised their thoughts whilst performing a task .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #89:4>
Thorndyke credited any section of thought as part of a protocol which either named an element of the task or linked 2 or more elements in the task or mentioned the intention to perform an action .
<ICE-GB:W1A-016 #90:4>
Verbal protocols can take a employ heuristics such as Best-Bet means end or Ends-means <unclear-character> to complete a task where protocols either follow the best hypothesis for performing a t task or can starts at the end goal of the task and works backwards to the beginning of the task before performing it .

5
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #2:1>
<unclear-words> &lsquo; Emotion &rsquo; is a high state of arousal that is caused by and directed away from the individual into the exterior world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #3:1>
In this respect it differs from motivation which is categorized as being due to internal factors .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #4:1>
It also differs from motivation because it is invariably accompanied by some changes in the autonomic nervous system .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #5:1>
There are thought to be four componants components of emotion that in varying relationships and quantities cause our subjective experience of the emotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #6:1>
Firstly there is are the physiological changes , secondly one 's expression of an emotion , thirdly one 's cognitive appraisal of it and lastly one 's perception of the ass attitude to the assumed cause of the emotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #7:1>
Different theorists dispute the role and relative importance of these factors in our feeling an emotion 's intensity and our differentiation of emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #8:1>
The James-Lange theory stresses the importance of the physiological effects .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #9:1>
It was an in It is central to the study of emotions as it was one o an early theory ( in the nineteenth century ) from which others can work .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #10:1>
It is also of i stimulating because it is counter intuitive counter-intuitive as it hypothesizes that the physiological changes are the subjective emotional experience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #11:1>
That is to say For example we run and are therefore affraid afraid .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #12:1>
As I h said , this was a big stimulus to the field , but how does the theory stand and what evidence is there for it ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #13:1>
Firstly the physiological experience is part of the emotional experience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #14:1>
When one feels an emotion certain involuntary changes occur within us .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #15:1>
These include changes in salivation , breathing , heart rate , perspiration and muscle tone .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #16:1>
Furthermore evidence has been found t Furthermore there is evidence that supports these physiologi bodily changes as being essential to an emotional state .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #17:1>
This evidence involved testing patients with spine severs severances .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #18:1>
Some had no spine severs severances and then there were another five groups who had the severs severances in varying places along the spine .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #19:1>
Below a spine sever severance one cannot get any physiological feedback , so the higher the severe severance , the less feedback one gets .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #20:1>
The patients were interviewed and tested in a laboratory and results consistently showed that the higher the spine severe severance the less patients reported being able to &lsquo; feel &rsquo; an emotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #21:1>
They reported &lsquo; thinking &rsquo; an emotion , such as fear for example , but not actually <unclear-characters> &lsquo; feeling &rsquo; it as they had before .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #22:1>
Therefore physiological response does contribute to one 's subjective experience as it determines the intensity of the emotion , at least partly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #23:1>
James and Lange independently said that physiological variations changes did more than this &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #24:1>
they differentiate emotions as they are the cause of them .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #25:1>
emotio
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #26:1>
P.T.O .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #27:1>
Their model for this mechanism is as follows :
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #28:1>
The number by the arrows represents the order of the pathway causing emotion , with the cortex then hav lastly having the emotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #29:1>
Some evidence has been found to support this , in mainly in the field of facial expression .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #30:1>
When one reads exp A facial expression results in physiological changes and , arguably , to a change in emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #31:1>
This is supposed to be due to the change in muscles causing a change in the blood supply and the feel of the facial muscles being happ a pleasure or not .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #32:1>
Thus it is still argued that the physiological changes cause the subjective emotional experience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #33:1>
Hence if you smile , you will feel happy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #34:1>
The James-Lange theory has been strongly criticised , especially by Cannon .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #35:1>
He firstly said that two differing emotions may have the same accompanying physiological changes , so one cannot distinguish between emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #36:1>
However further research has been conducted on this that indicates this criticism may not be just .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #37:1>
Actors were trained to show one of six different facial expressions and their physiological variations monitered monitored .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #38:1>
Although two emotions , such as fear and love , may both produce an increase in breathing , fear reduced one 's temperature , while love caused an increase .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #39:1>
Thus the proportions and combinations of physiological responses may vary between emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #40:1>
However this study was limited as it only examined six emotions -
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #41:1>
it is dubious if there would be much physiological variation between pride and satisfaction for example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #42:1>
There are two other major criticisms of the theory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #43:1>
Firstly the physiological responses occur too slowly to cause the emotion , and therefore can not be the cause .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #44:1>
Secondly evidence has been found that shows one can have <unclear-character> the physiological <unclear-characters> changes without feeling the corresponding emotion one is supposed to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #45:1>
This was shown by using drugs , such that produce the physiological change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #46:1>
Thus physiological changes do not cause an emotional experience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #47:1>
However they do affect the intensity as they affect how w do determine how much we &lsquo; feel &rsquo; an emotion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #48:1>
The James-Lange theory was incorrect but did emphasize one vital encourage research in one of the vital areas of emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #49:2>
7A
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #50:2>
Conditioning is learning by association .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #51:2>
At some points it was considered the only form of learning by l - a theory the Behaviourists declared .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #52:2>
This has been criticised by many who would also emphasize the role of inherited factors through genetics and the importance of cognition in learning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #53:2>
However no one has denied that conditioning has some role in learning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #54:2>
It is therefore highly worthy of examination .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #55:2>
Conditioning takes two basic forms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #56:2>
Firstly there is &lsquo; Pavlovian Classical &rsquo; conditioning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #57:2>
In this one event becomes associated with another .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #58:2>
Pavlov first discovered this in his &lsquo; rule of drule &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #59:2>
He noticed that his dogs were salivating to the sound of a bell that indicated food would be arriving soon , rather than just to the arrival of soon food .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #60:2>
He further tested this phenomenon and fou clarified the three stages involved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #61:2>
- see below
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #62:2>
Stage 1 -
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #63:2>
Conditioned Stimulus ( eg bell )
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #64:2>
no Response ( before ) Unconditioned Stimulus ( eg food ) Response ( eg salivation )
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #65:2>
Stage 2 -
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #66:2>
C. S. ( bell ) + U. C. S. ( food ) &right-arrow; Response ( salivation ) ( acquisition )
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #67:2>
Stage 3 -
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #68:2>
U. C. S. ( food ) &right-arrow; resp Unconditioned Response ( after ) C. S. ( bell ) &right-arrow; Conditioned Response ( Salivation )
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #69:2>
Thus the dogs dogs ' behaviour had been changed because they associated the bell with the food .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #70:2>
This association is obviously central to the behaviour modification , and it's its success is primarily dependent on predictability .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #71:2>
So long as the animal believes the conditioned stimulus is predicting the unconditioned stimulus , it will respond .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #72:2>
This was shown by having two groups of dogs , one group who got shocks at a regular interval and one who got them eratically erratically .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #73:2>
Later when shocks were being associated with another stimulus the group who got regular shocks were conditioned while those who had eratic erratic shocks failed to be - as they had no notion of shocks predicting anything , but instead being eratic and irregular .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #74:2>
This phenomenon of conditioning extends beyond this physiological to involuntry involuntary actions , and also to psychology .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #75:2>
The best example of this is probably phobias where the principle of &lsquo; once bitten twice shy &rsquo; comes into play as people associate a bad event with something and so avoid l a situation and so avoid that situation again as it causes fear .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #76:2>
Thus conditioning applies to many areas , but it is also extensive in these areas as not only does one gets many forms of it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #77:2>
One gets excitatory conditioning where there is a pleasant unconditioned stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #78:2>
There is also &lsquo; aversive &rsquo; where there is an unpleasant unconditioned stimulus -
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #79:2>
from such an event a phobia may arise .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #80:2>
There is also negative conditioning where an aversive association may be terminated thus causing a change in behaviour due to a lack of association .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #81:2>
Also important is the ability to extinguish an association which is achieved by either ending the association or by associating the unconditioned stimulus with an a a different conditioned stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #82:2>
There are various other forms , such as pseudo-conditioning which all extend the influence of associative <unclear-word> classical conditioning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #83:2>
The other main form is operant conditioning which was first introduced by Thorndike and later developed by Skinner .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #84:2>
In this an animal learns that an action will be followed by a consequence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #85:2>
That is to say an operation by itself will cause reinforcement that will either increase the chances of l or reduce the chances of the animal repeating the operation in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #86:2>
This is evident from animals in a cage exploring their environment which includes a level lever .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #87:2>
Accidental pressing results in food being delivered .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #88:2>
Thus pressing the lever is associated with food and as food is desirable conse the animal will press the lever again .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #89:2>
What
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #90:2>
What is essential to this mechanism is for the animal to feel it is in control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #91:2>
This was shown by two groups of dogs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #92:2>
The first received food randomly regularly , and the second randomly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #93:2>
Later when pressing the lever was required to release food the first group learned and the second group failed to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #94:2>
as they
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #95:2>
Once again this phenomenon extends into many areas such as the involuntary actions ( such as vasoconstriction ) and psychological .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #96:2>
This is very apparant apparent in child <unclear-character> modification .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #97:2>
For example a young boy cried frequently and his parents comforted him .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #98:2>
His parents were then recormended recommended to stop comforting him as they were giving him positive reinforcement for undesirable behaviour .

When they did this his crying ceased .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #100:2>
Once again a
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #101:2>
As with classical conditioning , operant conditioning is extensive .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #102:2>
One can have negative reinforcement for exam to discourage a bad operation/behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #103:2>
This is less effective than positive reinforcement as no alternative behaviour is indicated .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #104:2>
It may also The &lsquo; punishment &rsquo; may also cause fear , resentment and anger , which maybe may be worse than the original problem .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #105:2>
Once again there is also negative conditioning and extinction .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #106:2>
These two principles can be used to account for so much behaviour because of two phenomenon phenomena .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #107:2>
Firstly there is generalization where for example because a dog one dog bit you once one is affraid afraid of all dogs .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #108:2>
Secondly the uncon conditioned stimulus can then take on the qualities of the unconditioned stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #109:2>
People are not all conditioned like robots though because there are a number of other variations that influence how effective an association is .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #110:2>
These include one 's arousal level , the intensity of the stimulus/response , the strength of the compatibleness of the stimuli or the response with the reinforcement , to name but a few .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #111:2>
Thus conditioning is extensive , and a main mode of learning .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #112:2>
Many dislike it because it denies our control .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #113:2>
However it is a phenomenon that largely contributes to learning , and may even over ride override any some genetic influences .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #114:3>

&lsquo; Motivation &rsquo; is the term used to describe our internal prompting of action that may be directed outside of us , but is not caused by things or events outside of us .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #116:3>
It thus energizes and directs our action .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #117:3>
Firstly it is not external as an external prompting is classified as an &lsquo; emotion &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #118:3>
Instead motivation occurs in essence without
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #119:3>
It is called a drive because a &lsquo; drive &rsquo; is a change in our voluntry voluntary behaviour to satisfy our motivations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #120:3>
It is of course worth noting that wh our motivations may also be energized in the form of a &lsquo; need &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #121:3>
This is an involuntary response .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #122:3>
For example , when one is cold , one 's blood capilleries capillaries close to minimise heat loss and one may start shivering .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #123:3>
Thus a &lsquo; motivation &rsquo; is more than just a &lsquo; drive &rsquo; as it also includes &lsquo; need induces &lsquo; needs &rsquo; that push us into action of action of a different sort .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #124:3>
External factors may also affect our motivations as they may cause a change in internal factors .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #125:3>
For example when the whether weather is cold , our internal temperature is changed and which may activate us to put on an extra item of clothing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #126:3>
However the
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #127:3>
This example illustrates a conce the concept of <unclear-word> &lsquo; homeostasis &rsquo; which is central to motivation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #128:3>
In this This shows that one is trying to maintain a constant internal environment in the face of a continued changing external environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #129:3>
This is particularly applicable to the basic survival motives of temperature control , hunger and thirst .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #130:3>
The other two main forms of motivation that people have in commen common with other animals are social ( inc. sex and maternal ) and curiosity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #131:3>
These are not believed to work on the homeostasis principle as there is no desirable internal constant to be kept to .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #132:3>
In primates and especially people other motivations feature , such a desire for &lsquo; self realization &rsquo; some would say .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #133:3>
For these to occur one 's physical survival is essential .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #134:3>
, so and as Social interactions will help this , as will curiosity , which helps one to better manipulate one 's environment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #135:3>
it is probably tha Thus survival , social and curiosity motives are the one 's ones that must be satisfied before any others .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #136:3>
What is debatable is whether one 's survi physical survival is the ends end , which are further motivations are just trying to secure , or whether they are the means that enable our further motivations .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #137:3>
These further motivations are more complex because they have less to do with our physical survival , and more to do with our minds .
<ICE-GB:W1A-017 #138:3>
Therefore external factors are going to feature have a larger role .

Commentary and Analysis

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #3:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #4:1>
&lsquo; They Are All Gone Into The World of Light &rsquo; is an extremley extremely passionate poem .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #5:1>
The speaker feels alone now that all his friends have departed in death and grieves that he cannot understand the mysteries of the glorious afterlife .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #6:1>
His frustration at this is evident throughout the poem and the speaker uses many techniques , consciously or unconsciously , to place his plea before God to show him the revelations of heaven or to take his spirit by death .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #7:1>
The opening sentence with its exclamation mark at the end , marks the onset of a passionate debate .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #8:1>
The speaker tells us of his monotonous life , now that his friends have departed ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X9:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #10:1>
The sense of death is prominent with the use of the word &lsquo; decay &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #11:1>
It is as if the man is giving up hope .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #12:1>
Indeed the few lines before the above quote suggest why .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #13:1>
The speaker still thinks of his lost friends &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #14:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #15:1>
The &lsquo; light &rsquo; seems to trouble him .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #16:1>
The idea of heaven weighs heavily on his mind .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #17:1>
With the repetition of &lsquo; My days &rsquo; in line 9 and 10 , we can feel the depresive depressive monotony that the speaker is sinking into .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #18:1>
The speaker wants to understand death ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #19:1>
his quest emotion for this quest is strongly emphasized when he invokes , &lsquo; Dear , beauteous death !
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X20:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #21:1>
The image presented here is powerful and extremely vivid .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #22:1>
His metaphor for death as a &lsquo; jewel &rsquo; shows how he yearns to unlock its mysteries .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #23:1>
The &lsquo; jewel &rsquo; however is one of the &lsquo; just &rsquo; which seems to suggest that death is only rewarded to good people .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #24:1>
Perhaps the speaker feels that he is suffering on earth for as he says , &lsquo; Alone I sit lingering here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #25:1>
It is a strange paradox to call death a &lsquo; shining &rsquo; &lsquo; jewel &rsquo; in the &lsquo; dark &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #26:1>
For how can it shine if there is no light .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #27:1>
This is an ambiguous line for the speaker opened his poem with , &lsquo; They are all gone into the world of light . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #28:1>
At the beginning death was seen as a light , now he seems to be praising it as a darkness .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #29:1>
However , perhaps in using the image of darkness the speaker is emphasising the fact that he is blind and ignorant when it comes to the glories of heaven .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #30:1>
His use of the word mystery exemplifies his feeling of awe &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #31:1>
he cannot comprehend the full meaning of death .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #32:1>
The sixth stanza follows on from this fith fifth one in a rather clever way .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #33:1>
It helps to clarify the poet 's ambigious ambiguous comments beforehand by giving an actual example of what he means .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #34:1>
As he says , a man may know if a bird has flown from its nest if he can see the nest , &lsquo; But What fair well or grove he sings in now That is to him unknown . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #35:1>
This reinforces the earlier statement , that man is blind to what he cannot see .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #36:1>
Yet it seems that the speaker had had some experience of what comes after death for , &lsquo; angels in some brighter dreams Call to the soul when man doth sleep , So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes And into glory peep . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #37:1>
Although this experience is very limited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #38:1>
This is undermined by the fact that the speaker varies the line length .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #39:1>
In line 27 , the line is hypermetric , and thus breaks out of the normal length , which could help to show the vastness of the &lsquo; strange thoughts &rsquo; transcended by angels .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #40:1>
The following line however is much shorter , and suggests to us the limited revelations we are allowed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #41:1>
Even a small understanding , like this , seems to enliven the speaker , for enjambement is used at the beginning of the quatrain and has the effect of suggesting that the speaker is running away with his thoughts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #42:1>
Indeed such a small glimpse of such mysteries does seem to set a spark aflame in the poet , for the next stanza , the eighth , follows on from the seventh by exemplifying the result of &lsquo; strange thoughts &rsquo; in &lsquo; brighter dreams &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #43:1>
The poet uses a good set of constructional devices .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #44:1>
He proposes to the reader a situation , what , &lsquo; if a star were confined into a tomb . &rsquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #45:1>
He then continues to explain what would happen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X46:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #47:1>
It is an ingenious device , for the star can represent the knowledge of glory , of celestial grace , and the tomb can represent the body or soul .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #48:1>
He parallels his situation to this example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #49:1>
By using such metaphors the frustration of his situation is brought to the foreground .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #50:1>
A small piece of divine knowledge is not enough ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #51:1>
it burns like a trapped star in his heart .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #52:1>
Such emotive language as this makes us as the reader feel pity for the speaker , it is as though he is trapped on this earth .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #53:1>
For he calls an invocation to God ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #54:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X55:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #56:1>
He wishes to be released from his body so he can rise to the heavens in glory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #57:1>
The enjambement in the first two for lines highlights that God is the creator of all things .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #58:1>
It also shows the speaker 's passion , as he quickly moves onto on to the next lines .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #59:1>
At the end of the poem the speaker gives an ultimatum to God . Which , which could at first seem rather ignorant , but when we realise the spiritual and mental physical torment which the man is going through his plea seems justified .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #60:1>
He asks God to &lsquo; disperse these mists , which blot and fill My perspective still as they pass &semi; Or else remove me hence unto that hill Where I shall need no glass &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #61:1>
It is a beautiful image which is presented here ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #62:1>
it is one of longing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #63:1>
The speaker will always look to heaven in the hope of understanding more , even though the lense lens is cloudy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #64:1>
The speaker uses various forms of arguments and examples to clarify his feelings of frustration and to help favour his plea to God , which is to grant him holy or divine knowledge , whether living or dead .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #65:1>
The form of the poem is set out well , and its structure is one which takes us step by step through the speaker 's argument .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #66:1>
First we are told of his position in life , then of his hope , then his frustration leading eventually to his invocation to the Lord .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #67:1>
The poem can almost be seen as a form of prayer , an asking for mercy to be granted , mercy in death .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #68:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #71:2>
At the beginning of the passage , the attitude and tone of the narrator is rather difficult to distinguish .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #72:2>
He sets up a distinct contrast between English universities and s and the most &lsquo; celebrated &rsquo; ones of &lsquo; Holland , Germany and Italy &rsquo; &semi; showing the busy <unclear-word> and youthful appearances of the foreign universities in contrast to the &lsquo; apparent order and tranquility that prevail s prevail in the seats of the English Muses . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #73:2>
In such colleges as Oxford and Cambridge there is a sense of unity in , &lsquo; the uniform habit of the academics , &rsquo; and a strict order is prevalent for , &lsquo; the stated hours of the hall and chapel represent the discipline of a regular , and as it were religious community . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #74:2>
In the other universities abroard abroad the students are shown to have more life within them ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #75:2>
they , &lsquo; swarm from different countries , are loosely dispersed in private lodgings ...
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #76:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #77:2>
In such places as these there is no &lsquo; square cap &rsquo; or &lsquo; black gown . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #78:2>
The students are actually youths not simply &lsquo; academics &rsquo; , as the author calls English students .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #79:2>
He shows the vitality of the foreign universities by discussing the , &lsquo; intemperate quarrels of youth and wine &rsquo; .. in which &lsquo; their swords &rsquo; are sometimes used .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #80:2>
In the English universities there is no such life ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #81:2>
the &lsquo; use of arms is banished &rsquo; and the whole picture is one of , &lsquo; apparent order and tranquility &rsquo; so that the colleges &lsquo; appear &rsquo; to , &lsquo; be so many palaces which a liberal nation has erected and endowed for the habitation of science . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #82:2>
It is only by the end of the passage that we are able to decipher what the author is trying to achieve in his first paragraph , by contrasting the lively foreign colleges with the rather stately and demure English ones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #83:2>
We realise by line sixty five that the author is not praising the orderly life of Oxford College , for as he says &lsquo; To the University of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation ...
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #84:2>
I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College :
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #85:2>
they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #86:2>
Further on he gives a reason for this ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #87:2>
it was a lack of good guidance and teaching .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #88:2>
He looks back to the past and tells us that , &lsquo; even my childish reading had displayed an early though blind propensity for books : and the shallow flood might have been taught to flow in a deep channel and a clear stream .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X89:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #90:2>
However his account of Oxford University does not seem to hold any bitterness .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #91:2>
There is certainly a touch of regret which we can sense strongly in the moving image of the flood turning to a clear stream .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #92:2>
It acts as a metaphor representing his early awakening for literature which could have been chanelled channelled into something better had he been taught how ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #93:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #94:2>
Although regret is displayed it is not self pitying , for the author seems to have realised why he had to leave Oxford .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #95:2>
If he had been taught by &lsquo; vigilant professors &rsquo; as he says , &lsquo; the wanderings of fancy would have been restrained , and I should have escaped the temptations of idleness . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #96:2>
The author seems to look on the past with a kind of maturity ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #97:2>
he does not expect to be excused by other people for his failure , but he wishes to explain himself nonetheless .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #98:2>
The author knows that he will be rebuked by the reader for we as he says , we &lsquo; The reader will pronounce between the school and the scholar . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #99:2>
Yet he defends himself with dignity and reserve .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #100:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #101:2>
When he quotes from Bishop Lowth who was educated at the University of Oxford and enjoyed , &lsquo; a well-regulated course of useful discipline and studies . , &rsquo; the author does not rebuke him or attack him for having such sentiments about Oxford but praises him ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #102:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #103:2>
Yet by praising him , the author subtly manages to degrade him slightly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #104:2>
As the reader , we question whether Bishop Lowth is telling the truth , or is it all false and &lsquo; imaginary &rsquo; as the author politely suggests ?
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #105:2>
Indeed what Lowth seems to say about the College seems contradicts what the author says .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #106:2>
The Bishop believes that there was were &lsquo; skilful and vigilant professors . &rsquo; who , &lsquo; encouraged , and pushed forward by example , by commendation , and by authority . , &rsquo; the thoughts of the scholars .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #107:2>
The author 's experience however was the exact opposite .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #108:2>
For this reason we can also question the truth of what the author says .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #109:2>
He certainly writes in an aimiable amiable fashion , and acts as the humble man , who has learnt from his lessons in life .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #110:2>
He presents his feelings to us which creates help establish a bond between author and reader and ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #111:2>
therefore we are inclined to side with his opinion .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #112:2>
The order of the English Universities and the strict discipline that resides there is all a mask for it is &lsquo; apparent order &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #113:2>
The author seems to comend commend those colleges which show more life , for perhaps underneath they are the more hardworking .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #114:2>
He presents us with a lesson to learn , that looks can be decieving deceiving .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #115:2>
I believe that his attitude is one of complacency .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #116:2>
He realises his mistakes that he made , and reflects with maturity on his past University days , not wishing to change anything , but satisfied that he has had his say in defence of his youth !
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #117:3>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #118:3>
Browning once said that poetry was &lsquo; the putting of the infinite into the finite &rsquo; and , as such , he saw language as a barrier to expression .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #119:3>
I think that this poem justifies his point .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #120:3>
The poem is poet expresses poem is essentially about a the poet 's longing to escape this his present existence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #121:3>
<unclear-word> The poet presents himself in the first stanza in the typical state of lonely isolation expressed in poems as far back as , for example , <unclear-character> the &lsquo; Dream of the Rood &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #122:3>
The poet laments the loss of relatives and friends and his <unclear-word> unhappy existence .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #123:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #124:3>
<unclear-words> His memory of his lost friends grows into a hope of recovery from his sad situation <unclear-words> inducing a juxtaposition between his memory which is &lsquo; fair and bright ... like stars &rsquo; and the &lsquo; faint beams &rsquo; , &lsquo; cloudy breast &rsquo; and &lsquo; gloomy grove &rsquo; which represent the poet 's nebulous state of mind/heart .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #125:3>
The poet 's life is described as &lsquo; dull and hoary &rsquo; , &lsquo; Mere glimmering and decays &rsquo; when in which the heavy consonantal sounds are used to convey the downbeat existence the poet leads .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #126:3>
These contrast with the aspirate sounds conveying his hope .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #127:3>
So , in his assumed hope , the poet looks to an onward movement from this life to the next .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #128:3>
The break in the poem marks the ongoing process of the poet 's thought process where the first four stanzas witness his awakening to hope and the final six mark his contemplation of death as a means of escape .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #129:3>
At first he questions death , comparing it to a bird whose destination is unknown .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #130:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #131:3>
So he questions , &lsquo; What mysteries do lie beyou beyond thy dust &rsquo; recalling the Biblical words &lsquo; into dust thou shalt return &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #132:3>
The poem <unclear-word> is ultimately an expression of Christian sentiment in that the poet is <unclear-words> does not regard death as something bad .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #133:3>
In fact , he addresses it as in praiseworthy although rather clich&eacute;d tem terms .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #X134:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #135:3>
Here the heavy consonantal sounds are used as a means of emphasized exultation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #136:3>
Yet , the words &lsquo; jewel of the just &rsquo; promote the then Christian ideal that only those who have led good lives will attain their place in glory so that death is only a &lsquo; jewel &rsquo; to those who feel assured of that place .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #137:3>
The poet clearly has no qualms in this respect .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #138:3>
In fact , he compares himself to a &lsquo; star ... confined in a tomb &rsquo; who needs to be released .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #139:3>
Death is a means of release to the poet .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #140:3>
The last two stanzas come in the form of a prayer to God asking him for the liberty of death or to &lsquo; disperse these mists &rsquo; , that is , the <unclear-character> unhappiness of his present situation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #141:3>
The poem is progressive in that it follows the spiritual of the awakening of the poet from his downbeat state of mind at the beginning to his resolute resolve at the end &semi; his determination made clear by the imperatives he uses in his prayer to God : &lsquo; disperse &rsquo; , &lsquo; remove &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #142:3>
I said at the beginning that I thought this poem justified Browning 's conception of language and poetic form as a barrier to the <unclear-word> conveyance of mental expression and feeling .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #143:3>
, the subject matter of the poem is highly unoriginal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #144:3>
Not only this , the poet 's language is clich&eacute;d and unoriginal and his means of conveyance of thought , the idea of hope as a star , death as a jewel , the flight of the bird , angels in dreams , hope as a kindling factor ( l. 15/16 ) <unclear-word> make the reader cringe in their repetition of concepts <unclear-character> produced in countless writing .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #145:3>
Finally , the telescope as a medium of for perception and vision beyond that of the earth and therefore Man 's state is a traditional symbol .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #146:3>
The poet expresses nothing new .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #147:3>
The sorrow/unhappiness of the poet is no poet is unrealized because of this .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #148:3>
He uses a ballad-like form of verse which does not stay well with and the simple and most common ABAB rhymimg scheme which promotes a sing-song complacent too effect which surely does not tie in with the sentiment expressed , particularly in the first half of the poem .
<ICE-GB:W1A-018 #149:3>
The title of the poem seems to miss the point of the piece itself since thou although the fact that his the poet 's friends are dead has resulted in his desolation , the poem becomes a personal awakening so that the title is only really relevant to the first stanza .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #1:1>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #2:1>
A+B
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #3:1>
Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko were both working in the post war period and both have very different methods of working , although <unclear-word> their ideas were of similar nature .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #4:1>
They both worked on very large canvases , almost in the form of a mural size , Pollock being influenced by the Mexican muralist artists , Siquerious and Orozoco .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #5:1>
Rothko believed , <unclear-words> to work on a painting larger than one 's self enabled you to become apart a part of that painting and be more directly involved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #6:1>
Here we <unclear-word> have Pollock 's &ldquo; Summertime &rdquo; painting , and the size of the painting is
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #7:1>
although there is no direct subject matter , the size of the canvas could resemble the vastness of the American landscape .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #8:1>
It is one of Pollock 's famous &ldquo; drip &rdquo; paintings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #9:1>
He used the unconventional methods of applying paint by using the de drip method - using dryed dried up paint brushings , squeezing the paint directly from the tube , and pouring directly from cans of paint and basting syringes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #10:1>
He used also used unconventional method paints for example enamal enamel and industrial paints .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #11:1>
There is very limited colour and the and the intricate pattern of lines , powerfully give the painting emotion and a fast fluidity of speed .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #12:1>
Pollock 's method was a highly controlled technique , even though some of the marks , <unclear-word> appear are quite accidental and are by chance .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #13:1>
Both Rothko and Pollock used J. P. Sato J. P. Satire 's Sartre 's existentialist thesis of &ldquo; being is doing &rdquo; . Both , both individually creating and ( apparently ) alienated from society .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #14:1>
Also they both rejected Freud 's physic psychic reality and pictorial principal principle and adopted the ideas of C. Jung , being both working spontaneously and unconciously unconsciously subjectively .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #15:1>
Rothko 's painting is not so much about the gestural marks , as in Pollocks Pollock 's ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #16:1>
it is the effect of a whole &ldquo; colour field &rdquo; , meaning that their there are no no <unclear-characters> definate definite gestural marks , just areas of intense saturated colour .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #17:1>
Critic 's Critics of a during the post war period , for example , Clement Greenberg , associated this l new avant-garde art with past historical references the and did not feel they were working entirely unconscously unconsciously ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #18:1>
for example , Pollock had come from West America where the paint American Indians were situated and he Greenberg believed that this undoubtedly had an effect of on Pollock 's work , especially his early work , for example &ldquo; Birth &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #19:1>
He saw a There were influences clearly shown eg. the use of the Totem pole and a violent and expressive use of symbols .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #20:1>
Both artists were creating freely without economic pressures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #21:1>
<unclear-words> Pollock was a part of the Federal Works Project - a project set up under Roosevelt 's new deal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #22:1>
Politicians were now realizing America was one of the most economically sound countries , to for eg in weapons and that the art world could was at its pinacle pinnacle of social idealism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #23:1>
However communism was always and a threat but a shoft shift from left to Right , Demarxification , was happening .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #24:1>
But Critics still dispute the effect that the cold war had on the art culture , whether it did or not ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #25:1>
even so America had to come out of its isolationism to become a strong economic country in the art world .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #26:2>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #27:2>
C+D
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #28:2>
Here we have one of Andy Warhol 's famous <unclear-words> &ldquo; Marylin &rdquo; &ldquo; Marilyn &rdquo; paintings and l one of Richard Hamilton 's famous &ldquo; Interiors &rdquo; series .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #29:2>
Both Artist 's Artists had go come through the depre depression of the 20's and 30's in America and were heavily influenced by the mass reproductive media .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #30:2>
N There was still a hangover from the 40's , but what was unique about the 50's and 60's was the vast acceptance of mass luxury items and the <unclear-words> acceptance of change .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #31:2>
The mass paraphernalia , for example , fridges , freezers , automobiles , the woman image , advertizing , films , and magazines and newspapers g influence Warhol and Hamilton , but both quite in different ways .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #32:2>
Throughout the Sixties Warhol became came to be known as more of a celebrity than an artist ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #33:2>
people <unclear-words> were more concerned about seeing him than his art ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #34:2>
he was known slowly adapt acquired titles such as &ldquo; the Campbell soup man with white hair &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #35:2>
His reptilian features were fasinating fascinating to the public .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #36:2>
However at first Andy Warhol was very much an underground artist and ownly only the &ldquo; elite intelligensia intelligentsia &rdquo; would get to see him and his work , and in Public public interviews he would speak in a monotone cre voices with predominantly answers of &ldquo; yes &rdquo; and &ldquo; no &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #37:2>
The majority of Warhol 's work is using the silk screening method and both colour and image were important to him .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #38:2>
Warhol often used famous celebrat<del>yt</del>ies celebrities , as here Marylin Marilyn , and the colours would often change the mood and emotion of the celebraty celebrity , .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #39:2>
Here on the on the left left Marylin is brightly Warhol has used Brightly brightly illuminecant luminescent colours , maybe to display Marylin 's Marilyn 's public side of her nature , ie , what the public sees .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #40:2>
And on the right Marylin Marilyn is printed in black and white and the images gradually fade , maybe showing the hidden darker side of Marylin Marilyn , ie what the public do not see .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #41:2>
The Marylin 's Marilyns on the <unclear-word> left are much stronger and bold and are very positive images .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #42:2>
W Warhol constantly repeated images .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #43:2>
Warhol was very much influenced by the press newspaper articles and magazines .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #44:2>
During the 50's <unclear-word> and 60's products and images were highly glamorized and mass produced .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #45:2>
Publicity was everywhere .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #46:2>
Warhol , unlike the previous Abstract Expressionist movement , bravely go printed the direct image but still left room for the viewer to put his/her <unclear-character> own doca views or ideas behind it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #47:2>
<unclear-word> Richard Hamilton , a British pop progenitor , unlike Warhol , <unclear-words> from and working in America .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #48:2>
Hamilton showed in his work his acceptance and assurance of mass reproductive media .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #49:2>
<unclear-words> His &ldquo; Interior &rdquo; series a prime example .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #50:2>
Hamilton had began begun examining the image of the women .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #51:2>
<unclear-words> Hamilton adopted the ad-man 's image of the woman , not the fine-art 's image .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #52:2>
<unclear-words> For example , the woman being sexy , voluptuas voluptuous , in the home not at work .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #53:2>
In the advertizing world , the woman was pre portrayed in a film-set type room and she would be gazing out slightly .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #54:2>
Hamilton constructed his own image using collage and paint .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #55:2>
Hamilton 's information of American paraphernalia was second hand until his first visit to America in 1963 October .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #56:2>
Hamilton occassionaly occasionally made references to other painters in his work , as we see here , for example , in the bottom right hand corner .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #57:2>
Both Hamilton and Warhol were both highly influence influenced by the mass reproductive media .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #58:2>
However critics <unclear-words> felt that this mass merchanization mechanisation would arase erase genuine culture and have undermined the uniqueness of art .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #59:2>
Critics argued that pop art was not fine art .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #60:2>
However referring to Hamilton 's <unclear-character> of &ldquo; What Pop art is &rdquo; - expendibility expendability seems to be the only one not comp comendable commendable to fine art : - Bouchers
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #61:2>
Boucher 's work was sexy ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #62:2>
Hogarth and Duchamp were witty .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #63:2>
The validity of Warhol 's Warhol and Hamilton was controversial to many critics , arguing whether the use of direct materials of the media was actually their own work .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #64:2>
Hamilton and Warhol manipulated what the they saw and used it to their own benefits .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #65:3>
Question 1
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #66:3>
e+f
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #67:3>
Kitaj was of Jewish origin but is still considered a part of the &ldquo; London School &rdquo; of painters as he was working in London .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #68:3>
Anslem Anselm Kiefer is a contemporary German artist .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #69:3>
Kitaj , a figurative painter , .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #70:3>
in this picture it is obviously a London street but the figures he as has used an are from his Jewish background .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #71:3>
Kitaj is himself is actually in the picture ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #72:3>
he is the figure lying on the chair in the immediate foreground .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #73:3>
Kitaj uses very gestural marks and predominantly powerful primary colours .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #74:3>
A sweeping brushstroke movement <unclear-words> is clearly seem obvious .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #75:3>
Kitaj 's work differs immensely to from his fellow &ldquo; London School &rdquo; painters , for example Auerbach , Freud , Kossoff and Michael Andrews .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #76:3>
His Kitaj 's colours vibrant , his fellows fellows ' more subdued .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #77:3>
Anslem Anselm Kiefer , one of the young German artists to be born after the effects of the war , predominantly makes references to the pre war pre-war nazi rallies and the execution of Jews .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #78:3>
He uses In this particular example , we see a vast left space with a bloodshed - spear shaped form fairly central and <unclear-characters> German words , and ( a sentence along the bottom and on the window ) all refering referring to pre German pre-German historical happenings .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #79:3>
The colours very sombre and moody , apart from the only light of the window , the gestural black lines of the wood grain powerfully creating a mamoth mammoth space .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #80:3>
Kiefer 's paintings are incredibly large , enabling the viewer to be totally enveloped by the picture painting space , Getting getting the full emotion and power of the painting .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #81:4>
Question 4
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #82:4>
Critics of of the Pop Era were wrong to describe Pop art as fine art .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #83:4>
Referring to Hamilton 's famous list of &ldquo; what Pop art is &rdquo; , Michaelangelo Michelangelo was hailed as a genius at the moment of unveiling , <unclear-word> Boucher was &ldquo; sexy &rdquo; , Duchamp <unclear-word> and Hogarth were witty .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #84:4>
In the <unclear-word> history of painting the &ldquo; debris &rdquo; of the world has left <unclear-character> its mark on the art culture , for example Titian 's Venus of Urbino , Goyas Goya 's Majas and Velazquez 's &ldquo; Rokeby Venus &rdquo; were all considered at their time contemporary pornography .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #85:4>
Since the invention of the camera and film , the glamorization of mass reproduced media has immensely grown and has influenced many artists in both America and Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #86:4>
During the 50's and 60's everything was to be designed by the special look of things .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #87:4>
The mass paraphernalia The advertizing of mass paraphernalia &semi; : for example , fridges , freezers , the woman at home , was to be mass produced everywhere .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #88:4>
The glamorization of these products had to have the desirability to that of a Hollywood star .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #89:4>
The Pop Artists were not naive towards the commercialization of the mass media , some of them working for reproductive companies for example -
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #90:4>
Warhol was designing shoes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #91:4>
Artists during this era <unclear-word> used <unclear-word> mass paraphernalia in their work , in different ways and a was a complete change to the gestural , apparently unconciously unconsciously executed , of the Abstract Expressionists .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #92:4>
Critics argued <unclear-character> about the validity of using direct images in their work ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #93:4>
ie was it their own work .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #94:4>
<unclear-words> the Pop artists manipulated the images they chose and then artistically used it them to their own benefits .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #95:4>
However it is the artist working for his own private gratification , but also towards an audience .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #96:4>
Richard Hamilton , one of the British progenitors of Pop art ' , first influences and acceptance of the reproductive mass media was his involvement in the <unclear-word> Independent Group , develop a group of young artists from the ICA , met a and discussed ideas and techniques of mass media .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #97:4>
One of the first talks being was given by Paolozzi called &ldquo; Bunk &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #98:4>
Hamilton was directly involved with &ldquo; Man , Machine and Motion &rdquo; Exhibition at the a ICA .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #99:4>
It displayed photographs of machinary machinery in reality as well as fantasy .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #100:4>
No sooner was this exhibition over , &ldquo; This is Tomorrow &rdquo; Exhibition was opened , in which Hamilton made a special collage &ldquo; So what is it today that makes our homes so different so appealing . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #101:4>
It showed an interior environment , a comic displayed as a painting on the wall , pin-up imagry imagery , a tin of Ham ham displayed as sculpture and actually used the word &ldquo; Pop &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #102:4>
&ldquo; This is Tomorrow Exhibition &rdquo; was concerned with environments ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #103:4>
artists were working together with architects architects , engineers and designers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #104:4>
Not like the idea of the precious historical individualism idea of working unconciously unconsciously and on your own .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #105:4>
Hamilton began to show complete awareness of the mass reproductive media .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #106:4>
He began examining the ad-man 's and adopting the ad-man 's image of women , not the fine art view of a woman .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #107:4>
&ldquo; A woman 's place is in the home &rdquo; theory .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #108:4>
it is &ldquo; She &rdquo; and &ldquo; Hers is a lush situation &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #109:4>
prime examples -
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #110:4>
the use of magazines , for eg voluptua 's voluptuous lips and the automible automobile , with the p use of paint create a mechanamorphic mechanomorphic sexual image , the fleshing fleshniness fleshiness of the car and partnered with the women admiring it .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #111:4>
<unclear-words> Together with these paintings and another &ldquo; Homage a Chrysler Corp &rdquo; ( use of Crhysler 's Chrysler 's Cadillac ad ) they are all examples of what Hamilton 's idea of what Pop art is .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #112:4>
Hamilton 's use of advertising can be more clearly seen in his Romantic &ldquo; Soft and blue &rdquo; landscape paintings taken directly from the andrex Andrex toilet paper advertisements .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #113:4>
They are pap painted with Super realism .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #114:4>
As well as Hamilton approaching and being influence influenced by the mass media , he was approached by a company called LUX , th ( dealt with Hifi amplifier equipment ) to incorparate incorporate a sculptural pieces of art with one of these Hifi amplifier 's amplifiers .
<ICE-GB:W1A-019 #115:4>
Hamilton 's influences of American culture were second hand until his first visit to America in 1963 .

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #X2:1>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #3:1>
The way-up criteria is a phenonomen phenomenon used to establish the which way the rocks were originally deposited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #4:1>
It uses the Law of Superposition , which states that younger rocks are laid down after older rocks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #5:1>
Therefore in conjunction with the law of horizontallity horizontality ( ie all sedimentary rocks are generally deposited horizontally ) rocks young upwards .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #6:1>
In the sedimentary rocks there are many features which may be present to decide the way-up of a rock .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #7:1>
Bedding is a characteristic feature to sedimentary rocks , and due to the different patterns of sedimentation , the dire orientation in which it was deposited can be seen .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #8:1>
In aeolian environments the sand is blown until it accumulates , which can take on various features eg barcans barchans etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #9:1>
However it generally is deposited as dune bedding which in a lithostratic sequence gives a pattern as in FIG I .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #10:1>
Fluvial , and marine environments also give rise to characteristic bedding such as cross bedding and current bedding FIG 2 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #11:1>
Furthermore such features as deltas , formed by the varying effects on the estuary give rise to top , fore and bottom sets which show way-up .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #12:1>
On trucation truncation of these which occurs when a river is reguvinated rejuvenated etc. , then many of these may build up FIG 3 .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #13:1>
Similarly a sabka cycle gives away the way-up of the rocks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #14:1>
Sedimentary rocks also show various grading depending on how they have been deposited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #15:1>
If they have been transported fairly long distances before deposition , sorting occurs within the material .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #16:1>
This results in graded bedding , and it is accepted that the bed larger clasts etc are deposited first with the finer sediment on top . eg
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #17:1>
Other structures give rise to way-up being established .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #18:1>
They are generally less obvious
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #19:1>
however they give an a definate definite orientation of the way-up .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #20:1>
These include washouts which are sole marks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #21:1>
These have occured occurred where a small channel has been eroded into a fine sediment , then dried up leaving the above rocks to be deposited within the channal channel .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #22:1>
Groove casts and flute marks are formed in a similar way , where pebbles etc have eroded the stream bed and left &lsquo; holes &rsquo; or &lsquo; scratch marks &rsquo; which become infilled by above later deposits .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #23:1>
These structure structures may be found as indentations , but are generally found as to protrude from the rock .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #24:1>
This happens because the later deposited material is more resitant resistant to erosion than old the older rock .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #25:1>
Way-up is also decided by trace marks such as foot prints etc , although is more rare .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #26:1>
Furthermore the movement of calm rivers etc results in the production of ripple marks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #27:1>
These may be symmetrical or asymmetrical depending on the tidal movement .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #28:1>
rocks also produce dessication cracks , which are a result of a &lsquo; wet &rsquo; sediment layer drying , resulting in contraction and hence producing cracks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #29:1>
These cracks are infilled by finer sediments , which are deposited at a later date .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #30:1>
The cracks indicate way-up as they thin downwards .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #31:1>
Fossil filling also indicate indicates way up as when the insides eventually decompose , they may become partly filled with sediment .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #32:1>
Volcanic rocks produce way-up features due to there their content and on deposition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #33:1>
Lava flows <unclear-word> generally contain many air bubbles known as vesicles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #34:1>
In acidic rocks this is known as pumice and in basic it is known as scourie .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #35:1>
The size of the vesicles give rise to way up as the large vesicles form near the top of the flow with the small vesicles at the bottom .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #36:1>
These may become infilled with various minerals and are then known as amygdales .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #37:1>
Pillow lavas also give rise to way up as the they generate a cusp like feature due to compact and over burden of their own weight .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #38:1>
Furthermore unconformities can be used to find way-up structures as they can indicate which rocks are included in which . eg A non-conformity
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #39:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #X40:2>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #41:2>
Igneous rocks are either formed as extrusive or intrusive features .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #42:2>
Intrusive igneous rocks include such formations as sills .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #43:2>
These are generally concordant to the rocks .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #44:2>
( However on distinguishing between sills ands and lava flows sills may transgress the bedding planes ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #45:2>
Sills generally form along bedding planes , and may extend for many miles .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #46:2>
Therefore on erosion of the rocks after uplift and the various processes of denudation resulting in the topography , the sill may be exposed as a linear feature .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #47:2>
It may also be exposed as a wide plane .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #48:2>
However this is rare as generally rocks are deformed after deposition and rarely remain horizontal .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #49:2>
Dykes are another igneous intrusion which generally form from sills .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #50:2>
They are a vertical , discordant feature which cut across the bedding planes .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #51:2>
Therefore on a horizontal plane they are linear features at practically 90&degree; to the surface .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #52:2>
Dykes may originate from an intrusive complex resulting in dyke swarms ( many dykes ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #53:2>
Depending on the exposure of the topography and the dip of rocks , the appearence appearance of such intruded features will vary .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #54:2>
ie If the dip is the same direction as a slope but to a greater extent then :
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #55:2>
i
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #56:2>
However if the dip of the intrusion is less than the slope ii will occur
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #57:2>
ie there will be a greater width in the outcrop .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #58:2>
Furthermore the width/thickness of the intrusion will have a an effect on how the appearence appearance will change on a map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #59:2>
Therefore relief , thickness and the angle of dip all reflect the final image of the igneous feature on a map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #60:2>
Other structural igneous rock forms include batholiths , which produce stocks and bosses ( smaller scale versions of the batholith ) .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #61:2>
This is generally a discordant feature as it intrudes randomly into the country rock .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #62:2>
Such large scale features result in metamorphism due to the intense heating and , hence after erosion etc , result in a change of the lithological rock units on the map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #63:2>
A batholith occurs as an irregular feature on the map .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #64:2>
It does not fit in with any of the general lineations produce produced by sedimentary rocks
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #65:2>
eg
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #66:2>
The igneous intrusion will also have horizontal bedding , wheras whereas the surrounding rocks will have various dips etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #67:2>
Volcanoes and vents also have a similar appearence appearance as they too irrupt irregularly amongst other rock units .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #68:2>
However these produce external igneous rocks , such as lava flows and ignumbrives etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #69:2>
Therefore these features will/may result in extended igneous rock surfaces represented on the map , and furthermore are more likely to have a varying dip angle in accordance to this .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #70:2>
Loppoliths Lopoliths and laccoliths may also produce wide range features or linear features depending upon relief , dip and thickness etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #71:3>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #72:3>
Breaks in the stratigraphical lithologies of rock beds are either known as Diastems ( small scale features such as bedding planes ) , or unconformities which are long term breaks in the process of deposition .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #73:3>
Unconformities are produced by either the rocks of a sequence not being deposited or the rocks have been deposited , but were eroded away before a later series of rocks were deposited .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #74:3>
The features of unconformities vary and hence environments or the changing conditions/orientations may be worked out from thier their differing structures .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #75:3>
One of the most common types of unconformity is the angular conformity unconformity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #76:3>
Those occur where rocks have been deposited horizontally , then deposition has stoped stopped .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #77:3>
Tectonic forces have then resulted in the movement - of the rocks rock 's position ( after processes of lithification etc ) so that the rock sequence is at an angle to the horizon .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #78:3>
Erosion may then have followed , wearing away the rock to a &lsquo; flat &rsquo; plane .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #79:3>
After which sedimentation has followed resulting in horizontal sediments being deposited on angular angled rock beds .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #80:3>
A classic example of an angular unconformity is that discovered by and named after James Hutton . ie Huttons Hutton 's unconformity on the Northern Coast of the Isle of Arran .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #81:3>
This feature is composed of Dalradian Schist being deposited , lithified , moved and eroded . , then followed by deposition of carbonate carbonated sandstone .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #82:3>
A non-conformity is similar to an angular unconformity ,
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #83:3>
however it displays an erosive face between the two rock units .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #84:3>
This type is generally the easiest to detect and the change of environment may be worked out from the erosive surface eg glacial , aeolian , fluvial , marine conditions etc .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #85:3>
A non-conformity may include rock clasts eroded from the lower rock unit to be included in the upper rock unit . eg :
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #86:3>
A non-conformity is not necessarily angular and therefore is detected singly by the erosive surfaces , and the inclusion of such rock clasts .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #87:3>
There are two other common unconformities which are Parallel and Para unconformities .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #88:3>
The difference between these is the presence of an erosive face or slight change in angle in the Para unconformity .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #89:3>
However both types have rock beds above and below the unconformity surface of similar orientation .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #90:3>
These types of unconformity may be more difficult to recognise particularly in the upper rock which lies unconformably on the lower rock is of the same type of sediment material .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #91:3>
Therefore an unconformity is to be found in the bottom of a rock unit and can be identified by the varying dip or erosive nature between the two beds .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #92:3>
However if this does not provide a good enough identifiable structure , then methods such as radioactive dating can be used to show the differences in age of two rock units .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #93:3>
Furthermore biostratigraphy can be used if the rock contains certain fossil zones which are known to have existed
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #94:3>
eg The European Jurrasic Jurassic containing 20 ammonoid zones .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #95:3>
Similarly the gastropods can be used to help dating and correlation in the lower Paleozoic .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #96:4>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #X97:4>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #98:4>
The outcrop pattern of folded rocks can firstly be affected by their thickness which in turn is affected by the topography .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #99:4>
If an outcrop of a syncline/anticline occurs on a horizontal face then the outcrop pattern will be wider than the thickness of the fold strata . eg
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #100:4>
In both case cases the width ( w ) is greater than the thickness of the rock bed ( t )
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #101:4>
However if the folds where were to occur on a slope face then the topography results in a different outcrop .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #102:4>
If the limb has a dip greater than the dip of the slope , then the width of the outcrop is greater than the thickness of the rock by only a small amount .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #103:4>
If however the dip of the limb is less than the dip of the slope , then the outcrop width is much greater than the thickness .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #104:4>
The effect of outcrop on a slope can be produced on a map which results in various widths from the different angles of dip , even though the thickness of the outcrop may be the same eg
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #105:4>
Outcrop pattern is not only affected by slopes but by river valleys which produce different feature features depending on the angle of dip and the direction of dip with reguard regard to the valley and the valley walls .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #106:4>
A rock dipping up stream at a high angle would produce a very wide V shaped outcrop A .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #107:4>
However if the dip was less than the slope of the valley walls it would produce a V wider than the valley but less wide than a steeply dipping rock
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #108:4>
eg B .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #109:4>
If however the limb of a fold dipped at a shallow gradient down-stream the V becomes much narrower ie less than the valley contours C .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #110:4>
Although with a limb dipping at a high angle downstream the V is inverted the other way round and is broad as in the case of the high dipping rock up stream .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #111:4>
D .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #112:5>

<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #113:5>
Folds are formed from horizontally deposited rock layers which under forces of compression become compacted and as a result fold to form structures which require less surface area .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #114:5>
Folding occurs in the upper crust ( lithosphere ) as the rock structure needs to be preserved .
<ICE-GB:W1A-020 #115:5>
However it may extend into the lower crust as in the case of deep seated isoclinal folds etc .

<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #1:1>
Dear Matthew ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #2:1>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #3:1>
Are you still living a life of pure debauchery in that paradise - - Nanterre ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #4:1>
You 're no doubt working extremely hard .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #5:1>
avoiding the things you dislike and doing the things you do best .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #6:1>
Rest .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #7:1>
How do I find you this day ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #8:1>
Do I see you wide awake , reading this letter whilst dashing across campus on your way to an excillarating exhilarating lecture . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #9:1>
I can't be sure ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #10:1>
can I ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #11:1>
To be sure , I can't be sure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #12:1>
More likely I find you in room-without-a-view , batiment C , second floor at the end of the corridor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #13:1>
You 're lying down , probably beneath a line of dripping wet clothing , the radio on ( BBC of course ) , and underneath and around you lies ... God only knows what !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #14:1>
I don't mean to sound religious , God forbid no !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #15:1>
No , no more of this conjecture ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #16:1>
you 're well I know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #17:1>
I hope - your you 're finding time for yourself , you extra-extroverted socialite , you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #18:1>
How are the wonderful people at Nanterre ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #19:1>
I 'm not one for gossip but do write and tell me - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #20:1>
tell me everything .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #21:1>
On a more humorous note , how are your studies ( dissertation ) coming along ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #22:1>
nicely I trust .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #23:1>
And how is your job-finding , found one yet ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #24:1>
Here in wonderful London , the sun shines , the birds sing and the streets are still paved with gold .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #25:1>
Mr &lsquo; Major &rsquo; is having major difficulties at the moment isn't s/he .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #26:1>
Apparently he dithers ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #27:1>
hardly surprising being a politician is it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #28:1>
Life goes on Matthew doesn't it regardless of the turmoil we often find ourselves embroiled in .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #29:1>
We do only what we can do , given the circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #30:1>
Keep it down to a minimum Matthew .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #31:1>
Too much of a good thing can lead to other things .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #32:1>
I know what you 're thinking , &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #33:1>
What does he mean ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #34:1>
keep what down ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #35:1>
Whatever bridging inference you make Matthew that will be the right one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #36:1>
Well , I hope Matthew I 've been clear , yet concise in these few sentences , for I know as communicator that I must understand and be understood by the receiver of my communications .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #37:1>
Know what I mean . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #38:1>
All the very best to you - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #39:1>
reply if you 've the time or inclination .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #40:1>
Who knows I might see you again in the summer - - God forbid ! ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #41:1>
Mine , Sean
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #42:2>
Dearest Anne-flo ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #43:2>
How are you my little-one ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #44:2>
I miss you !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #45:2>
It has only been a week and I feel lonesome without you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #46:2>
Things never work out the way we would like them to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #47:2>
Like fallen leaves that the wind sweeps to and fro , we are indiscriminately swayed by our unsubstantial and frivolous emotions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #48:2>
That 's the way it is , most of the time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #49:2>
Though , I think it can be different sometimes ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #50:2>
we just have to learn to create the conditions for these special times .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #51:2>
Our relationship is just beginning - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #52:2>
growing pains will be part of its growth .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #53:2>
Enough of me being &lsquo; serious &rsquo; , and time for something completely different .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #54:2>
I have finished the work that I had to do - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #55:2>
it 's sufficient , I think , to get an average grade .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #56:2>
Work continues , piles up awaiting critical and analytical thought , though not very much .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #57:2>
Most of my studies don't involve a great deal of intelligence as such , rather an ability to store jargoned data and then regurgitate it clearly and thoughtfully under exam conditions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #58:2>
I sound dissatisfied .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #59:2>
I am and I am not .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #60:2>
One must do what is necessary given the circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #61:2>
It 's just that I will be glad when I can get down to some really interesting topic , and approach it with a beginners beginner 's curiosity coupled with seasoned thought and a desire to understand .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #62:2>
I 'm sorry I 'm being &lsquo; serious &rsquo; again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #63:2>
As you 've gathered Anne-flo ( my little-one ) I 'm writing this on a word processor , my brother 's WP .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #64:2>
It 's Saturday 13th and I 'm sitting alone in my rat infested , damp and dark room .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #65:2>
There 's no food in the cupboards ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #66:2>
not a scrap .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #67:2>
I 've not eaten for days - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #68:2>
when Valerie isn't looking I steal the food from the cats ' bowls .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #69:2>
It isn't very nice and I 'm becoming concerned about long whiskers growing on my face and my new-found affection for &lsquo; Woody &rsquo; !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #70:2>
My nails are growing longer and I 've developed a new habit of climbing over the garden walls at the back of the house .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #71:2>
Not to worry though Anne-flo ( my little-one ) it 's nothing &lsquo; serious &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #72:2>
Miaow ! ! ? ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #73:2>
I trust everything is going well for you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #74:2>
tell me if it is/not .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #75:2>
How 's good old Nanterre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #76:2>
I really miss the place , the ominous architecture , the exciting social-life , the beautiful scenery , the excillarating exhilarating lectures/teachers ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #77:2>
I envy you
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #78:2>
I really do !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #79:2>
I 'll have to stop talking about the place ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #80:2>
it 's bringing tears to my cheeks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #81:2>
Well , that was then ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #82:2>
this is now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #83:2>
The weather has improved .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #84:2>
No more dark , cold and cloudy days where the wind is harsh and the rain unforgiving .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #85:2>
No , it 's rather splendid now what with the warm , comfortable heat , the blooming flowers , and the chirping of the Robin-redbreast early in the morning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #86:2>
Chocolate !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #87:2>
I just hate the stuff .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #88:2>
The problem is &lsquo; it &rsquo; likes me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #89:2>
Oh !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #90:2>
What am I going to do .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #91:2>
I know I don't have to worry about you-and-chocolate for although in the past the two were synomonous synonymous , I am now satisfied you 'll never touch the Evil dark matter again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #92:2>
It 's past midnight and what have I said ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #93:2>
You , my little-one , where are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #94:2>
In my mind/heart yes !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #95:2>
But not here beside me , not close enough for me to be &lsquo; serious &rsquo; to , to caress , to ....
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #96:2>
Yes ! that to too - - to argue with ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #97:2>
In a nutshell , it 's probably uncomfortable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #98:2>
I miss you infinitely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #99:2>
look so much forward to seeing you soon !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #100:2>
All my love and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #101:2>
Got to go now Anne-flo ( my little-one )
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #102:2>
I 've got a rendezvous with &lsquo; Woody &rsquo; in the back garden .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #103:2>
Sean .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #104:3>
Dear Darren ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #105:3>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #106:3>
Yes , I know it 's taken me forever to write to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #107:3>
But , here it is , the definitive piece of prose to put all your other letters to shame .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #108:3>
Firstly , I thank you for the kindness you showed towards me whilst at that Parisian Paradise - - Nanterre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #109:3>
Letting me lie my head down for a few days in your Penthouse was great .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #110:3>
The water-bed was so comfortable , not to mention the delights of the Jacussi Jacuzzi .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #111:3>
I envy you
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #112:3>
I really do .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #113:3>
Our friendship in Paris was a short one , though a good one , I think .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #114:3>
Today is Sunday 14th April , and the mid-afternoon sun is illuminating my room - - where I sit facing a WP screen writing you this letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #115:3>
London is good and warm , though I 've never really spoken to her , just the impression I get .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #116:3>
I 'm studying Computer Operating Systems at the moment - - MS DOS &ampersand; UNIX for example - - as well as two modules in Communication Studies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #117:3>
Work is hard and occasionally rewarding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #118:3>
No pain , no gain , I suppose .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #119:3>
My girlfriend Anne-flo has been over to see me a few times .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #120:3>
Things are going well in that respect though it 's hard keeping a relationship going across the Channel .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #121:3>
I won't say any more about that otherwise this letter will have to be censored &semi; for I know it will find itself attached to the best position your wall can offer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #122:3>
Quite rightly to too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #123:3>
Enough about me for the moment ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #124:3>
what about you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #125:3>
How 's life in cultured Paris ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #126:3>
How 's it going with wine ( Foster 's ) , women and work ( paid holiday ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #127:3>
No doubt you 'll be able to afford that yacht soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #128:3>
Tell me : whether your Fench French has improved ( mine hasn't ) , if you 've made any new friends at Nanterre , or anything else that is new in your life !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #129:3>
What are you doing for the summer , staying in Paris or going home ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #130:3>
As for me , I 'm not sure at the moment whether I 'll be going to tour around France with Anne-flo or staying and working in London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #131:3>
Let me know if you 're planning to tour around France with your girlfriend - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #132:3>
perhaps we could organise something together - - just a thought .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #133:3>
I look forward to your reply Darren , and so for now , I send you warmest wishes and the best of luck !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #134:3>

Dear Nordine ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #136:4>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #137:4>
&lsquo; Not too bad &rsquo; , I hope .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #138:4>
Thanks for your letter
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #139:4>
I was glad to read it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #140:4>
I 'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #141:4>
Studying hasn't given me much time to concentrate on other important things like , writing letters to friends , relaxing etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #142:4>
It 's my fault really
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #143:4>
I should be able to distance myself from work - - not becoming totally identified with it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #144:4>
At this moment I am at home doing some work on a word processor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #145:4>
I 've decided to give myself a break and am writing to you via the WP .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #146:4>
Today is Sunday 14th April ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #147:4>
it 's mid-afternoon and the sun is shining .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #148:4>
Everything is going as it should be .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #149:4>
At the moment I 'm studying Computer Operating systems , MS DOS &ampersand; UNIX for example , as well as a module in Psychology and Language , and one in Writing Styles .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #150:4>
Work is hard , and at the same time interesting and worthwhile .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #151:4>
Though I 'm looking forward to the summer break !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #152:4>
Enough about me for a moment ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #153:4>
what about you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #154:4>
What is it like to be back home studying again in the company of close friends and family ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #155:4>
What are your future study plans , and how are your present studies coming along ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #156:4>
I 'm sure you 're doing well as you have much talent and enthusiasm for your studies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #157:4>
I was impressed by the quality of your work , which I saw whilst at Nanterre ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #158:4>
you are a very sincere person and I value your friendship .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #159:4>
My door will always be open to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #160:4>
Lydia and Valaria wrote to me recently ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #161:4>
they seem to be doing well in Italy - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #162:4>
I will write to them shortly , as I will write to other friends I made at Nanterre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #163:4>
I 'll write again soon , and look forward to your reply .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #164:4>
All the very best wishes ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #165:4>
take care - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #166:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #169:5>
Dearest Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #170:5>
I 've been carrying this card round with me for over two weeks -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #171:5>
I in fact bought it the day after you told me you 'd got a first , - but I 've never got round to writing the letter I wanted to enclose .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #172:5>
So , here it is !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #173:5>
And congratulations ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #174:5>
Have you heard from the British Council yet . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #175:5>
I have tried to 'phone you a couple of times this week although not persistently .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #176:5>
I 'll probably try again tonight so a lot of this letter 'll be old hat .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #177:5>
Ah well ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #178:5>
So , how are things ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #179:5>
How 's the work going ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #180:5>
With all the bits of work you 've done over the years , your CV must be pretty full ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #181:5>
How did Simon 's exams go ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #182:5>
OK , I hope .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #183:5>
I 'm still at Newnham College and will be until 16th August .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #184:5>
I 'm now working in the Bursary as the Bursar 's secretary is going on holiday for three weeks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #185:5>
The Principal 's now in Australia but her Secretary 's going to be away too so I 'll be running between the two offices
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #186:5>
( in fact , I am today ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #187:5>
I don't suppose they 'll pay me double ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #188:5>
The house is still wonderful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #189:5>
Eventually we 'll get round to decorating it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #190:5>
The garden 's coming on well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #191:5>
Mum &ampersand; Dad gave us ten rose bushes as a house warming present &ampersand; we have our first bloom -
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #192:5>
it 's really exciting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #193:5>
( Gosh , the things which satisfy us as we get older ... ! ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #194:5>
Chris is OK although he 's still <unclear-character> not enjoy enjoying his job .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #195:5>
He is now beginning to look around for something else , preferably nearer home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #196:5>
You never know , I may eventually get a full-time job .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #197:5>
I 've not had a permanent job for almost two years now !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #198:5>
I had an interview this morning but the job wasn't what I want - too secretarial .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #199:5>
Maybe I am being fussy but I don't want to spend my life as a secretary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #200:5>
When I look around at my friends , virtually all of them seem to have got careers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #201:5>
And I just can't seem to be able to shift away from being a secretary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #202:5>
I know I 'm good at my job but I want to move on &ampersand; not stay like this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #203:5>
[ Sorry , this is not intended to be a moan or a job story ! ] .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #204:5>
How are your Mum &ampersand; Dad ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #205:5>
And the boys ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #206:5>
Boys ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #207:5>
Men ... ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #208:5>
I saw that Ellie had passed her exams OK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #209:5>
What 's she doing over the Summer ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #210:5>
I must go back to work now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #211:5>
Will speak to you soon &ampersand; definitely see you on 10th August .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #212:5>
I 'm hoping to find out if there 's a bus service ( direct ) from Haverhill to London &ampersand; vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #213:5>
See you soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #214:5>
Take care ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #215:5>
Love , Ruthie x
<ICE-GB:W1B-001 #216:5>
P. S. The wedding photos are wonderful !

APRIL '90
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #2:1>
Buongiorno Emma ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #3:1>
At last I put pen to paper and actually write a letter to you ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #4:1>
A miracle ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #5:1>
Maybe not , but it 's not far from it , as I 'm really pissed off with writing letters to everyone so usually send postcards instead so I don't have to write much !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #6:1>
<unclear-character> Still as lazy as ever ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #7:1>
I guess I 'll never change in that respect ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #8:1>
Had another good day 's skiing but this time had the foresight to stick protective cream upon my face so didn't get burnt but turned a golden brown -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #9:1>
I do worship the sun as you know !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #10:1>
Weather 's been great these last few days so I 'm happy !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #11:1>
What 's it 's like in good old England ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #12:1>
I presume it 's similar to here :
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #13:1>
I can't remember the last time I read a paper -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #14:1>
I never have time these days !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #15:1>
( not that I managed to read one that often in London ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #16:1>
Thus I don't see the around the world weather reports .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #17:1>
What 's life like in No. 86 , Haydon Park rd Rd ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #18:1>
Does Daryl have his &ldquo; friends &rdquo; round at all ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #19:1>
What about the new guy ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #20:1>
Not forgetting Sarah - say hello to her for me -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #21:1>
I still can't believe she gave me a card unlike some people mentioning no names Emma ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #22:1>
By the way , what 's happened to my red Benetton bag ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #23:1>
Could you do me a favour please ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #24:1>
Beg , Beg ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #25:1>
Would you get the Fairground Attraction album ( on CD ) for me - the one with &lsquo; Perfect &rsquo; on ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #26:1>
I 've got it on tape but it 's not a very good copy !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #27:1>
Ta very much ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #28:1>
I don't know what I 'd do if you weren't around to get things for me !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #29:1>
What a star you are - as you would say !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #30:1>
How 's Karen ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #31:1>
Say hello to her for me !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #32:1>
Is Joe still annoying everyone or has she learned to keep her big mouth shut ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #33:1>
I 'm sure she 's not a Virgo -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #34:1>
she 's nothing like me or anyone I know for that matter ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #35:1>
What a weirdo !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #36:1>
What about Nigel -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #37:1>
have you seen him recently ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #38:1>
Is he still as tight as ever ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #39:1>
Is he looking forward to his posting ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #40:1>
God help Jakarta ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #41:1>
Don't mean it really as you know only too well ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #42:1>
Seen anyone else I know ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #43:1>
If not , then what the hell have you been doing ? ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #44:1>
Nag , nag ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #45:1>
So what 's new then ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #46:1>
Have you got any gossip ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #47:1>
I bet you 're all excited for Jeremy !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #48:1>
I 'm really pleased for him - about time he get lucky !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #49:1>
What does Giles think about it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #50:1>
What about my favourite person ( or one of three anyway ) - Cool Dave ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #51:1>
Has he mended the door yet ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #52:1>
God , Emma , all these bloody questions !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #53:1>
I 've just thought something else you can get for me if you don't mind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #54:1>
Could you buy me 5 blank cassettes - TDK AD 90 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #55:1>
( Pack them separately though ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #56:1>
Ta very much !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #57:1>
Well , that 's all the time I had to write you a letter - but it 's not too short so you can't complain !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #58:1>
Thanks again for getting all the stuff for me !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #59:1>
&ldquo; Arrivederci ! &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #60:1>
Love from Jane xx
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #X61:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #X62:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #63:2>
But you can breathe le sigh of relief as I will continue in English .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #64:2>
( I managed to procure some nicer paper than before ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #65:2>
How did your palace adventure go ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #66:2>
I hope you mentioned to Prince Charles that it was high time he had a go at the planners of our public infrastructure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #67:2>
Compared with London , travel around Brussels is so amazingly hassle-free .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #68:2>
And everyone is so polite :
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #69:2>
&ldquo; Bon weekend , monsieur , &rdquo; they say when you go to the Post Office to buy stamps !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #70:2>
( But watch out for the drivers ! ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #71:2>
I have been here 2 1/2 weeks , 1 1/2 in my flat , and I feel very settled already .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #72:2>
The flat 's a delight :
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #73:2>
the first two days were hard , in the sense I could not come to terms with all the space and just me in it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #74:2>
I was reduced to flicking through the 18 channels on TV that you get in Brussels , including BBC1 and BBC2 !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #75:2>
But I have established a handful of friends among the other UK civil servants , and re-established contact with the old friends from previous lives in GB , who are now settled in Brussels .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #76:2>
I had a flat warming last Thursday - a small affair , and you were missed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #77:2>
But I hope to throw the net further in the coming weeks and get to know other nationalities .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #78:2>
Tonight I 'm going to the cinema for the first time in Brussels &semi; for the first time in ages .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #79:2>
We haven't yet decided on what to see .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #80:2>
Apparently there are loads of films which are released here before they are released in the UK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #81:2>
So I 'll be able to recommend forthcoming attractions ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #82:2>
Paul was due to come out this weekend but , has had decided not to now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #83:2>
That 's a shame -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #84:2>
I had been looking forward to his visit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #85:2>
I daresay he may make the trip sometime in April now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #86:2>
And you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #87:2>
What have you two been up to ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #88:2>
Did Emma get in contact with Mike about picking up her gloves ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #89:2>
I haven't written to him yet , and my parents tell me he hasn't contacted them either -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #90:2>
he 's due to ring them up and tell them how much I owe for electricity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #91:2>
I 'd love to know if he 's found a flat-mate yet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #92:2>
I hope he has , otherwise he 'd get so lonely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #93:2>
What is happening with your house situation ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #94:2>
Is Ginny still looking for a flat ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #95:2>
Tonight I 'm going to my first cocktail party at the Commission , my dears !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #96:2>
Actually the last week 's been quite relaxed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #97:2>
Lectures and talks ( mostly pompous and dull ) to explain how the EC works in all its grandiose ways .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #98:2>
I 'm thinking of turning my kitchen into the Eastenders laundrette :
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #99:2>
2 of my friends here have not got a washing machine so they have plans to bring round their dirty clothes , bung them in my machine , and cook me a meal while it 's going .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #100:2>
Life 's a hoot sometimes !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #101:2>
I 'm planning to go to Berlin for a week in May or June .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #102:2>
Should be interesting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #103:2>
But , of course , I 'm still at the stage where I 'm just beginning to explore Brussels .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #104:2>
I have a work number but still no domestic line .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #105:2>
The 'phone company is atrocious here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #106:2>
The work number is , if you ever feel extravagant enough to call me at work , (2)236.57.50 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #107:2>
I 'm hoping I 'll be on the 'phone at home too , in the very near future .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #108:2>
Have you seen any of the others lately ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #109:2>
Nick , for example .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #110:2>
I 've written to him but not a peep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #111:2>
I hope all is well with him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #112:2>
Have you seen James ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #113:2>
I must drop him a line .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #114:2>
The weather has become so mild and summery here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #115:2>
If it continues I 'll be able to have my first shorts and burgers Bar-B-Q on my balcony in no time at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #116:2>
And why not .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #117:2>
If you 're going to be Euro , you may as well go all the way .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #118:2>
I shall close here , wishing you both a fun-and-laughs time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #119:2>
Take care ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #120:2>
Much love ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #121:2>
Bryan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #X122:3>

<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #123:3>
Dear Emma ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #124:3>
How are you darling ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #125:3>
Keeping well I hope .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #126:3>
Well , if you 've seen Natalie , this letter will probably be very boring , as it will contain much the same as hers !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #127:3>
Work is going well &semi; I really enjoy it , though there is still so much that I don't know how to do yet !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #128:3>
The people are really friendly , especially Jeanne , the lady that I work with .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #129:3>
Surprisingly , I managed to find my way to work with no problems even though it involved a change in buses etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #130:3>
I say surprisingly , as while I was wandering aimlessly around Grenoble on Sunday afternoon , I got completely lost and didn't know where the hell I was .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #131:3>
I did , by the way eventually find my way back !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #132:3>
Life here at the Foyer isn't such good news !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #133:3>
There are about 50 other girls ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #134:3>
most appear to be younger than me ( ! ) and are very unfriendly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #135:3>
I haven't really spoken to anyone here since I arrived .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #136:3>
My room is okay , quite large and loads of space to put all my belongings which is one good thing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #137:3>
I also have my own sink .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #138:3>
BUT there are no plugs , so I can't use my hair dryer , my tape recorder or my heating rod for drinks !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #139:3>
I can buy batteries for the tape - but I can see myself spending a fortune !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #140:3>
You can only have showers on week-days after supper , and you have to pay 5 Francs each time -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #141:3>
I couldn't believe it !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #142:3>
You even have to pay extra if you want to have bread with your meal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #143:3>
If I find somewhere else not too expensive I think I 'm going to move out !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #144:3>
I 'll just have to see how things go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #145:3>
Did you have a good time at that at the week-end ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #146:3>
You 'll have to tell me all about it , and of any other interesting gossip that I might like to hear !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #147:3>
I need something to cheer me up these long , boring evenings !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #148:3>
How 's the new job going ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #149:3>
Have you managed to have time away from wife-to-be ! ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #150:3>
Well , never mind , you 'll have to try harder - or am I wrong ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #151:3>
Well , I 'll be waiting to receive my invitation to your 21st .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #152:3>
<unclear-character> I already get excited thinking about it -
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #153:3>
it 's going to be bloody excellent !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #154:3>
I hope you haven't had any more arguement arguments with Natalie since my departure ! ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #155:3>
Well , I 'd better sign off ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #156:3>
I can't think of anything else to say , so I won't bore you any longer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #157:3>
PLEASE write soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #158:3>
I expect to receive as many letters as I did in Paris !
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #159:3>
Take care and lots of love

HI EMMA ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #163:4>
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #164:4>
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #165:4>
AND THAT LONDON IS KEEPING YOU ENTERTAINED .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #166:4>
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS PLACE .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #167:4>
IF I START WITH MY FLAT : IT 'S ON THE 11TH FLOOR OF A MULTI STOREY DESIGNER BLOCK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #168:4>
IT 'S GOT A SWIMMING POOL , 2 X TENNIS COURTS , 2 X SQUASH COURTS , GYM , SAUNAS , JACUZZI , RESTAURANT ETC ETC ETC .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #169:4>
MY FLAT THOUGH IS MINUTE .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #170:4>
ABOUT 2/3 THE SIZE OF YOURS .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #171:4>
I DID HAVE A NICE HOUSE IN ITS OWN GROUNDS , BUT I WANTED TO LIVE IN THIS BLOCK , BECAUSE OF THE FACILITIES , AND THE NEWNESS AND HASSLE FREENESS OF IT ALL .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #172:4>
ITS It 's ALSO A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE BECAUSE ITS it 's FULL OF SINGLE AMERICAN , OZZIE ETC ETC EXPATS , OF BOTH SEXES .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #173:4>
SO , IT HAS A KINDA kind of IN BUILT SOCIAL LIFE TOO .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #174:4>
THE PEOPLE AT THE EMBASSY HERE ARE ... WELL YOU KNOW .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #175:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #176:4>
THEN THERE ARE THE YOUNGISH COUPLES AVEC ENFANTS , SO I STAY WELL CLEAR OF THAT .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #177:4>
THE OTHERS THEN START AT ABOUT 32/33 , BUT ARE GOING ON 52/53 IN THE HEAD .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #178:4>
SO , I CAN SAY , THAT WITHOUT EXCEPTION , MY SOCIAL LIFE HERE , IS TOTALLY NON-EMBASSY .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #179:4>
IT IS ENTIRELY EX-PAT .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #180:4>
THAT IS ENTIRELY GOOD .
<ICE-GB:W1B-002 #181:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #2:1>
Dear thing ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #3:1>
started Started on Gerard Hughes ' &ldquo; God of Surprises &rdquo; tonight and already feel better .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #4:1>
May even send you some of it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #5:1>
Do let me know if you 'd like me to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #6:1>
The first chapter asks about your daydreams and then as an exercise you have to write yourself an obituary one which in your wildest dreams you would love to have .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #7:1>
I also read the following sentence .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #8:1>
I find I have none and any that I do have are too vague to mention .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #9:1>
I can't distinguish between my different daydreams because I don't have any .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #10:1>
I don't dare to have !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #11:1>
What an admission for an actor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #12:1>
Before you come to the conclusion this book I 'm reading is highly dubious it is written by a Jesuit priest and reccomended recommended by our mentor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #13:1>
Debbie phoned then with a problem , (
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #14:1>
why do people ask my advice when I can't even sort my own life out ? )
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #15:1>
Better go to sleep now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #16:1>
Wish you 'd phone you fart face
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #17:1>
it would be lovely to speak to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #18:1>
1.AM .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #19:1>
No desire to sleep at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #20:1>
Talk to you for a while .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #21:1>
Saw an amazing programme on T.V. tonight with some people walking across Australia and felt the most amazing desire to get out there and see it all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #22:1>
Jungles and planes , mountains and wide open spaces , dense tropical rain forests .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #23:1>
What would you like to do ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #24:1>
Can you daydream ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #25:1>
I have to start it seems .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #26:1>
I 'd like an evening with Murray , Julie , Nigel , Paul and Bernadette , and we 'll throw in you and your Peter and Gill .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #27:1>
Isn't it funny that one of the things I most pine for is just intelligent adult communication .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #28:1>
Not considered a luxury by most .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #29:1>
What are you going to do with all those evenings after the show ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #30:1>
You 'd better hurry up and get to know the women , you know what you 're like with strangers ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #31:1>
What would you be saying if you were here ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #32:1>
&ldquo; I want to act ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #33:1>
I know I want to act .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #34:1>
&rdquo; And I want to meet someone and eventually have some children , Eventually &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #35:1>
Yes <unclear-word> It 's easy to imagine you doing all this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #36:1>
I wonder if you 'll be more centered at 40 or whether you 'll be the same as <unclear-word> you are now ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #37:1>
What kind of man would you like to be ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #38:1>
And how would I like to be ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #39:1>
Well as you asked I 'd like to be softer , quieter ( yes , ha ha !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #40:1>
I said quieter ! ) happier , more at peace , more serenity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #41:1>
I don't mean less specific , more specific , more focussed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #42:1>
End of the page , better go to sleep I suppose .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #43:1>
I can write can't I ? ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #44:1>
Mon PM .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #45:1>
Debbie 's got the clock !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #46:1>
About 1 AM ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #47:1>
Went to see &ldquo; A world apart &rdquo; tonight .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #48:1>
Again by accident more about S. A .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #49:1>
One line really struck me -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #50:1>
And I think of myself and doing nothing in this country about all the wrong around me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #51:1>
Thought of Jeff and how deeply he cares about the political situation in this country .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #52:1>
Thats That 's the kind of man I 'd like to meet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #53:1>
A man who cares deeply about things further away than his nose and preferably a man who acts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #54:1>
Someone who bothers , who fights .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #55:1>
I can't stand apathy after David and his cricket , pipe and slippers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #56:1>
Not that one would want to be fighting all the time , its it 's the desire to act for change that 's important .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #57:1>
Andy , bless him , fixed my porch light up today , So so I 'm a &lsquo; light unto the street &rsquo; if nothing else .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #58:1>
My eyes close against my will .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #59:1>
Sleep ........
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #60:1>
5 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #61:1>
Tuesday -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #62:1>
Goodge St. Station .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #63:1>
Last singing lesson this term with Christopher Littlewood .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #64:1>
Fantastic man , fantastic lessons , so clever .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #65:1>
Don't know what I 'm going to do now ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #66:1>
his private waiting list is &ldquo; depressingly long &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #67:1>
So I 'll just have to wait I guess .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #68:1>
How are you today I wonder ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #69:1>
Shit - Train resembles Sardine Can .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #70:1>
But by some miracle I get a seat .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #71:1>
Emily 's Registration day at school today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #72:1>
Into a new group : different friends and all in French .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #73:1>
She 's so completely lovely and fun and joyful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #74:1>
You 'd like me in the clothes I 'm wearing today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #75:1>
White flying shirt , white trousers too big , baggy , black braces .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #76:1>
Big loopy , silver hoops earings , shades !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #77:1>
Think you 'd be prepared to be seen with me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #78:1>
My Spiritual life has gone in a complete U turn since I picked up Gerard Hughes and found a new Church .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #79:1>
Didn't tell you about that did I ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #80:1>
Can't remember .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #81:1>
Anyway I 'm actually looking forward to this evening at home so that I can pray !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #82:1>
In the ways where you put yourself into the scenes in the life of J. C. to learn what they really mean to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #83:1>
Its It 's exausting exhausting but rewarding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #84:1>
I found it easy to cast myself as the man with a legion of evil spirits as they suggested -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #85:1>
Those being , Anger , fear e.t.c. but I couldn't really accept that J. C. could get them all out of me and into the pigs and drop them into the sea .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #86:1>
But I 'm working on it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #87:1>
Another letter with no jokes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #88:1>
I miss you fart face .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #89:1>
- There 's a good joke -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #90:1>
Not a lot I 'll admit but I do miss you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #91:1>
My Millionaire is buying me an Indian tomorrow , the one who says my acting is &ldquo; Competant Competent &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #92:1>
bloody cheek !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #93:1>
He does make me laugh though -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #94:1>
He is so rude .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #95:1>
Makes my insults tame .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #96:1>
Still not at Hendon and onto another page .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #97:1>
Will have to find a post box for this somewhere .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #98:1>
Typical that I have no deliveries to my house but I can still get letters to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #99:1>
Bloody typical .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #100:1>
Bought 2 tapes off a street vendor for &pound-sign;2 each : a M. Jackson tape of Bad and a Eurythmics tape &lsquo; Savage &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #101:1>
Terrible to buy pirate tapes really but they are fairly well established
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #102:1>
Got to get up at 6.30 am tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #103:1>
And Peter ( the millionaire ) is an insomniac so I 'll not be gone from him till 2 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #104:1>
Better go now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #105:1>
Good old Hendon next stop .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #106:1>
Guess who 's got a porch light that is fixed up then !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #107:1>
Some progress !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #108:1>
x Bye Muggins .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #109:2>
( Kiss envelope ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #110:2>
Dearest D. B .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #111:2>
How lovely to be writing to you again !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #112:2>
Spoke to Murray the other night and don't feel frustrated with you any more .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #113:2>
Sitting at the Spanish Embassy in London having just spoken to the Consul .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #114:2>
I am trying to trace my Father !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #115:2>
It 's very exciting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #116:2>
I 've never done it before partly because all my friends thought it was a stupid Idea but following Bernadette 's experience of finding her Father and then him dying the following year I thought I ought to track mine down .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #117:2>
And the Watts , who took me out to Dinner , boast boast , thought it was a great Idea .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #118:2>
I only needed a little extra encouragement .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #119:2>
Its It 's strange ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #120:2>
I don't look like my mother and everyone here presumes I 'm Spanish and is surprised that I don't speak a word .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #121:2>
Mind you I 'm made up with my hair tied back , dressed all in black and with some particularly nice earrings so all that helps .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #122:2>
To meet someone you look like and whose blood and characteristics you have ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #123:2>
To find out the other half of the story , what really happened ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #124:2>
This is the second time in my life I 've felt like something in a film ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #125:2>
the first time was sitting at 18 surrounded by consultants being told that my Mother was &rdquo; very seriously ill and it only being a matter of time ... &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #126:2>
How would you act someone in this situation ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #127:2>
And who would expect the character to pull out a pink notebook and begin writing a letter ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #128:2>
And what are the thoughts and feelings you 'd expect the character to have ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #129:2>
I don't feel any fear -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #130:2>
If he 's dead , I 'll be dissapointed disappointed but at least I 'll have done this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #131:2>
I 've been thinking for years - &rdquo; sometime &ldquo; but thought when is there ever time ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #132:2>
But now I feel very happy here , even amongst these people .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #133:2>
Speaking with these heavy Spanish accents that he 'll have if I ever speak to him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #134:2>
29 years and I 've done nothing and now - I want all the answers today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #135:2>
Or at least to know if he 's alive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #136:2>
I 'll have to bring him news of my Mother 's death and my daughter , his grand-daughter 's life .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #137:2>
I don't think I told you that <unclear-characters> some years ago - I must have been about 12 a man came to the house asking about someone by the name of Losada and my Mother denied knowing anything and I remember him looking at me and saying &ldquo; I 'm sure your Mother knows more than she 's saying . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #138:2>
incident stuck in my mind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #139:2>
My agent called me in this morning to tell me how good he was .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #140:2>

someone called out yes , for goodbye .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #142:2>
That was the one word of Spanish my Mother did bring me up with and it was only a few years ago when I said it to someone and they said &rdquo; What ? &ldquo; I reali<del>s</del>zed realized it was not used by everyone ...

<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #145:2>
Well , He 's Dead ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #146:2>
I should 've known being me that fate could never be so kind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #147:2>
It was so easy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #148:2>
He just looked in the Madrid phone book and there I am - ! Losada : BALBONTIN J. M .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #149:2>
My name is Juanita
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #150:2>
his was JUAN MARIE -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #151:2>
I could 've done it years ago .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #152:2>
Why does he have to have died ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #153:2>
In these days when people live to 80 ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #154:2>
So <unclear-characters> now here I am bereaved again of a man I never knew .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #155:2>
Tonight I will phone and speak to his younger brother , my uncle !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #156:2>
And find out if I have any 1/2 brothers and 1/2 sisters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #157:2>
But its it 's not the same is it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #158:2>
He may not even have liked his brother , and there is so much I needed to ask him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #159:2>
Oh well , end of letter for now I guess .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #160:2>
Excuse me won't you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #161:2>
Suddenly I don't feel like talking .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #162:2>
I 'll just have to suffer a bit I guess till I get used to the Idea ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #163:2>
I wouldn't have minded if he 'd been 90 and blind and smelt .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #164:2>
Part Two .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #165:2>
Yes , dear friend , and may the blue bird of happiness shit all over you too !
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #166:2>
Well I just read your letter over ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #167:2>
When I said on the phone that you were right and I was wrong I meant in the area you write of giving you encouragement and support and not telling you what a wally you are .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #168:2>
Of course you are quite right and you never critisize criticise ( spel ? ) me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #169:2>
Why are you not worthy of being loved ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #170:2>
No I can't understand any of this at all -
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #171:2>
Why do you feel these &ldquo; self destructive , self loathing desires &rdquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #172:2>
What strong words you use .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #173:2>
Do you really feel bad about yourself ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #174:2>
No I don't understand this at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #175:2>
Take a look at some of the wally's wallies in the world .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #176:2>
When I stand in the supermarket in Tesco 's I know I deserve to be loved at least as much as my fellows in the queue .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #177:2>
There is one thing I 've learn't learnt about love with 7 years with Riley and that is that if you love someone you have to love them for what they are .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #178:2>
Not for what they could be , or what they could become or what they are sometimes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #179:2>
You have to love another human being the way God loves us without expecting us to change first .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #180:2>
As Murray wrote to me : &ldquo; God loves you as you are , and its it 's knowing that that brings change . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #181:2>
As for whatever I said on the phone about our relationship , well if you can remember any of it still please forget it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #182:2>
Its It 's just that sometimes last thing at night on the phone I say things I shouldn't thats
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #183:2>
thats that 's all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #184:2>
Anyway you may soon be rid of me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #185:2>
I 've been asked out by a guy next week who also has his daughter at the Lycee .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #186:2>
He works in investment and is obviously loaded with cash with a house in Eccleston Sq in London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #187:2>
He speaks 3 languages and lives all over Europe .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #188:2>
He lost his wife through cancer and his daughter is also 4 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-003 #189:2>
Anyway more of that later ...

<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #3:1>
Dearest Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #4:1>
Please excuse me being lazy by word processing this letter !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #5:1>
It 's 3.15 pm and I 'm waiting for the gas man to come and fix our cooker .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #6:1>
I suppose the fact that he 's due to come this &ldquo; afternoon &rdquo; means he could come as late as 5.00 pm and I need to go out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #7:1>
I couldn't go out this morning because I felt full of 'flu .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #8:1>
Now I 've been up a few hours I think I 've just got a bad cold .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #9:1>
I had one last week too but it seemed to get better over the weekend &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #10:1>
then it came back to haunt me !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #11:1>
I 'm not really feeling sorry for myself ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #12:1>
I must thank you , Simon and your parents &ldquo; officially &rdquo; for the slow cooker and table cloth you gave us for our wedding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #13:1>
So ... THANK YOU ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #14:1>
You 've all been very kind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #15:1>
Please pass on our thanks to your Mum and Dad .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #16:1>
How are they both ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #17:1>
And how are you two ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #18:1>
Both studying hard by the sound of it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #19:1>
How many essays left now ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #20:1>
Have you got a job sorted out for the Summer yet ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #21:1>
I 've applied for some jobs , mainly senior secretarial .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #22:1>
Last week I had an interview for the IPM ( Institute of Personnel Management ) course ( one afternoon and evening a week ) at Anglia College in Cambridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #23:1>
To do the course ( I won't know for another couple of months whether or not I have a place ) I really need a job in personnel and so I 'm writing speculative letters for that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #24:1>
However , I don't have much hope for getting anything there with the current employment situation and if a decent secretarial job comes up then I 'll take it and not do the course this year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #25:1>
I can't afford to waste any opportunities &semi; I 've only been unemployed for a few weeks and am sick of it and there are so many people without jobs at the moment it 's ridiculous not to take a job if it 's OK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #26:1>
Also , we do need the money considering we 've just taken on a mortgage .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #27:1>
As you will have gathered , the pickie at the top of the letter is of our house .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #28:1>
Good , innit isn't it ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #29:1>
It 's really embarrassing at the moment because everyone in the street - and I mean everyone - has cut their lawn except us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #30:1>
My aunt and uncle gave us a hover mower for our wedding but we didn't have that until Daddy brought that to us on Monday evening .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #31:1>
Since then we 've had to assemble it , buy a plug for it and it 's rained ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #32:1>
All the other gardens are so neat and ours looks tatty ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #33:1>
Chris is going to America for two weeks on 27 April for two weeks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #34:1>
I 'll miss him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #35:1>
Mum 's coming up for a few days and then Daddy 's joining us on the bank holiday weekend ( back to the camp bed for me -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #36:1>
we 've only one bed ! ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #37:1>
They 're going to help do some things in the garden and house for us but I 've got to make sure they don't take over :
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #38:1>
Chris and I are both practical and we will get on and do things &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #39:1>
Ian and I have never done things because Daddy never encouraged us to do things -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #40:1>
he just did everything to do with the house ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #41:1>
that was the way it was .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #42:1>
We were encouraged to do things in the garden , as Chris has been &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #43:1>
we 've just not had any interest in doing parents ' gardens &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #44:1>
doing one 's own garden is very different .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #45:1>
Don't I waffle on ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #46:1>
A date for your diary : Saturday , 18 May .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #47:1>
As Simon will tell you , that is Cup Final Day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #48:1>
However , the important thing is that we are having a house warming party and you must come .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #49:1>
I don't know when Ian will be getting here but if you can come ( and we 'll be very disappointed if you don't ) and can't come with him , I know you know about coaches to Cambridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #50:1>
There are buses from Cambridge to Haverhill and I presume there are from Audley End Station too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #51:1>
Audley End ( Saffron Walden ) is the nearest railway station to us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #52:1>
And anyway , one of us would always pick you up from Cambridge or Audley End .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #53:1>
Depending on who comes , you 'll possibly need to bring sleeping bags and I hope you don't mind sleeping on the floor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #54:1>
I hope Simon told you that I rang last night .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #55:1>
I 've put down your name as a referee on an application form to do voluntary work at Oxfam .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #56:1>
I hope that 's OK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #57:1>
I think that 's all the news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #58:1>
You must come and visit us as soon as you can .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #59:1>
When you 're in Cambridge we 'll hopefully be able to see more of you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #60:1>
All the jobs I 've applied for so far are in Cambridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #61:1>
I hope you 're both OK and work and studying is going well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #62:1>
Take care ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #63:1>
Love from us both .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #64:1>
Lots of love ,

Dear ( F ) Laura !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #71:2>
Muchas gracias for your letter which came this morning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #72:2>
It was nice to hear from you - when I finally got it open !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #73:2>
What had you glued it down with ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #74:2>
I don't think I will come to your linguistics party dodo on Wednesday as I 've still got a lot of revision to do .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #75:2>
I 'm sure you won't mind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #76:2>
I may well be tempted into the party that Helen was talking about depending how much work I have to do ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #77:2>
you know how it goes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #78:2>
I am totally pissed off with Middlesex Poly who are totally cocking up our Spanish placements .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #79:2>
There were four placements in Valencia working for an educational software company as a proof-reader of English educational packages but have I got one of them NO .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #80:2>
We have been worried that there is a booby prize of a telephonists telephonist 's job in a village in the middle of nowhere .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #81:2>
The company shuts down for 3 months over the summer and is too stingy to buy an answering machine so one of us is going to be lucky enough to sit in an office for 3 months alone .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #82:2>
If I get this I will buy them an answering machine and go to the beach .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #83:2>
Anyhow I 'm now trying to organize my own placement with the Open University in Barcelona so I 'm keeping my fingers crossed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #84:2>
Tomorrow I 'm meeting Sarah Duncan for lunch -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #85:2>
she 's back from New Zealand .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #86:2>
Then Jane and I are going to Camden and then to the cinema or to eat or something .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #87:2>
Ice skating was a laugh except I have forgotten EVERYTHING -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #88:2>
Jane and I were in the beginners - &lsquo; bend zee knees &rsquo; - group .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #89:2>
Anyhow I didn't fall over .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #90:2>
Your new earrings look lovely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #91:2>
You spendthrift !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #92:2>
Anyhow why not ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #93:2>
I 'm still lusting after that ring but can't afford it tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #94:2>
I will get my hands on it soon though ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #95:2>
I can't remember when I spoke to you last .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #96:2>
Wednesday 's exam was a DISASTER .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #97:2>
I don't think I wrote like a lawyer at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #98:2>
Never mind - there 's always the retakes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #99:2>
I also discovered that Gary is one of these highly IRRITATING people who mutter whilst they write .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #100:2>
Trust me to sit beside him ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #101:2>
There 's one more paper on Friday ( 14th ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #102:2>
So I haven't finished the agony yet ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #103:2>
Well that 's all my news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #104:2>
See/write/hear/phone you soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #105:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #106:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #108:2>
Sorry for boring paper .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #109:2>
I couldn't be bothered to get up and get anything else !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #110:3>

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #114:3>
Even though I spoke to you just last night I thought I 'd write you a letter whilst I psyche myself up to do some revision .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #115:3>
How boring !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #116:3>
I don't really want to spend the whole day learning about neural nets , knowledge representation , prolog and natural lang. processing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #117:3>
Talking of which I did hear from Switzerland concerning the course - only problem being that they won't decide whether or not you can have a grant until you have paid for the course in full .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #118:3>
So I thought I 'd give it a miss !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #119:3>
I 'm sorry about Thursday night -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #120:3>
mother has v. kindly offered to buy me a few items for Spain and is only available then .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #121:3>
However it will be nice to have lunch on Friday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #122:3>
On Saturday I 'm off to a fireworks &ampersand; classical music evening at Leeds Castle which should be good .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #123:3>
If you 're not doing anything on Thursday 4th July me , Jane &ampersand; Angie + anyone else who may appear are going to the Mexican restaurant in Leicester Sq. ( will cost about &pound-sign;14/&pound-sign;15 ) as a last celebration before I go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #124:3>
We won't go till about 7-7.30ish I don't imagine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #125:3>
It is delicious .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #126:3>
Had a disastrous day at poly presenting my poem -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #127:3>
clearly the lecturers were not impressed by it at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #128:3>
They seemed to like the shittiest ones best .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #129:3>
But that 's the way - it goes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #130:3>
It would be really nice if you could come to Spain - you can get cheap flights to Barcelona for about &pound-sign;80 &semi; even slightly better ones are not as cheap costly as Italy flights .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #131:3>
( not Not between 5/8 and 12/8 if you don't mind as if Antonis comes it will be then ) . . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #132:3>
I 'm sorry about Brandy - maybe he will be sitting on a cloud with all your hammies and Basil ( the Gardener ) by now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #133:3>
Write/hear/see you soon .

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #141:4>
Thank you for your letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #142:4>
I enclose the photos you ordered with the following exceptions :
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #143:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #144:4>

One more to follow when les parents return from Italy in a fortnight - Boots printed the wrong one ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #148:4>
the correct one has been reordered .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #149:4>
How were your end of degree celebrations and lunch with Sonja ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #150:4>
When are your results and graduation ceremony ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #151:4>
Thanks for your good luck wishes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #152:4>
Studying is progressing well ( good mark for first test ) and I recommence umpiring , after a fortnights fortnight 's break , with the Bank of England at Guildford next Saturday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #153:4>
As Simon probably 's told you , we met yesterday at the Middlesex Cup Final ( Southgate 9 Southgate Adelaide 0 ! ) where I was on ground and ball person duty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #154:4>
Next Sunday , I may watch Middlesex v. Kent ( cricket ) at Southgate but access to pavillion pavilion is restricted to County Club members !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #155:4>
This limited use of my clubs club 's facilities has now put me off going .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #156:4>
Regards to your family -
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #157:4>
I hope you are all well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #158:4>

I hope all your essay writing is successfully complete and you are now having a well earned rest !
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #172:5>
My first two Surrey Championship cricket games have gone well - no problems and played in a friendly spirit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #173:5>
Studying is progressing slowly but surely and to timetable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #174:5>
Regards to Simon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #175:5>
I trust you are both well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-004 #176:5>
Best wishes

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #4:1>
I wanted to send you the &ldquo; Canonbury &rdquo; card - 15 &ampersand; 16th century layout - but have run out of them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #5:1>
Instead , there is a later issue including adjoining &lsquo; environs &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #6:1>
I have outlined the triangular heart of Islington , Canonbury , which I hope to show you in June .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #7:1>
Strangely , or coincidently I had to visit my cousin in Whittington Hospital tonight and had to pass the milestone with Dick Whittington and his catd cat alongside .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #8:1>
This is another &lsquo; must &rsquo; for you , namely Dick Whittington 's Trail , Dick Turpin 's Trail and the Islington Trail of Poets to Isledon Canonbury ( The Towers ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #9:1>
Plenty sports on this card for Simon - I mean 2 centuries ago ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #10:1>
Love from Mary

12.50 AM .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #13:2>
Dear David ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #14:2>
Thought you were due a letter not written on a train , no description of batty passengers whilst going through Belsize Park .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #15:2>
It 's the middle of the night and all is quiet , even the cat is asleep and there is only the clock ticking its way to 1 A.M .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #16:2>
So , why this at this hour of the morning ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #17:2>
Well we have just been on the phone and I want to say Thank you , officially , on paper , for your being there and being understanding , supportive , wise and with humour .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #18:2>
You have been there for me all through this crazy relationship with Colin and have listened to all the rubbish I 've reported ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #19:2>
you 've neither judged or encouraged me but you have allowed me to be myself and make my choices .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #20:2>
You have also helped me proffessionally professionally ( one f ! ) as your comments and general enthusiasm about my showreel have been more important than you might realise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #21:2>
It is easy to become discouraged .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #22:2>
I can feel you beginning to buckle under the weight of all this sincerity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #23:2>
What can I insult you about to counter all this ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #24:2>
Yes , you are still one of the most annoying people I 've ever met .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #25:2>
Thank you for our phone calls , for listening to me and , even more , for talking to me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #26:2>
I will pray for you and Andrea that a time will come when you can see each other again , keep the love without the dependancy dependency somehow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #27:2>
For the right conclusion , with joy and without pain or compromise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #28:2>
Can't think of how to end this without the risk of paying you another compliment and I don't want all this to go to your head .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #29:2>
You drive me crazy but you 've been fantastic .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #30:2>
xx I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #31:3>
Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #32:3>
Well what can I say ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #33:3>
Your You 're brilliant , wonderful , amazingly stunning -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #34:3>
I 'm so proud for you ! ! , or should I say of you !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #35:3>
Its It 's fantastic that you 're going to Barcelona &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #36:3>
its it 's one place I really want to go , chiefly to see Gaudi 's architecture .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #37:3>
It was great to see you and Lee the other day , its it 's ages since we 've managed to get together for a natter -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #38:3>
send lots of love to Lee when you speak/see him and of course that goes for Simey also .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #39:3>
As for my Nipon Nippon trip , it 's funny but during next wk after I saw you I did yet more thinking and something a very good friend said and things everyone had vaguely been saying made me realise what shit I was putting myself through .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #40:3>
I finally decided I needed to give Uts an ultimatum - great only he was impossible of course to get in touch with -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #41:3>
no address , no etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #42:3>
So having put away pictures of him , deciding to be highly sceptical of what might happen what happens but he phones - typical !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #43:3>
I was on the phone for over 2 hrs .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #44:3>
Anyway the outcome was that I told him in no uncertain terms that if he wanted this relationship to exist and work he 'd have to do something about it because I 'd had enough .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #45:3>
Dad 's flashing freeby paper !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #46:3>
What the hell is this ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #47:3>
I am prepared to work at this relationship because I think its it 's worth it , but he 's going to have to do most of the running
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #48:3>
otherwise I 'm out of it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #49:3>
I wanted to tell you this because we were talking about it when I saw you and I wanted you to realise that I was am not about to be taken for a ride , <unclear-word> .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #50:3>
I surprised myself how strong I was and am and I 'm very pleased .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #51:3>
This is however only the beginning and I 'm not sure if it will work out -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #52:3>
I 'll have to wait &ampersand; see .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #53:3>
Well enough of that , keep it to yourself .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #54:3>
So isn't the weather gorgeous ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #55:3>
I can't wait to go away for 10 days ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #56:3>
it will be truely truly wonderful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #57:3>
This week I completed a 50 hr fast , nothing but water .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #58:3>
It 's recommended to clear out your insides both mentally and physically and having decided I needed something fairly dramatic I went for it -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #59:3>
I honestly feel great now , although my stomach can't seem to handle anything stronger than fruit at the moment !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #60:3>
Oh Laura I must go ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #61:3>
I 'm expecting Jon at any moment and I do want to get this off to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #62:3>
It was so gd to see you - must get together when I get back .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #63:3>
When are you going away ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #64:3>
Is Simey going to too ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #65:3>
Well I 'm so , so pleased about your 1st ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #66:3>
not that I doubted you deserved it , but with these degree things surprising things can happen , like 3rds ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #67:3>
Anyway lots of love to Fleur , Simey and Lee and of course yourself ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #68:3>
you must be so happy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #69:3>
Lots of love and hugs
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #70:3>

Dear ( F ) Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #73:4>
How are you since Friday ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #74:4>
Did you find a photo frame ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #75:4>
After I had left you on Friday I had a little spend .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #76:4>
I bought part of your Christmas present - not telling you what it is .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #77:4>
I bought some Armani perfume as I got a free gift with it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #78:4>
Didn't find any trousers till yesterday till when I got a pair reduced in Wallis sale from 30 to &pound-sign;23 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #79:4>
I don't think I 'd better spend anymore ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #80:4>
Especially as I bought my ticket to Italy for October -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #81:4>
it was &pound-sign;20 cheaper than in the brochure ! ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #82:4>
It looks as though Antonio just may come to Barcelona between 5/8 and 12/8 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #83:4>
If I can find a flat and he can get a seat on a plane .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #84:4>
Yesterday I went to Leeds Castle with Andy and Alison and all the other marrieds .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #85:4>
I have decided that is the last time I go out with them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #86:4>
I am clearly not good enough for them because I 'm on the SHELF .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #87:4>
I was virtually ignored for most of the evening .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #88:4>
So I 'm not bothering to contact them whilst I 'm in Spain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #89:4>
Gill was also upset as they made no effort to speak to her new man .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #90:4>
But enough of my news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #91:4>
What have you been doing this weekend ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #92:4>
Anything nice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #93:4>
I 'm trying to psyche myself up to do some computer theory revision .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #94:4>
BORING .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #95:4>
Are you coming on Thursday ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #96:4>
I forgot to mention it to you on Friday when I saw you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #97:4>
If you are interested - Chiquitas - Leceister Leicester Square -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #98:4>
7.30 - Thursday ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #99:4>
about &pound-sign;15 per head .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #100:4>
I think I mentioned it in one of my last letters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #101:4>
Well it 's nearly results days .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #102:4>
If I haven't passed it 's going to cost me a lot of money to come home and re-take .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #103:4>
Well I think that 's all my news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #104:4>
Hope to hear from you soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #105:4>
I have found out that I go on Monday 8th July so maybe I 'll have a chance to see you before <unclear-character> I go .

Dear Laura !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #109:5>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #110:5>
Happy 25th Birthday for Monday although this letter will arrive days and days after your birthday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #111:5>
Well , what have you been up to ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #112:5>
I can't believe that I 've been here for three weeks already .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #113:5>
Our project is still not getting off the ground as basically our supervisor is not in the least forthcoming as far as initial info. is concerned .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #114:5>
He is also the most unsexy Spaniard I have ever seen !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #115:5>
Not quite as handsome as a certain Galician who chucks ice-cream down the odd cleavage ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #116:5>
I can't remember what I said to you in my last letter so ignore any repeats .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #117:5>
Wednesday was as I think I told you written off due to a hangover .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #118:5>
Cheapy wine is o.k. till the morning after ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #119:5>
Today I made a purchase .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #120:5>
A pair of leggings .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #121:5>
Can you believe ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #122:5>
I actually found a flattering pair and infact in fact may invest in some more before I come home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #123:5>
They &ldquo; don't &rdquo; cling in the right places ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #124:5>
Last night we discovered a new square to drink in .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #125:5>
It is much nicer than some of the other places we 've been to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #126:5>
In a much nicer area , away from the average back-packing German tourist ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #127:5>
I also purchased Antonio a really nice shirt in Benetton sale .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #128:5>
Pure cotton paisley for about &pound-sign;5.50 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #129:5>
I was then very bad and spent &pound-sign;15 on a ticket to go and see Elvis Costello on Monday night .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #130:5>
I 'm really only going to cheer Sarah up .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #131:5>
She is a bit of a Fiona-Judith cross .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #132:5>
Very nice but either really happy or totally depressed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #133:5>
I have to say I 'm having a good time but am not greatly struck by the company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #134:5>
They are really nice but not really my sort of people .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #135:5>
I don't want to spend a fortune on getting drunk every night but if I don't I get the feeling they think I 'm really stuffy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #136:5>
There is some fantastic jewellery here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #137:5>
I think I may well be tempted before I come home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #138:5>
28.7.91
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #139:5>
Oh dear !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #140:5>
I seem to have a hangover yet again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #141:5>
Last night we went out with our Belgium flat-mate , his friend who is staying for a week and some of the others who are here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #142:5>
I have to say apart from Sarah <unclear-word> and one or two of the other girls blokes who are here I am not very taken by the company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #143:5>
Two of the girls in particular seem to have great delight in making snide remarks all the time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #144:5>
Last night I was ready to tip beer over one of them but decided I wouldn't stoop to her level .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #145:5>
As well as out on Monday it looks as though we are going out with a whole load of engineers on Tuesday night -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #146:5>
I wonder if there will be any hunks ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #147:5>
The problem is I think he may be here at the same time as Antonio .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #148:5>
Anyhow enough about me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #149:5>
What have you been doing lately ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #150:5>
How were Simon 's exams ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #151:5>
When does he get the results ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #152:5>
We are being visited by one of our tutors on Wednesday -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #153:5>
it is going to be quite embarrassing as we don't know this guy -
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #154:5>
he 's a Maths professor (
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #155:5>
I hope that means Maths and not Maths &ampersand; Logic ! ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #156:5>
I don't think he speaks Spanish so that will show us up even more .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #157:5>
On top of all this we still can't do our project .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #158:5>
Anyhow are you coming to stay ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #159:5>
If so when ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #160:5>
It would be lovely to see you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #161:5>
Apparently a friend of a friend got a cheap flight for &pound-sign;69 the other day so you may well be lucky .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #162:5>
Getting around isn't too bad on the metro .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #163:5>
The last few days haven't been quite so hot and on Friday night it actually rained .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #164:5>
I think today is going to be a scorcher by the looks of things .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #165:5>
A hangover is worse in 32&degree; of heat !
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #166:5>
Well that 's all my news for now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #167:5>
Maybe you have got one of my letters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #168:5>
I am looking out for post each day but it 's very slow <unclear-word> getting here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-005 #169:5>

11.20 pm
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #3:1>
Dear Bill ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #4:1>
After all this talk of letters and the fact that this is the first I am almost anxious about how to write to you ... but not quite .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #5:1>
When I came back from the station I thought of all the good things about us having 2 weeks apart , all the time
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #6:1>
we 'd have , time to read , time to study
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #7:1>
and I was just starting to look at my textbooks with optimism and then it got dark .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #8:1>
A strange silence fell on the house and suddenly there was a big space and you weren't here and weren't going to be .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #9:1>
And the sheets seemed very white .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #10:1>
Emily appeared and wanted to sleep in my bed
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #11:1>
and then Pamela 's mother arrived
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #12:1>
and I could have put Pam in Emily 's bed instead of on a camp bed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #13:1>
But no , I put Emily back in her own bed after she 'd fallen asleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #14:1>
I want to sleep in our bed alone and know the space , feel your absence fully , not have it filled with Emily .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #15:1>
I have so much to thank you for .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #16:1>
You have given me you and you have restored to me myself .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #17:1>
I was drowning in deep grey fear .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #18:1>
I know that you can only despise me for having allowed these waters to overwhelm me
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #19:1>
but I had been struggling to tread water to fight my way up to keep swimming and , in spite of all my strength , there was a current that pulled me down down and wouldn't let me breath breathe .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #20:1>
And of course I was holding Emily up with all my energy as well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #21:1>
Its It 's hard to swim with a child holding on to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #22:1>
Anyway enough being poetic .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #23:1>
Why do I tell you all this again when I know you would have had to be <unclear-character> a serene and beautiful tree , happy in the sun , grateful and appreciative of being in such a field and with much fruit ... ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #24:1>
Well , I have to be honest with you
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #25:1>
and I want to tell you again how I felt your arms take hold of me and swim up to the light .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #26:1>
I hope you don't feel this burdens you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #27:1>
I am a very strong swimmer but even the most confident swimmers can drown can't they my dear ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #28:1>
Thank you for your gentleness , your sensitivity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #29:1>
Thank you for your kindness -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #30:1>
In fact here is a piece from the Bible about love ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #31:1>
see what you think &semi;

The other line I told you about &ldquo; Love keeps no record of wrongs &rdquo; is in a different translation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #39:1>
Why have I ended up quoting you this ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #40:1>
Well , as you know I 'm not planning what I write just chatting on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #41:1>
I started because in writing that I felt you had been gentle and kind , I was reminded of &lsquo; patient and kind &rsquo; and then I include the rest for your interest and as it gives me pleasure to share the words of scripture with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #42:1>
Arn't Aren't I being serious ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #43:1>
( It 's late now ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #44:1>
Murray phoned when I was half way through the quote
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #45:1>
and I talked with him for ages . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #46:1>
I 'm looking forward to taking off my white clothes and curling beneath the sheets even though you 're not here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #47:1>
You are very present -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #48:1>
the room feels full of you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #49:1>
Your lack of inhibition fills the space ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #50:1>
The curtains are open and outside the yellow street lamp makes the leaves look brown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #51:1>
The heavy lorries are still trundling along on the A.1 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #52:1>
The room is hot and my feet are hot even though they are bare touching the light blue carpet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #53:1>
Don't feel that me writing to you creates an of obligation for you to respond .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #54:1>
If you don't want to write don't ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #55:1>
if you 'd like to , do .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #56:1>
FREEDOM !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #57:1>
Another good word .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #58:1>
Anyway my darling I shall stop at the bottom of this page .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #59:1>
I smile when I think of you saying &ldquo; Ah It 's Hot &rdquo; yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #60:1>
I was telling Pamela about the ice tonight and that she 'd have had a wrong impression if she 'd been here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #61:1>
She said &ldquo; What have you done to him ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #X62:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #63:1>
She flatters me to think that 's due to me wouldn't you say ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #64:1>
I 'm sending you this card to stand in your bedroom .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #65:1>
I know you said you 've never liked any of these cards only the one in your room at John 's , but you may like this a little bit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #66:1>
See the white doves ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #67:1>
And all the stone ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #68:1>
Cool to the touch , and I liked the mans man 's hair myself ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #69:1>
Enjoy yourself lots ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #70:1>
Work hard , eat well , keep smiling .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #71:1>
Lots of love ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #72:1>
Your friend , I .

Monday. 12.20 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #74:2>
Dear Bill ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #75:2>
Went out tonight with Eugenie , the French girl you spoke with at my party , Sheila and Katherine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #76:2>
I had intended to take them dancing and to hear Colin sing but they wanted to see a film so I was outnumbered .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #77:2>
We went to see a light period story , an adaptation of &ldquo; Where Angels fear to tread &rdquo; by E. M. Forester Forster .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #78:2>
It was about a woman in her 40's 40s who travels to Italy and marries an Italian .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #79:2>
It was beautifully filmed and with a subtle gentle plot and I enjoyed it very much .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #80:2>
Helena Bonham-Carter was in it , the actress that played Ophelia in Hamlet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #81:2>
She was again very good ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #82:2>
Anyway enough news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #83:2>
I felt good tonight once again dressed all in white wandering around Leicester Square with all the street musicians and the life .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #84:2>
I always think of all the people in the world who would love to come to London , live in London , our free city , and I remember to be thankful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #85:2>
On the other hand I long to travel , to get out of London , to go to America or just to see wide open unspoilt spaces .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #86:2>
To be filled with that sense of wonder and perspective as one always is when brought face to face with the majesty of creation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #87:2>
I 'm being serious again !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #88:2>
Its It 's the time of night you see .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #89:2>
When you write at 12.35 at night that 's what happens .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #90:2>
You get serious .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #91:2>
I also felt slightly bored ( a terrible confession ) with my friends tonight and wished I were with Julie , Jenny , David and Andy who I 'll be seeing next week , instead .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #92:2>
There 's something very special about seeing a film with someone ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #93:2>
you share the whole experience , live through it with them and I really wanted to see the film with you of course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #94:2>
I wonder how you are , reading a lot , talking a lot and enjoying yourself I 'm sure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #95:2>
You 'll get a letter from me tommorow tomorrow and no doubt be embarassed embarrassed when the lady gives it to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #96:2>
Which reminds me , do you want me to post your toothbrushes ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #97:2>
I wonder what the thoughts were , that were passing through your mind as you lay in bed earlier before you fell asleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #98:2>
If I had a recording of them would I be able to understand it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #99:2>
Today had been disjoined .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #100:2>
I had to spend 2 hours defrosting the freezer this morning as it had been left open .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #101:2>
I did yet more hand washing and yet more cleaning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #102:2>
Silvie kept me there 1 1/2 hours today and did <unclear-character> start complaining about the electricity board .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #103:2>
I told her I was in a hurry ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #104:2>
but I 've transformed her house while she 's taught Emily ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #105:2>
so , so far so good .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #106:2>
I didn't find my hour to study but I did 2 hours yesterday so I suppose I 'll have to be happy with that ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #107:2>
Have a lovely day my dear if you get this a. m.
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #108:2>
and if p. m. have a good evening and sweet dreams
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #109:2>

Hi Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #117:3>
Greetings from Tabairan Island .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #118:3>
Life in Malaysia is excellent .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #119:3>
My first project is on the dive site , and involves diving twice a day on some fantastic coral reefs .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #120:3>
We 're doing survey for the university here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #121:3>
We 've done some fun dives too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #122:3>
I did my first night dive the other day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #123:3>
I dived to 27m which was also a good experience -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #124:3>
It feels like you 're floating in space -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #125:3>
There 's so much water around you !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #126:3>
We now built a little home on the island including a bar &ampersand; a kitchen !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #127:3>
Have a great birthday -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #128:3>
looking forward to seeing you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #129:3>
Give my love to Simon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #130:3>
Lots of love

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #135:4>
Happy Birthday !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #136:4>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #137:4>
I trust you are well and enjoying your Summer work in academia .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #138:4>
My work is rather hectic at the moment with lots to do , especially as I 've been on my own in the office this week , and the firm is short staffed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #139:4>
Studying is progressing towards December exams -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #140:4>
I 'm at last registered as a certified student with , as expected , two exemptions from the Level 2 nine papers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #141:4>
Has Simon sat his exams yet ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #142:4>
My cricket umpiring has been enjoyable although the travelling to S. London and Surrey is rather tiring .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #143:4>
I 've obtained a report from a qualified umpire and have submitted this with my application for full membership so will hopefully become qualified when the passing committee sits in November .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #144:4>
I was <unclear-word> going on holiday to Slovenia but HF ( the walking hols. co ) cancelled this last weekend .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #145:4>
Instead , I 'm going to Le Bettese in France near Mont. Mont Blanc and the Swiss (
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #146:4>
we fly to Geneva ) &ampersand; Italian borders .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #147:4>
This is a mixed age group party rather than the planned 17-35 but will hopefully still be a much needed enjoyable relaxing break .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #148:4>
Well that 's all my news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #149:4>
Regards to Simon
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #150:4>
See you on the 10th in Haverhill

Dear David ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #154:5>
Your letter to Amon Hen suggesting why I thought shelob is an English word is quite correct .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #155:5>
I realized after writing the letter to Tony Curtis that I must have thought of shelob as morphologically parallel to she-devil , she-goat , and so on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #156:5>
Perhaps such a derivation is what the Tolkien letter you refer to rules out (
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #157:5>
I don't have access access to the Tolkien letters ) .

Thanks for all your letters and other biological evidences !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #163:6>
Glad everything 's over and all went OK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #164:6>
We had an open day today , which me I &ampersand; the KCSU chairperson ( Alice , 2nd year ) organized which was good fun -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #165:6>
tropical weather too ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #166:6>
so ace to go on tour and things !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #167:6>
Have just had a note from our Admissions tutor thanking me for all my &lsquo; energetic and friendly work &rsquo; -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #168:6>
so ner to Hendiepoos !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #169:6>
Anyway , tell me if you want to come to the June event on Thurs 13th June ,

<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #171:6>
they 're selling now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #172:6>
It should be ace , but it 's up to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #173:6>
Liz &ampersand; Nikki are coming up/down too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #174:6>
Hopefully I 'm going to the Trinity Ball for FREE - which would be ace -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #175:6>
Peter has promised to get me in but I 'll believe it when it comes , as it 's so meggarly policed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #176:6>
Had my travel grant interview at Trin - yesterday eve -
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #177:6>
two v. anthropological bea guys , one with beard and no moustache .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #178:6>
They were nice , but I could hear the pretentious bitch before me detailing her conquest of the world .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #179:6>
Being Trinity , they probably liked that !
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #180:6>
Anyway , see you Sat .
<ICE-GB:W1B-006 #181:6>
Have fun - lots of love , Ellie XXX

Wed. 2. AM .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #2:1>
Dearest ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #3:1>
Wish you were here ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #4:1>
Today has been awful apart from your voice on the phone and 30 mins piano practice with Emily .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #5:1>
The police told me they could check Pam 's Mums Mum 's baggage without having to speak to her so I agreed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #6:1>
What they actually did was send 6 huge C.I.D. men to say that I 'd accused her of stealing the video and that I was no friend of hers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #7:1>
So now I 've got high drama from Pamela about her mother being &ldquo; humiliated in front of the entire airport . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #8:1>
And no doubt the entire African community will know by this time tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #9:1>
The irony is , as Linda pointed out , it 's me that 's ended up as the criminal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #10:1>
I 'm actually glad I had her stopped as now I 'm sure it wasn't her but Pamela won't see that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #11:1>
The other thing is that it was actually Linda who said , &ldquo; You can get a lot for a video in South Africa &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #12:1>
until she said that it hadn't even crossed my mind but of course I can't say that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #13:1>
I can't say &ldquo; Actually it was Linda ... &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #14:1>
I promised you a funny letter today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #15:1>
I still don't know how they got in and how , especially if they had a key ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #16:1>
Sadly it could still be one of Pams Pam 's relatives or Pam 's Mam could have passed it on -
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #17:1>
I don't know ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #18:1>
what else can I think ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #19:1>
It was great to hear your reaction to my letters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #20:1>
I was afraid you wouldn't want to be embarrased embarrassed and that you 'd feel pressurized by all these words .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #21:1>
But you were all smiles ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #22:1>
like a happy little boy you sounded .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #23:1>
I wouldn't mind being searched at all ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #24:1>
I 'd better sleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #25:1>
It 's late , I feel awful and all this will start again tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #26:1>
Thanks for existing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #27:1>
It makes such a difference having you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #28:1>
Love Love Love Love and More Love

P. S .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #31:1>
While Pam 's Mum is busy being offended I am &pound-sign;540 worse off ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #32:1>
I 'd rather be humiliated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #33:2>
Thursday 12.50 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #34:2>
Early Tonight !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #35:2>
1.30 signing off time ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #36:2>
Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #37:2>
There is something really satisfying in a clean pair of cotton pyjamas especially when you can find both parts and they match .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #38:2>
Today has been slightly less of a nightmare although not much .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #39:2>
I had expected the day to begin with a phone call from Pam 's Mum but she hasn't rung at all which is worse .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #40:2>
I was woken first by another relation who sounded like Pam 's Mum and just kept saying &ldquo; Can I speak to Pamela ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #41:2>
I asked if it was Pams Pam 's Mum and she just said again &ldquo; Can I speak to Pamela ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #42:2>
So I presumed it was her , too angry to speak to me , so I apo started to apologise in full after which
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #43:2>
she kept saying Yes , Yes , and ended up with &ldquo; Can I speak to Pamela ? &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #44:2>
Of course then it wasn't Pam 's Mum at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #45:2>
Then Linda rang and advised me not to Fax the apology to Africa before considering the contents in case she tries to sue me for deformation defamation of character .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #46:2>
So later on I phoned to complain to the police who after all had told me she wouldn't be spoken to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #47:2>
They said I acted perfectly correctly as I had an obligation to rule out possible suspects .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #48:2>
I also spoke to my solicitor who told me she 'd have no grounds .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #49:2>
Pamela has just said &ldquo; They 'll be writing to you &rdquo; and is looking at me tonight like I 'm the criminal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #50:2>
However I happened to notice tonight that she said &ldquo; I thought it was hired &rdquo; ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #51:2>
But I don't know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #52:2>
The finger prints officer came but of course there was nothing to take prints off so that was a great help .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #53:2>
The locksmith called by to advise me about obligations to lock chubs chubbs at night and said it would have been pretty well impossible to get in without a key .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #54:2>
So ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #55:2>
Any ideas ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #56:2>
Meanwhile I 've phoned all the garages in North London and no-one has any second-hand mini's minis apart from in red .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #57:2>
I don't want red .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #58:2>
Hang on
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #59:2>
I 'm going to chub chubb lock the front door
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #60:2>
I 'm feeling totally paranoid .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #61:2>
Eva has asked me to go out with her tommorow tomorrow ( To see a film ! ) but I hardly dare leave the house !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #62:2>
Meanwhile - (
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #63:2>
Yes the repetition is deliberate )
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #64:2>
it was Silvie 's birthday today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #65:2>
I felt obliged to ask her back for tea and she stayed till 11.30 pm so that ruled out my studying yet again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #66:2>
It 's awful ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #67:2>
just one hour a day makes such a difference .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #68:2>
Next week with Julie it will be impossible to do anything at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #69:2>
Meanwhile I go to pick up my results tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #70:2>
I don't even dare to write what the best and the worst I can expect it is .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #71:2>
But out of 5 subjects if I don't have 3 A's As I 'll be disappointed so I guess I 'll probably be disappointed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #72:2>
A friend has asked to me to meet her at 12 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #73:2>
I have to wait till then !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #74:2>
Eva won't go in -
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #75:2>
She 's putting off the shock as long as possible !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #76:2>
Meanwhile I miss you , I miss you , I miss you
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #77:2>
x I .

<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #83:3>
Friday 12.30 midnight
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #84:3>
Dear Thing ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #85:3>
You seem to have been away 100 years .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #86:3>
You won't get this letter till monday Monday by which time I 'll now no doubt have spoken to you , but never mind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #87:3>
This is the record of how I 'm feeling tonight .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #88:3>
Thank you my love for all your help and encouragement during my revision which enabled me to get my work to a standard where I could get a 3 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #89:3>
It means a lot to me . sentence
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #90:3>
Anyway to the other results ... yes I am disappointed ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #91:3>
I wanted 3 - 3 's 3s and 2 - 7's 7s at least -
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #92:3>
What I got was 2 3's 3s and a borderline A/B1 a &ldquo; 4 &rdquo; and a 7 and an 8 which is a borderline B1/B2 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #93:3>
I could only have hoped for B1's B1s for French but the 7 is a major disappointment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #94:3>
This was the French Literature paper where I thought I 'd done so well as I answered the question so completely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #95:3>
Apparently what I did wrong , ( I saw one of the teacher's teachers today , ) , is I wrote about the novel by referring to the author and the life and thoughts of the author .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #96:3>
She tells me today I should have considered the text only &ldquo; as if I 'd found it in the desert &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #97:3>
This was absolutely the first time she 'd said this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #98:3>
I did write a good essay she said but I had broken an ( unspoken ) rule .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #99:3>
Apparently another student who wrote the same essay made the same &ldquo; mistake &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #100:3>
But you can't say &ldquo; This is the first time I 've heard this ... &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #101:3>
So for French Lit instead of a 5 , 6 , or 7 I ended up with 8 when I 'd had 3 sixs sixes for coursework and I thought my exam would bring my mark way up ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #102:3>
Ah well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #103:3>
So if I want a first I 've got to get 3 A's As next year ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #104:3>
Sweat ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #105:3>
Anyway I suppose with 2 3's 3s and a 4 in my major subject I should be very happy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #106:3>
Eva 's marks which I picked up for her where were 16 , 14 , 9 , 10 and 10 , so I suppose I shouldn't complain !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #107:3>
Today was taken up with washing , ironing , cleaning tidying e.t.c !
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #108:3>
Syvie Sylvie came here today to teach Emily so that was great .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #109:3>
I also did one hour in the garden and cut the grass .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #110:3>
Then tonight Eva was desperate to see &ldquo; La Gloire de Mon Pere &rdquo; and Emily to see it again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #111:3>
So we went again and I tried to avoid the subtitles .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #112:3>
Then we , Eva Emily and I , went to this restaurant where there was a Grand Piano ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #113:3>
the entertainer was playing popular themes and when he went for his tea break we persuaded Emily to play .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #114:3>
She played her &ldquo; Minstrel Showboat &rdquo; the one you said sounded Chinese for about 100 people and she was so sweet and played without a single mistake she was so charming , wearing a little black and white skirt and top Marie Helene had given her and her hair all plaited
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #115:3>
she was wonderful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #116:3>
I really miss you tonight. <unclear-words>
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #117:3>
I 'm sorry I missed hearing your voice tonight .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #118:3>
Still ... Murray and Julie arrive Sunday ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #119:3>
maybe they 'll distract me for a while .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #120:3>
I miss you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #121:3>
xxxxxxx I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #122:4>
Thursday 12.00 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #123:4>
Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #124:4>
So you are coming home tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #125:4>
I won't have to write to you tommorow tomorrow night as you 'll be here to hold , to touch .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #126:4>
I would hold my breath if your arrival could be speeded up by doing so .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #127:4>
But for me there is still tonight the chance to talk to you in this easy way .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #128:4>
The joy of writing is that you have to just proceed with the assumption that you are being understood .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #129:4>
I can't see the look of confusion on your face and there are many things it is far easier to write than say .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #130:4>
If I can I 'll try and teach you this freedom of the pen , the flow of thoughts directly on to paper without the help of Chomsky .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #131:4>
I long for your skin on mine , your face touching mine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #132:4>
Do I embarass embarrass you when I write like that ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #133:4>
Do you consider it counts as writing sweet nothings ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #134:4>
What about your thoughts my dear ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #135:4>
Are they really so well ordered as all that ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #136:4>
If you were to just write as I do - The the mass of jumbled thoughts and feelings that go round in your head - what would come out then ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #137:4>
That 's how I would like to know you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #138:4>
Like I once described it , to be allowed to enter , to dance amongst your pieces of broken Chinese porcelain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #139:4>
A bit of this , a bit of that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #140:4>
Yes , you let me in through touch but unless you can teach me your freedom under your white sheet and I can teach you mine on the white sheet ( Oh dear a bit too clever ! ) <unclear-words>
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #141:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #142:4>
I will be away from the 17th August to the 9th of September so somehow if you want to be with me during that time I have to share this magic with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #143:4>
When you pick up a pen time and distance are powerless .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #144:4>
As I write you read
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #145:4>
I am writing this and you are reading it - Aren't you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #146:4>
Where has have the time and the distance gone ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #147:4>
I have defeated them , these 2 old enemies of lovers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #148:4>
I don't want them to stand between us as they are very strong and subtle .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #149:4>
They increase the distance between lovers without the lovers even noticing sometimes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #150:4>
Like an anti magnetic anti-magnetic force field but you can't feel it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #151:4>
The pen though , as Shakespeare will tell you is more Mighty than the sword .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #152:4>
For me it is like a time machine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #153:4>
I can be with you tonight and share myself with you so freely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #154:4>
Try and learn the joy of this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #155:4>
Just as I have so much to learn tommorow tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #156:4>
I 'm always frightened of disappointing you , of not doing what you want and I know you wouldn't want me to feel like that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #157:4>
And no more would I have you lift a pen with anything less than joy in knowing you can write anything just as I can do anything when I 'm with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-007 #158:4>
I love your intensity and I thank you for accepting mine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #1:1>
Tuesday
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #2:1>
No idea what time it is !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #3:1>
Darling ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #4:1>
Yes I feel as if I 'm writing to someone else tonight , the <unclear-word> of the video as I 've just finished showing the tape to Julie .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #5:1>
As I anticipated it made me feel all guyey about you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #6:1>
Actually I 'm not sure how you spell guey .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #7:1>
Ah - Inspiration
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #8:1>
goo ( as in zoo ) z
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #9:1>
gooey .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #10:1>
Of course ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #11:1>
So I was forced to read your letter through again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #12:1>
I wish it was the weekend ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #13:1>
I think it 's next tuesday Tuesday ( or something ) I go away to stay with friends , did you remember ? ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #14:1>
This afternoon Andy came &ampersand; took Julie and the boys off to Hampstead Heath
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #15:1>
and Em and I went off to Silvie 's for an <unclear-characters> hour
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #16:1>
so Em got her work done ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #17:1>
but not me of course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #18:1>
Saturday after I spoke to you though I did an hour and I also found an hour on Sunday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #19:1>
Thursday afternoon 'll be my next chance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #20:1>
Saw you glance at the camera tonight -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #21:1>
didn't notice it first time through .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #22:1>
Strangely I feel like you do tonight ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #23:1>
I just want to be with you - as if I can't write , I can't say whatever there is to say as I don't know what it is ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #24:1>
all that feeling .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #25:1>
I think I 'm just very very tired .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #26:1>
God 's blessing on you , your family and on us , too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #27:1>
OOO
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #28:1>
OOO
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #29:1>
These are hugs by the way , did you know that ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #30:1>
I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #31:2>
Wed. 1.50 am .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #32:2>
Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #33:2>
A day of hectic activity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #34:2>
Julie and I took Emily and her 2 boys who are aged 5 and nearly 3 swimming this morning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #35:2>
Emily demonstrated a much improved breast stroke legs and her 2 screamed and wailed and wanted to get out !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #36:2>
The younger calmed down eventually ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #37:2>
the older one is very nervous .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #38:2>
This afternoon we took them down to the Polka Children 's Theatre in Wimbledon which was a great success .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #39:2>
Tonight Emily has gone off with her Dad .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #40:2>
The 2 boys eventually got off to sleep about 9.30 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #41:2>
I 'd love to work at Polka sometime in the future .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #42:2>
I hope I can perform again somewhere , sometime , somehow ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #43:2>
Tonight Julie and I talked and chatted ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #44:2>
she is one of my most favourite friends .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #45:2>
I wish you 'd been able to be here this week and meet all these favorite favourite people of mine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #46:2>
But you 've met Murray and he 's a good start .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #47:2>
I 'm sitting here in bed now in your turquoise T. shirt with the hole in and thinking of the expression you have on your face when you rub the skin , on your face
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #48:2>
while I 'm putting on my potions ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #49:2>
I 'd like to be with you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #50:2>
why can't I be like that ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #51:2>
I need so much help my dear .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #52:2>
Be patient with me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #53:2>
How is the happy God of Wisdom ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #54:2>
How are the intense Japanese ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #55:2>
How is the good-looking Chinese and when is he coming home ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #56:2>
Perhaps you could ask him to drop me a line and tell me ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #57:2>
Algy is lying on my bed making that noise you don't like .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #58:2>
My eyes have closed in spite of the fact my pen is still moving .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #59:2>
I keep having to stop to open them again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #60:2>
Can't write anymore ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #61:2>
Love you xx I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #62:3>
Hello Francoise ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #63:3>
I was so glad to receive your nice letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #64:3>
So glad to remember the way you speak .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #65:3>
( I 'm not joking . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #66:3>
I hope (
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #67:3>
I know ) you are managing to remain positive and cheerful through your studies , regardless of any setbacks caused by inept and strange teachers like Mr &lsquo; C &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #68:3>
You .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #69:3>
How are you and how is Paris ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #70:3>
Both warm and vibrant
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #71:3>
I hope .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #72:3>
I miss Paris and I miss you !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #73:3>
We never spoke much , though that doesn't really matter as words are often inappropriate when in the presence of feeling .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #74:3>
Having said that there are one or two things I want to tell you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #75:3>
and for the moment the only way I can express them is through this letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #76:3>
I would much prefer to tell you one-to-one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #77:3>
Anyway , prepare yourself :
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #78:3>
You are special , because you are you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #79:3>
You are beautiful , because you are you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #80:3>
You are lovable , and I ..........
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #81:3>
You are unique , inspiring , and talented too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #82:3>
are you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #83:3>
You probably didn't expect me to say such things Francoise , but I needed to say them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #84:3>
I could say more ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #85:3>
a part of me wants to ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #86:3>
but there 's no need for me to embroider or elaborate on my words ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #87:3>
that would ruin the genuineness of my feelings .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #88:3>
I will change the subject now and tell you something different .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #89:3>
I 'm thinking of coming to Paris soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #90:3>
I would like to see you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #91:3>
My studies finish around the 15th of June .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #92:3>
Then I have a three-month holiday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #93:3>
You said to me once you might come to London to visit ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #94:3>
come .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #95:3>
A friend of mine has an exhibition of African textiles , prayer rugs and carpets in Paris in June , somewhere near the Picasso Museum
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #96:3>
I think .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #97:3>
I will get details from him soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #98:3>
I might be there - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #99:3>
you might be interested to go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #100:3>
Like you , studying is taking up a lot of my time ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #101:3>
it is important but it isn't everything .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #102:3>
I am writing this letter to you on a Saturday night or early Sunday morning ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #103:3>
my room faces a park ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #104:3>
it is silent outside except for the sound of a night owl .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #105:3>
I am very tired and will now go to sleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #106:3>
I think of you and hope that you will write to me soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #107:3>
Sean .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #108:4>
Dear Anne-Marie ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #109:4>
My apologies for not writing to you sooner .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #110:4>
I said to you that I would write soon after our telephone conversation , but I haven't .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #111:4>
All I can say is that things have been rather hetic hectic here in London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #112:4>
As you know I have , like you , been caught up in completing exams and coursework .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #113:4>
They have taken most of my time &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #114:4>
in fact , this year has been the hardest year in terms of mental ( academic ) strain that I have had to go through .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #115:4>
College work aside , I have just ended this strange relationship with the girl we spoke about in Paris .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #116:4>
The strain of ending this relationship during my most important exams has taken its toll .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #117:4>
However , all this is in the past .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #118:4>
What is now important is to get on with life , learning to ride with the punches and take advantage of opportunities .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #119:4>
When we spoke we did not say very much - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #120:4>
it was difficult to say anything I know - - given that I had not been in contact with you for so long .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #121:4>
I have not forgotten you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #122:4>
how could I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #123:4>
You are such a gentle , caring and unique person , with so many likable traits and gestures , someone who doesn't deserve to be treated the way I have treated you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #124:4>
I cannot blame anyone nor or anything for my actions and circumstances ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #125:4>
I must accept the conditions I find myself in .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #126:4>
I did not plan for things to happen the way they have &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #127:4>
being in France was a new and powerful experience for me - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #128:4>
I had some very enjoyable moments there , as well as some that were less enjoyable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #129:4>
The time we spent together was very enjoyable , even though it was very brief .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #130:4>
I would like to hear from you - - to hear what you think about our present situations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #131:4>
I don't really know how to proceed &semi; how to regard our future relationship , and depending on what that relationship is , whether that great invention the Channel will come between us , emotionally not just physically .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #132:4>
Today is Sunday the 30th of June , and I had intended to visit Paris before now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #133:4>
I am still here in London and will be here at least for the next few weeks , if not longer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #134:4>
I have to work to earn some much needed cash .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #135:4>
When my finances are more stable I will visit Paris .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #136:4>
Having said that I am going to try to raise enough money to come over for a weekend very soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #137:4>
Anne-Marie , please let me know what you think about all of this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #138:4>
I would love to hear from you , not to mention at some pont point , see you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #139:4>
All my love and wishes ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #140:4>
Sean .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #141:5>
Dear Lydia and Valaria ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #142:5>
I 'm sorry that I haven't written to you sooner .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #143:5>
Life has been hetic hectic here in London - - exams , accomodation accommodation and so on - - leaving me little time to do the other important things in life like maintaining relationships with friends .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #144:5>
I think of you both from time to time , wondering what your you 're up to in Italy and how your you 're coping with your new abode and surroundings .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #145:5>
I hope everything has turned out well for you both , and I am sure you 've had no trouble with passing your courses .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #146:5>
Life in London is somewhat of a an anti-climax after the sights and sounds of Paris - - the people , the places , the food , ( especially the food at Nanterre ! ? ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #147:5>
Strangely enough I miss the paradise of Nanterre very much .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #148:5>
Whatever its downside may have been there were many times which made up for it &semi; especially those times when we all got together for a bite to eat , for a drink and a chat ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #149:5>
ah !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #150:5>
those were the days ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #151:5>
gone but not forgotten .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #152:5>
I have written to Nordine and some of the others who were at Nantere Nanterre ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #153:5>
they all seem to be doing well , and all have some fond memories of Nanterre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #154:5>
It would be good to see you both again ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #155:5>
so do let me know when you 're back in London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #156:5>
And if you plan to stay in Italy a while longer or travel around further send me your address ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #157:5>
you never know ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #158:5>
I might come and visit you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #159:5>
My very best wishes to you both ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #160:5>
take care .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #161:5>
Sean .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #162:6>
Dear Anne-flo ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #163:6>
How are you keeping yourself back in sunny Paris where the food is good ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #164:6>
and And the people even better ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #165:6>
Well , your you 're not too bad !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #166:6>
This letter is hand-written , in a style suited for the occasion , on expensive paper with a fine pen , and yet it 's still probably bullshit ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #167:6>
It has been a while since we spoke ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #168:6>
but not too long for me to forget you - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #169:6>
how could I forget you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #170:6>
The little Dog who roamed into my life for some fun , but was soon to run ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #171:6>
and yet she 's still to come .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #172:6>
I am fine , learning to learn etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #173:6>
And you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #174:6>
how are things now after the great fortune you 've collected from your market-stall work ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #175:6>
perhaps you will retire now to the country , or perhaps your you 're considering becoming a full-time market-stall trader .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #176:6>
I can just see you now chatting up the customers , winking an eye now and again , talking the talk .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #177:6>
Pure Anne-flo .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #178:6>
I hope life is being kind to you and you kind to yourself .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #179:6>
My exams are over at last .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #180:6>
I feel relieved and am glad it 's over for a while .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #181:6>
Now I am settling down in my new flat in a very nice part of central London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #182:6>
The rent costs next to nothing and the area is superb - -
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #183:6>
about time too !
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #184:6>
It wont won't be too long before you come over , will it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #185:6>
I 'm sure you 'll like Sutton
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #186:6>
it 's quite nice ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #187:6>
in fact , it 's nice but a bit quite quiet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #188:6>
You 're going to have a good time here , I know it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #189:6>
You will , you know , make many friends .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #190:6>
And , as I told you before , should you need a hand with anything , be sure to call me up .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #191:6>
It will be good to see you again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #192:6>
Please write and let me know your plans and thoughts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #193:6>
Love and wishes ,

Dear Simon and Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #197:7>
Hope you won't mind my writing to you - but having recovered from the &ldquo; farewell &rdquo; on Friday , and I really thought there would only be those present working on that day , on donation desks - I was overwhelmed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #198:7>
I did dash off a letter to the donations office and one for everyone now working in donations &semi; late on Friday evening ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #199:7>
but I did want you both to know how very much I appreciated the party .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #200:7>
Perhaps Laura you can reinforce my thanks to all , and also Simon , as I cannot write to everyone .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #201:7>
Shall use some of the generous money to buy the Dickens biography by Peter Ackroyd , and that should last me until Christmas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #202:7>
I thought the signed card was marvellous and have taken it all in , - which I couldn't do on Friday ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #203:7>
I loved the late donation from Queenie (
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #204:7>
whose idea was that ? )
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #205:7>
Well my thanks to both of you
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #206:7>
and do come over perhaps in December , if you could manage it , for coffee one morning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #207:7>
Love and affection to you both and all your animals .
<ICE-GB:W1B-008 #208:7>
Yours ever , Peter - and Jemima and Plopsie

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #3:1>
I wonder if you have got any of my letters by now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #4:1>
No one else has .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #5:1>
Actually I think they are probably still in the postbox where I posted them over a week ago .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #6:1>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #7:1>
How 's the job going ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #8:1>
Have you had any news as far as the British Academy is concerned ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #9:1>
Well we have had , at last ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #10:1>
our boiler mended and so have a dribble of hot water .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #11:1>
Today I haven't been very busy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #12:1>
I did some washing , washed my hair and then went for something to eat .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #13:1>
At the moment I 'm waiting for ten o'clock to come so I can go and phone Antonio .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #14:1>
As I am in such a mood with the &ldquo; married &rdquo; , I 'm not evening even bothering to send them postcards .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #15:1>
I hope they feel put out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #16:1>
We are now beginning to settle down and there is loads to do .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #17:1>
Yesterday we went on one cable car up to the mountain and then across the port in another for some fish and seafood . SCHULZ
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #18:1>
I can't say my Spanish is improving as I haven't met any Spanish people .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #19:1>
They are very helpful to foreigners ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #20:1>
if I thought the Italians were into staring , but they have eyes on stalks here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #21:1>
I 've also never seen so many groping couples .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #22:1>
The other day at the beach there was a lot of serious grinding going on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #23:1>
I didn't know where to look ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #24:1>
Our project at the uni. seems quite difficult .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #25:1>
I really don't understand what 's going on
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #26:1>
the others seem to be zooming ahead .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #27:1>
Anyhow I 'm having a good time so I 'm not thinking about work .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #28:1>
I have discovered a few nice jewellery shops and also that shoes are really cheap so I may have to purchase before I go home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #29:1>
Anyhow I haven't much more news so I 'll finish this in the week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #30:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #31:1>
Hi again !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #32:1>
It is now Wednesday - I think and exceedingly hot .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #33:1>
Actually today I 'm nursing a very bad hangover so I decided I had better stay at home rather than throw up on the metro ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #34:1>
Our project is not getting very far very fast as we can't understand what this Spanish guy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #35:1>
I can get some of what he says but not everything and the other two can't understand a word at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #36:1>
I have asked him for a written outline of the project so I can bring it home and translate it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #37:1>
They are also annoying because they keep asking this guy to speak English which is not what we are here for .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #38:1>
Anyhow enough moaning and groaning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #39:1>
On Monday I took my camera for a walk to the park near us and took loads of photos .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #40:1>
We live very near to the bull-ring and not far from a skating rink would you believe it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #41:1>
It seems strange that there is an ice-rink in the middle of such a hot , dusty city .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #42:1>
Yesterday we went up another mountain on the tram - Mount Tibidales .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #43:1>
It was gorgeous up there because it was so cold infact in fact by the time I came home I was actually freezing cold and goose pimply .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #44:1>
I have at last received some post .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #45:1>
Two letters from my mum and one from my Dad .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #46:1>
It seems I have been accepted to do the open competition exam for Brussels so I will have to start swotting for that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #47:1>
Boring .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #48:1>
I will just think of the money .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #49:1>
I am looking forward to Antonio arriving ( all being ) well ) on 13th .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #50:1>
It will be nice to see him and also to have some new company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #51:1>
I like Sarah who I 'm sharing with but am not too keen on some of the others who are here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #52:1>
I haven't decided what I 'm going to do at the weekend .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #53:1>
There appears to be a Barcelona equivalent of Camden Market so I may go and check that out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #54:1>
I can't think of anymore any more news for the moment so be good(ish!) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #55:1>
See you soon maybe !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #56:1>
Write soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #57:1>
Lots of love to you , Simon &ampersand; Fleur .

Swoo !

<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #60:2>
Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #61:2>
Hi !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #62:2>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #63:2>
Is it hot in London ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #64:2>
It is abolutely boiling here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #65:2>
At the moment I 'm not having a particularly good time -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #66:2>
I don't really know why as there is plenty to do in the city but I am for the first time ever a bit homesick .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #67:2>
I have to say our flat is not particularly nice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #68:2>
It is very hot , noisy and cramped .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #69:2>
We are also waiting for hot water and the kitchen seems to have the odd beetle or ten ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #70:2>
Anyhow there is nothing I can do about it so I 'll just have to make the best of it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #71:2>
Antonio is coming to rescue me on the 13th August .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #72:2>
I think he will stay for about ten days .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #73:2>
I don't know what you want to do about coming to visit as I can only say you would not be having a holiday but a course in survival .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #74:2>
I suggest you wait till September when it will be much , much cooler .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #75:2>
August is apparently the worst time to come when it is even hotter and stickier than it is now . SCHULZ
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #76:2>
But enough moans .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #77:2>
Our journey here was a nightmare .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #78:2>
The plane was 4 hours late .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #79:2>
Luckily we hadn't lost our room in the pension .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #80:2>
We did actually find this flat on our first day here so that was lucky and we also couldn't afford to be choosy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #81:2>
There is a shortage of accommodation here due to the impending Olympics .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #82:2>
We couldn't afford to keep staying in pension whilst we looked .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #83:2>
On Wednesday we went to Sitges - the most popular gay resort in Spain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #84:2>
It was not as gay as I had imagined -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #85:2>
I was expecting men in thongs hovering in doorways ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #86:2>
It was actually really pretty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #87:2>
I went wandering on Friday -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #88:2>
I don't start working till Monday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #89:2>
Unfortunately Lorraine one of the others had her bag stolen .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #90:2>
Judging by the queue at the police station it had been a busy and profitable day for the thieves .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #91:2>
Antonio was really lucky to get a ticket to come as it seems that everyone wants to go to Spain or Portugal as Yugoslavia is now a no-go area .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #92:2>
He has to fly from Brindisi to Rome , Rome to Milan and then Milan to Barcelona .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #93:2>
There 's dedication for you ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #94:2>
Have you heard anything from the British Academy ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #95:2>
Are they going to pay you lots and lots of money ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #96:2>
I hope so ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #97:2>
What else have you been doing ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #98:2>
How 's the survey going ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #99:2>
I have to say I 'm missing all my friends ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #100:2>
I think sharing with Sarah may be a mistake as she 's very used to living on her own and it shows .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #101:2>
I can't think of much more news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #102:2>
Write soon -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #103:2>
my address is : - CARRER DE LA DIPUTACI&Oacute; 418 , 5 o 4 a , Barcelona SPAIN .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #104:2>
I don't know if you will still want to visit
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #105:2>
there certainly is not room for you and Simon - unfortunately and all I can say is much as I would love to see you if it were me I would rather spend the money on something else given what a cramped flat we have .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #106:2>
BUT please don't think I don't want you to come .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #107:2>
I will leave the decision up to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #108:2>
Anyhow my flat is about 10 minutes walk away from this church which is really impressive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #109:2>
It is also always surrounded by tourists blocking the pavement , staring heaven<l>wards with their mouths open ! ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #110:2>
Anyhow - write soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #111:2>
Am missing our gossip with love from Swoo ! xxxx

<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #116:3>
Dear Laura &ampersand; Simon ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #117:3>
Enclosed is a bus timetable for London to Haverhill .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #118:3>
Hope it 's useful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #119:3>
Are you going to stay over ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #120:3>
You know you 're welcome &ampersand; the last No.38 leaves Haverhill at 3 pm !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #121:3>
Alternative route is to get National Express to Cambridge &ampersand; then Cambus ( of which I can give you details if necessary ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #122:3>
If you come by No.38 , remember to get out at Haverhill or you 'll go to prison .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #123:3>
If possible , could we please have our Locoscript 2 disc back ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #124:3>
I must remember to give you your linguistics books back , Laura .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #125:3>
See you next week , .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #126:3>
Lots of love ,

Hi Laura !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #132:4>
Congratulations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #133:4>
You deserved a 1st .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #134:4>
I didn't deserve to pass , but I 'm not complaining .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #135:4>
Just think , we 'll all be wearing black gowns &ampersand; flat hats and receiving a roll of parchment and then we 'll be really famous and I 'll be Jane Miriam Osborne BA ( if my pen behaves )
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #136:4>
when 's the ceremony ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #137:4>
I 've heard nothing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #138:4>
I hope we 're all together otherwise it won't be so much fun .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #139:4>
Also I heard that each graduate can only bring 2 guests .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #140:4>
I hope it 's more than that -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #141:4>
I 've promised everyone I 've met since my result that I 'll invite them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #142:4>
Adrian sent me a letter from USA .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #143:4>
I was quite pleased because he promise promised to write 2 yrs ago when we both went on camp to America .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #144:4>
It sounds like hard work but I bet he 's doing a great job .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #145:4>
The reason this writing is awful is because my landlord has not provided a table yet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #146:4>
The reason I have a new landlord is cos I 'm starting work in Finchley today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #147:4>
( Its It 's 7.00 am and I can't sleep ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #148:4>
Are you still working in the English Dept . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #149:4>
when When do you start your PHD ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #150:4>
Where in the country ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #151:4>
Keep me informed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #152:4>
I may be able to see you in central London -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #153:4>
weekends are best - or evenings .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #154:4>
Of course , if you 're willing to brave venturing north of the N. Circular , you 're welcome here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #155:4>

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #160:5>
How 's the English research going then ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #161:5>
( Ha , hit the right one this time , surely ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #162:5>
you heard yet from the Brit. Academy ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #163:5>
Apparently the B. Acad. is massively cutting down s down on its funding of the B. sch , ( so much so that milk is whisked away off the table after breakfast , and you have to haggle to make a cup of coffee ) , so hopefully that 's more for PHDs , altho &rsquo; of course bad for this place .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #164:5>
Got back to Athens at 10 pm yesterday , and went to this museum again today -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #165:5>
wonderful chandalier chandelier earrings -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #166:5>
this ship is the bottom half of one ( -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #167:5>
altho ' it calls it a pendant , I found a pair of earrings which look like it anyway . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #168:5>
So , off to Mavrommati this eve .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #169:5>
We saw some good sights &ampersand; sites in the South , altho ' there wasn't enough time and money to visit a couple of obscure ones , Nestor 's palace and the Bassae temple , so will make a forray foray ( strange Islamic spelling ? ) there another time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #170:5>
The places we did go to were all different of course - the temple of Aphaea on Aegina secluded and up high , the remains at Sparta a scramble thro ' dingy undergrowth in a valley , and Olympia swarming with twenty year olds at the Youth Hostel , <unclear-word> and a well-planned , well-funded museum .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #171:5>
Now 3 weeks with British Academics seem an odd prospect .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #172:5>
At the moment the others going on the trip are sheltering inside away from the foreign sun , but it 's not actually that hot today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #173:5>
Here , Liz is absorbed in her diary , and is still as pale as an English Latin teacher abroad , altho' we 've been swimming and everything .
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #174:5>
Granny Ingrams , as I call her !
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #175:5>
Hope Simey is well &ampersand; his ( cough cough ) exams were OK -
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #176:5>
Have a happy birthday , ( and hope you get some jewellery like this ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #177:5>
Lots of love ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-009 #178:5>

Dearest D. B.
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #2:1>
Monday eve .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #3:1>
Just spoken to you on the phone and heard your news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #4:1>
Life seems so cruel sometimes doesn't it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #5:1>
I remember when I watched my mother die , I was just 18 not feeling frightened or upset at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #6:1>
I felt strongly that I was just watching a change taking place .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #7:1>
It was so obvious that what was happening to the piece of flesh was nothing to do with the personality I knew as my mother .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #8:1>
wh Also I 'm sure this was not one of the experiences that went towards making me a Christian , as she lived and died an Atheist .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #9:1>
There wasn't any faith in watching death .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #10:1>
It just wasn't an end ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #11:1>
it didn't even look like one or feel like one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #12:1>
As well as this , and I 'm sure you 've felt this , there is the feeling of the love and feelings that a person has for you being more real after they 've died .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #13:1>
Their presence is greater and not diminished .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #14:1>
I don't write this at all in a sentimental or spiritual way , simply as a matter of fact , or at least as I experienced it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #15:1>
As to grief , I didn't cry at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #16:1>
All these words are very inappropriate I realise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #17:1>
I would much rather just be with you and say nothing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #18:1>
To walk and say nothing and sit by the fire and say nothing and perhaps to listen if you want to talk .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #19:1>
But what can a letter offer but words ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #20:1>
C. S. Lewis wrote after the death of his wife in his book about his own bereavement &ldquo; A grief observed &rdquo; - &lsquo; I never knew grief felt so much like fear ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #21:1>
When you said you have a problem with grief and bereavement ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #22:1>
What do you expect of yourself ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #23:1>
Most of the time I remember I felt nothing at all ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #24:1>
And I remember sometimes wishing that I could cry because all the emotion feels bottled up and trapped inside .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #25:1>
Often if you start with anger , if that 's what you feel , the tears follow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #26:1>
Bereavement is so ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #27:1>
yes it does feel like fear .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #28:1>
Better stop now ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #29:1>
all my words feel clumsy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #30:1>
I send you lots and lots of love my friend , as much love as you want or need .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #31:1>
I do find sometimes if I 'm depressed I edit the kind of things I 'd say to you because I think . &ldquo; No , he doesn't want to hear this . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #32:1>
But I wouldn't want you to think that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #33:1>
I hope you know that I don't mind what you feel or say .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #34:1>
x I .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #35:1>
P. S .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #36:1>
Since I wrote this we 've talked for 1 hour and 15 mins !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #37:2>
( A neither-One-thing-nor-the-other letter . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #38:2>
Dear F. F.
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #39:2>
Well 9.50 and here we are on the tube again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #40:2>
What an extraordinarily monosylabbic monosyllabic NO phone conversation we had yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #41:2>
I think the problem was that it took place 2 days after I 'd phoned you and by the time you and I had actually got to be compus compos mentis at the same time I 'd forgotten what I wanted to say .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #42:2>
Anyway , on the way to N 's class at the A. C. again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #43:2>
Am I scared ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #44:2>
Well , less than last week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #45:2>
I 'm going to take what I 'd like to call my courage in hand and ask for something demanding and difficult .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #46:2>
I feel kind of sad this morning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #47:2>
Sad for E. and the life at home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #48:2>
I think God knew what he was talking about when he decided that a child should have 2 parents one of each sex who care about it and about each other .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #49:2>
What E has at home at the moment is 3 women who make a fuss of her in all the wrong ways but who really are totally uninterested in her and do nothing at all for her . at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #50:2>
Nadia doesn't let E in the room when she 's playing the piano so that Idea hasn't worked out at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #51:2>
The Idea was that this was someone who loved the piano and who , as she was a communicative person would be able to communicate her love of the instrument and have joy at playing it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #52:2>
But alas this is not to be .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #53:2>
Also they all three think there is something wrong with me because I don't sleep with any of my male friends - Not even Colin who leaves messages on my fridge like &ldquo; Why do I still love you ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #54:2>
Here 's a little ditty Pascale was singing rather loud the other day ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #X55:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #56:2>
I felt like shouting out &ldquo; Fuck off &rdquo; as I know to who it was directed but decided it would be more prudent to keep quiet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #57:2>
After class - Journey home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #58:2>
Well I did it -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #59:2>
I asked for a hard piece and she said &ldquo; A really hard one ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #60:2>
So I said &ldquo; Well , why Not ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #61:2>
So I 'm given Harriet Shelley 's Mad , Suicide speech when she 's in Hyde Park at midnight , picking up men and reciting poetry with hummed screams , digressions to infancy , hatred and the like !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #62:2>
It makes you feel good when you pull off work like that and I noticed that I had 100% of their attention .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #63:2>
So if I really have guts I 'll get hold of it and use it for an audition piece .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #64:2>
I 've been asked out by this actor/journalist tonight that I went to see last week and I 'm really not interested .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #65:2>
He tries so hard .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #66:2>
I shall have to tell him not to try so much .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #67:2>
So why am I going ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #68:2>
Because I want to see the show and I don't want to go with my girlfriends .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #69:2>
They don't wash up at home and I have to nag or clean up after them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #70:2>
Why is it that if you try to be supportive of people you so often get taken advantage of ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #71:2>
As you can see I 'm reaching the stage where I 've had enough of having my house full of strangers with even more problems than I have .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #72:2>
Maybe next year I 'll sell up and buy a flat for Emily and myself .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #73:2>
Still , one thing at a time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #74:2>
I 'm going to go to Christian Fellowship meeting at my new church tommorow tomorrow night !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #75:2>
Whatever next ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #76:2>
I 'm so hungry ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #77:2>
Better leave the rest of this letter till tonight .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #78:2>
Just offered the girl next to me 10p for one Rolo ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #79:2>
she gave it to me , obviously not a businesswoman .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #80:2>
On the train again , shame I can't read really and then I wouldn't have to spend train journey's journeys writing to you when I 've got absolutely nothing to say .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #81:2>
There are groups of students on the train tonight all competing on a treasure hunt .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #82:2>
Suddenly I feel so old .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #83:2>
So , what am I going to tonight ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #84:2>
My diary informs me the show is called &lsquo; House of Blue Leaves &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #85:2>
But what to say to Andrew after the show ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #86:2>
There lies the problem .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #87:2>
Not much to entertain you with on the Nrth lyne Line tonight , lets
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #88:2>
let 's play a game .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #89:2>
If you could choose any 2 people alive or dead to spend an evening with , excluding Him , who would you choose , and why .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #90:2>
Answers on a postcard please .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #91:2>
Oops now I have to think don't I ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #92:2>
I 'd have to exclude all the theological people because if I wasn't allowed Christ I 'd certainly have a few questions for St. Peter and the Virgin Mary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #93:2>
Gandhi ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #94:2>
James Dean ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #95:2>
Munro ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #96:2>
Tolstoy ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #97:2>
Some georgous gorgeous men in the show tonight .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #98:2>
American .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #99:2>
Had the what-can-you-do - ? Carry-a-card - ? problem again !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #100:2>
This actor Andrew hangs around in bars afterwards and meets the directors , but he looks awful , really awful ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #101:2>
tonight he was actually ill and should have been in bed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #102:2>
The play ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #103:2>
A tragi-comedy-farce
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #104:2>
well yes it was interesting ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #105:2>
I 'm afraid 6.50 is a bit much for me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #106:2>
You can see a good fringe show for less than that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #107:2>
Is that all I 've got to say about it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #108:2>
Yes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #109:2>
Tommorow Tomorrow phoning , writing letters for jobs e.t.c. all day then a church meeting in the evening .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #110:2>
I 'm sure that lot will inspire me when the alarm goes off !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #111:2>
Still havn't haven't eaten anything .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #112:2>
11.30 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #113:2>
Oh well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #114:2>
Have to close my eyes for a stop ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #115:2>
What a ridiculous letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #116:2>
Still might as well send it anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #117:2>
I 'll write another inspired one next week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #118:2>
F and I have had a good morning chasing up work and making phone calls .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #119:2>
Must go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #120:2>
Wish you were coming to this party on Sunday .

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #125:3>
Oh dear , I 'm rather late but Happy Birthday , anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #126:3>
Did you have a fun time ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #127:3>
So where will you be going , then ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #128:3>
I hope you did well in your exams .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #129:3>
I was sorry to hear about the hamsters but glad that Fleur is obviously still biting fit ? !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #130:3>
Did you know that I have 2 puddy tats now !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #131:3>
Molly &ampersand; Lucy - 2 little sisters about 13 mths old , now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #132:3>
They 're adorable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #133:3>
Oh Laura , Sue told me about your doggy -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #134:3>
I 'm so sorry .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #135:3>
You must miss him heaps !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #136:3>
Well , things are pretty hunky dory here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #137:3>
I 've been out and about a lot , sp spending loads of money which I haven't got in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #138:3>
There 's a new man on the scene as well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #139:3>
I 'm treading very carefully tho -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #140:3>
I 'd rather be free &ampersand; single than tied down to someone unless it 's THE one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #141:3>
Work 's also fine altho morale is pretty low at the mo due to mingy pay rises .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #142:3>
Still , that can't be helped -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #143:3>
it 's the general state of the motor industry .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #144:3>
The house has now been sold so I 'll be hoping to exchange contracts &ampersand; move soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #145:3>
I 'll keep you posted .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #146:3>

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #150:4>
Congratulations on getting a first class honours degree .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #151:4>
I received your letter yesterday ( the 4th Aug ) and was delighted to hear your good news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #152:4>
I hope everything will now fall in to into place for your Ph.D .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #153:4>
It 's also good to hear about Karen &ampersand; Andr&eacute; -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #154:4>
if you talk to her soon , please send her my congratulations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #155:4>
Life out here is pretty good .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #156:4>
I 've just finished my diving project which was excellent .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #157:4>
I was living on an island which was basically a jungle in the middle of the sea .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #158:4>
We cleared part of the jungle to make our camp which consisted of sleeping quarters , kitchen , Bar/BBQ ( very important ! ) , dive store area , communal area &ampersand; loo .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #159:4>
It really felt like home &ampersand; I was sad to leave .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #160:4>
The only good thing about leaving was that I have now had my first fresh water wash for 3 1/2 weeks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #161:4>
It was strange sitting in the sea with my Wash'n'go shampoo &ampersand; a razor !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #162:4>
The diving was excellent -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #163:4>
beautiful coral &ampersand; amazing coloured fish - also turtles .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #164:4>
The people here are great .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #165:4>
It 's amazing the depth of friendship you can achieve when you 're living on an island , miles from home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #166:4>
I think people need to confide in others because they miss the companionship of friends at home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #167:4>
I 've had 7 letters from Bob and have been able to phone him 3 times .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #168:4>
I think he 's feeling the time going more slowly than I am since he 's the one left behind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #169:4>
However , he 's off to California on 10th August for 2 weeks which should help .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #170:4>
I 'm dying to see him again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #171:4>
I really miss him not being around because I 'm so used to seeing him every day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #172:4>
I 'm now about to start the second project .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #173:4>
I 'll be based in Similajan National Park in Sarawak where the main aim is to survey the park with a view to recommending possible tourist areas/conservation areas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #174:4>
Luckily the park is bordered on one side by the sea , so hopefully I 'll be able to top up the tan !
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #175:4>
The food has been interesting so far .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #176:4>
A mixture of fresh , Malaysian Army Rations ( basically curry ) and Raven Rations ( UK rations used in the Antartic/Artic Antarctic/Arctic ? ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #177:4>
The staff on this project seem great .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #178:4>
We 're really lucky to have a Ghurka Gurkha from the British Army with us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #179:4>
They 're amazing people -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #180:4>
they 've got inbuilt instinct into coping with life in the jungle .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #181:4>
Anyway , Laura , thanks ever so much for your letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #182:4>
It was great to hear from you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #183:4>
Please give my love to Simon -
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #184:4>
I hope his exams were OK .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #185:4>
See you in September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-010 #186:4>

Dear Forename1 and Forename2 ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #3:1>
I thought it was about time I wrote to you again to say hello and tell you what I 've been doing !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #4:1>
First of all , I hope that the surgery on your nose was 100% successful , Forename1 and that you have no worries on that score now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #5:1>
I was sorry to hear about your traumatic experience &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #6:1>
it must have been very harrowing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #7:1>
Were you given the option about what shape your nose ended up after the plastic surgery ? ! !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #8:1>
My latest news is that I have moved into a flat which I have bought all by myself !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #9:1>
I was living with Forename3 at the time you came to London but we split up at the beginning of December and I have picked up again the relationship I was having with someone before I met Forename3 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #10:1>
His name is Forename4 and until last year we had been seeing each other for 5 years , although we had been studying at different universities , he at Manchester and me in Oxford , for most of that time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #11:1>
I am now very happy with him again and feel that he is right for me , although Forename3 is a lovely person .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #12:1>
I still see Forename3 as a friend , and he has just presented me with a copy of his book which has just been published &ldquo; The Green Economy &rdquo; :
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #13:1>
I can't remember whether he mentioned to you that he was writing it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #14:1>
It 's full of good arguments for and sound ideas for an environmentally-friendlier economy based on sustainable development and more equitable distribution of resources and benefits .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #15:1>
My flat is in one of the cheaper parts of London as you can see from the address but it 's in a quiet tree-lined street filled with pretty houses , mostly built in the late 19th century , like this one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #16:1>
( Forename2 , you 'll have to come &ampersand; visit the area to hear some authentic cockney accents ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #17:1>
There 's a brilliant fruit and veg and everything-else market aro just down the road , where West Indian and African women drive some hard bargains with stallholders .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #18:1>
Hackney has become fashionable among artists , actors and writers who want to live some way into London but who don't have much money .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #19:1>
For the same reason , it is quite popular with young profs ( like myself ! ) and the shops are showing some signs of this -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #20:1>
our &ldquo; corner shop &rdquo; is almost a health food shop !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #21:1>
As far as work goes , I am on 4 months ' secondment to the BBC Copyright Department where I follow up cases of infringement of BBC copyright eg pirate postcards of John Cleese in Fawlty Towers , people selling tapes of BBC broadcasts etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #22:1>
It 's an interesting area of the law and involves doing a lot of work on my own without having to constantly refer to the head of department .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #23:1>
However , I 'm not sure I agree with the extent of copyright law -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #24:1>
sometimes the assertion of rights over words , characters , designs &ampersand; so on can seem very petty and I hate the thought that all these elements must belong to someone who can demand payment for their use .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #25:1>
It is The BBC 's copyright dept is in the heart of the West End , just off Portland Place , which is wonderful -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #26:1>
I love wandering around the area , going up to Regent 's Park or braving the Oxford Street shops .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #27:1>
I 'll be there until the first week in September so I 'm lucky to have had the summer there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #28:1>
Quite a change from Allison &ampersand; Humphreys offices in on the edge of Spitalfields !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #29:1>
I 've been getting some joyful letters from Forename5 who barely mentions her back problem now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #30:1>
It seems she 's had a happy and successful year , after all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #31:1>
I 'm so glad -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #32:1>
she was more despondent and depressed than I 've ever seen her when I left her to come home last September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #33:1>
I 'll finish now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #34:1>
Are you coming to London in September ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #35:1>
Forename5 comes back mid-September so perhaps we could get together .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #36:1>
Lots of love Forename6
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #37:2>
Sat. 24th August
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #38:2>
Dear Forename1 ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #39:2>
My head has been filled with thoughts of you since we spoke yesterday ( was it only yesterday ? )
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #40:2>
Mainly just missing you &ampersand; wanting to be home with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #41:2>
Sitting ( Forename2 lying ) in a quiet corner of the quiet campus at Berkeley , away from the Saturday crowds along Telegraph Avenue .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #42:2>
It 's hard to imagine the student body of this university as leaders of anti-Vietnam war , anti-establishment protests , this campus the scene of pitched battles with petrol bombs on one side &ampersand; tear gas on the other .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #43:2>
The students we saw seemed young &ampersand; frivolous .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #44:2>
Maybe some of the sellers of jewellry jewellery and tie-dye T shirts along the street with their pony tails &ampersand; beards are survivors of that student generation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #45:2>
I don't think I 've seen a tie-dye T-shirt since <unclear-word> around 1974 but they are here in abundance &ampersand; in the most garish colours imaginable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #46:2>
There are the most wonderful bookstores in Berkeley - the one we went into this afternoon made all the more wonderful by virtue of having a caf&eacute; attached to it where people just sit for hours reading &ampersand; watching the weird collection of people who pass by .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #47:2>
The train to Berkeley is a treat too :
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #48:2>
streamlined &ampersand; silver coloured , it looks rather futuristic ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #49:2>
wide seats ( for wide American bottoms ) and lots of room in aisles make it really comfortable -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #50:2>
commuting on one of these would be a joy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #51:2>
The city of S. F seems to have so many things sorted out - transport ( electric buses &ampersand; a subway ) , clean air , comprehensive recycling programme , well designed &ampersand; maintained parks etc but the one real problem is the number of homeless people begging on the streets .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #52:2>
Some of them are quite aggressive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #53:2>
I was surprised to see more of them here than in NY , maybe as many as in London but the only place where settlements have been made is outside City Hall where the Mayor has given permission for them to sleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #54:2>
Getting out of the subway at Civic Center &ampersand; going towards the municipal buildings is pretty unnerving .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #55:2>
The electronic <unclear-word> indicators on the subway platforms double as advertising space .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #56:2>
One of the ads is placed by the S. F. Zoo
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #57:2>
&ldquo; Do something exotic , wet and wild !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #58:2>
Adopt an acre of rainforest -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #59:2>
save jaguars , butterflies , orchids and monkeys !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #60:2>
Telephone the S. F. Zoo on <unclear-word> &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #61:2>
We went to a concert by a Chilean guitarist Rafael Manriquez last night held at the unlikely venue of the 1st Old Presbyterian Church .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #62:2>
It felt strange to sit in pews looking around at the austere Protestant architecture &ampersand; listening to songs of poverty , love &ampersand; revolution .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #63:2>
Before each song he explained what it was about in that lilting Spanish accent &ampersand; with that gentle sincerity I associated with Hugo .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #64:2>
It was seemed ironic that to hear the singer speak of the injustice of dictatorship and the corruption bred by power &ampersand; greed with the US flag standing behind him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #65:2>
A rather different evening on Wednesday -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #66:2>
dinner champagne ( a good imitation of it , anyway ! ) and excellent jazz at Kimball 's .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #67:2>
The band was the Cecil Payne/Junior Cooke Boptet , the 2 named saxophonists being of the Dizzy Gillespie &ampersand; Art Blakey generation &ampersand; having played with both .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #68:2>
Our waitress for the evening was so exuberant and enthusiastic that I couldn't help laughing -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #69:2>
I wondered whether she started off like that &ampersand; wound down by the time the club closed at 2 a.m .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #70:2>
The differences between U. S. and British attitudes to work , to other people , to everything never cease to surprise me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #71:2>
With waitering it has much to do with the system of tipping that rewards cheerfulness with cash &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #72:2>
generally though - the Americans are more honest about their deep desire to be liked & approved of f -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #73:2>
look at all the posters with photos of &ldquo; employees of the month &rdquo; on the MUNI buses ( smiling bus drivers &ampersand; engineers ) -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #74:2>
there 's a tear off pad for passengers to write their nominations on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #75:2>
Forename2 says the high turnover of staff at the Treasury is mainly due to people that feeling unappreciated &ampersand; insufficiently rewarded -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #76:2>
no-one bothers to tell them they 're good until they 've just handed in their notice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #77:2>
Perhaps we Brits should admit we all just wanna want to be loved .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #78:2>
Monday 27th Aug
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #79:2>
A really lovely day yesterday , spent at the Marin Headlands , a rocky , sandy area just over the Golden Gate Bridge and part of the Golden Gate Recreation Area .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #80:2>
Brilliant views of the bridge &ampersand; bay .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #81:2>
Forename2 couldn't face the roundabout route we 'd have to take by bus so we got a taxi , <unclear-word> which turned out to be a great idea -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #82:2>
the taxi driver chatted all the way there about the trails we could take , gave us his personal weather forecast &ampersand; even took us to the best bagel shop in S. F. to get food for the day ( still not as good as Clapton bagels ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #83:2>
The Marin Headlands are home to pelicans , herons , gulls &ampersand; lots of other seabirds I don't know the names of .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #84:2>
It was great watching them flying , swooping &ampersand; splashing around in the water .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #85:2>
It felt like we were really in the wilds as we walked along the beach &ampersand; up the hills among the scrubby plants &ampersand; bushes that grow there -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #86:2>
a taste of the hiking we 'd planned to do for a whole week , but also a lot of lying down in the sun !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #87:2>
Initial.of.Forename2 brings her inflatable mat everywhere so she can rest her back while we 're out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #88:2>
well , maybe not to the shops
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #89:2>
We were planning to take a car up to the Russian River Valley today but initial.of.Forename.2 strained her back climbing these hills yesterday &ampersand; is in bed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #90:2>
I 've come up to Haight Street ( home of the hippies I told you about ) to get a haircut .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #91:2>
I 'm waiting for the time of my appointment in a shop almost as weird as Baldies in London -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #92:2>
the person who booked me in had his eyebrows shaved &ampersand; replaced by straight black painted lines and he had earrings , not only in his ears but through his nose and lip !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #93:2>
The place was recommended by Forename3 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #94:2>
Forename4 was no authority on hairdressers since he can't remember the last time he had a haircut &ampersand; wears his in a long ponytail .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #95:2>
I left them this morning eating chicken soup for breakfast -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #96:2>
nothing is unorthodox here !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #97:2>
We saw some photographs at the Ansel Adams Center .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #98:2>
I 'd never seen any of his work in quantity before or prints of such a size - really the only way to appreciate it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #99:2>
Impressive views of Yosemite with its massive rocks and beautiful forests made me wish we 'd made it there this holiday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #100:2>
Views which you wouldn't imagine it was possible to capture with a camera .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #101:2>
Also Lee Friedlander 's work of urban U.S. the best being of office workers in front of VDUs looking bored out of their skulls .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #102:2>
And most memorable , Lou Demattais Demattai 's photojournalistic pictures of Nicaragua - a baseball game in a wrecked cathedral , a father 's anguished face as he stands over his little daughter killed in a Contra ambush , &ampersand; the famous photo of Eugene Hasenfus the US mercenary being led away from his crashed plane by Sandinista soldiers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #103:2>
You should just about get this letter by the time I get home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #104:2>
Really looking forward to seeing you my dear .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #105:2>
Love you lots .

hi Hi you old Brits !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #109:3>
Thought Laura 'd like this card as it 's a rather Italian scene - in fact , part of Byz. Monastery buildings , which otherwise were all pink-roofed and full of mosaics and frescoes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #110:3>
Everything 's congenial here in Mavrommati - thanks for your letter by the way - and we 've just had lunch and the siesta 's beginning .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #111:3>
The students here all seem to be fun and easy going except another girl from King 's , who only came cos her boyfriend did , and is a catty bit of work .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #112:3>
The Prof is <unclear-word> complete amiableness and his kid , altho' rather obnoxious , is good fun to play with -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #113:3>
he seems to have adopted me &ampersand; Liz .
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #114:3>
Yest. ate in a proper local place , but had to stare at carcases while we did so , and a delicacy - a skull , being chopped in half !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #115:3>
Hope the summer 's good -
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #116:3>
well done to Giles !
<ICE-GB:W1B-011 #117:3>
Lots of love ,

18th August 1990
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #2:1>
Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #3:1>
It was good to hear you on the phone today but not good to hear you so sad + lonely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #4:1>
I keep thinking how it would be to go to all these places + experience all these things with you -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #5:1>
how does the Joan Armatrading song go ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #X6:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #7:1>
We 're staying in the house of Anne 's sister-in-law 's cousin however Tom
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #8:1>
but he isn't here ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #9:1>
just his <unclear-word> house mate Peter , who is so laid back he wasn't here when we arrived , just left the key under the mat -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #10:1>
this is NOT New York !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #11:1>
We took a shuttle bus from the airport ( door-to-door service ) driven by a rather creepy guy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #12:1>
We both thought he was like a character from a horror film -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #13:1>
the same nervous mannerisms and super-chattiness as Anthony Perkins in &ldquo; Psycho &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #14:1>
He took it upon himself to tell us about the highlights of SF , pointing out : &ldquo; Golden Gate Bridge to your left , Bay Bridge to your right ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #15:1>
you can take a boat trip to Alcatraz &rdquo; etc etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #16:1>
We just wanted to go to sleep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #17:1>
When we arrived we didn't immediately see the key
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #18:1>
and Anne went off to try to phone Peter or Tom to find out where it was , leaving me on the doorstep .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #19:1>
I took another look under the mat + found the key so went running after her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #20:1>
Traced her steps from the grocery store to the gay church
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #21:1>
( lilac-painted window frames ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #22:1>
I <unclear-word> guessed there was some kind of function going on because a line of slim-hipped men in evening wear filed past into the hall to a round of applause .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #23:1>
What an appropriate introduction to San Francisco !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #24:1>
Peter and his partner , Mary are friendly + helpful without making us feel they 're putting themselves out for us which is a great relief -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #25:1>
they 're both graduate students
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #26:1>
so <unclear-characters> the atmosphere is that of a student house , with friends calling in and the teapot always full .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #27:1>
Anne 's back has been quite bad again after the flight so we aren't going off hiking as originally planned but we 'll probably get out of town + drive along the coast to some of the smaller towns :
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #28:1>
there 's a coast road which is said to be quite beautiful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #29:1>
I gave A. a massage earlier which was quite successful -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #30:1>
I told her I 'd only done this sort of thing in a sexual context before + didn't know what I was doing !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #31:1>
We went to the area known as Mission this afternoon to mingle with the Saturday afternoon shoppers in the Latin American neighbourhood -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #32:1>
most shop signs and adverts on billboards are in Spanish .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #33:1>
Getting onto a packed bus with crowds of Latin Am. women in their 50s + 60s , none of whom o were taller than 5' , chattering in Spanish to each other , it seemed that there was were a <unclear-characters> number of continuing conversations : A
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #34:1>
a woman would be talking to another until the other got off + she then appeared to continue the same stream of words , now directed at the next person to move up next to her !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #35:1>
It felt as if we were in Mexico .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #36:1>
The area where we 're staying is called Castro , which approximates to paradise on earth for gay men + lesbians .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #37:1>
All the stores appear to be run by them + for them : bookshops , menswear shops , fitness + tanning centres , lots of florists , french French pastry shops , a caf&eacute; on every corner selling several varieties of cappucino + expresso and the largest , richest chocolates you 've ever seen !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #38:1>
Best cup of coffee I 've had since my arrival in the U.S .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #39:1>
( American coffee is disgusting )
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #40:1>
The architecture here is dramatically different from that in Manhattan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #41:1>
You can see the sky !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #42:1>
2 storey houses painted in pastel pinks , blues + greens , some with wooden facing , line streets which dip down and rise again to a hill .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #43:1>
The downtown area with its skyscrapers and the Golden Gate Bay Bridge is visible through a gap .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #44:1>
Small hills with trees peep over the roofs in places .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #45:1>
It feels like a seaside town .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #46:1>
The house we 're in was built in 1901 and has a large crack above the stairs from the earthquake in 1906 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #47:1>
However , no other lasting damage has been done by the 2 subsequent earthquakes ( one last year ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #48:1>
I bet everyone has &ldquo; earthquake stories &rdquo; to tell .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #49:1>
Skipping back to our last but one night in New York , we went to see another play by August Wilson - &ldquo; The Piano Lesson &rdquo; - which is playing on Broadway (
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #50:1>
the closest I got to Broadway last time was off off Broadway ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #51:1>
The play is set in Pittsburgh in 1936 + has the same themes as Ma Rainey + Joe Turner : the legacy of slavery , black aspirations in the context of white oppression and a spiritual element .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #52:1>
The star of the show was Boy Willie ( both in the sense that his character was the catalyst for the action and that he acted brilliantly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #53:1>
A man desperate to make something of his life after years of servitude he wants to buy some land .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #54:1>
The means he sees to finance it is the piano his father and mother left to him and his sister <unclear-word> Berniece Berenice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #55:1>
To him , it 's just a valuable piece of furniture that no one ever uses , <unclear-character> the sale of which would give him the cash he needs .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #56:1>
To Berenice , however , it records the suffering of the family through the generations , from her great-grandmother and her grandfather who were sold in exchange for the piano , to her father who was shot + killed taking it back from the white family who had bought it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #57:1>
Despite its tragic theme , it is an extremely funny play , particularly in the scenes where Boy Willie 's friend and accomplice , Lyman appears -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #58:1>
his ambition is not to make money but to play the Casanova but hasn't the confidence to hit it off with the streetwise town women .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #59:1>
Sunday
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #60:1>
I went to Golden Gate Park today , leaving Anne in bed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #61:1>
It 's a beautiful park , especially the parts with trees and water which make you feel you 're not in a city at all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #62:1>
There are people of all sizes , ages + colours , in family groups , couples or on their own walking roller skating or cycling .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #63:1>
The roller skates which are for hire at the entrance are the type with a single line of wheels
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #64:1>
so they behave more like ice skates
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #65:1>
and a few people who were really proficient were dancing as if on ice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #66:1>
There 's a conservatory modelled on Kew Gardens but it 's rather disappointing :
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #67:1>
it is full of plants from the jungles + forests of the world but many are the same varieties as are sold as house plants but MUCH BIGGER !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #68:1>
To get to the park you go through a district called Haight Ashbury where the rump of the hippie community lives and hangs out -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #69:1>
people in tie dye + headbands , shops selling leather clothing and Indian rugs - all very uninteresting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #70:1>
It is quite fascinating that there are all these different districts in San Francisco though .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #71:1>
I 'm glad we 're in Castro .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #72:1>
I 'll finish this now + put it in the post tomorrow -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #73:1>
do write .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #74:1>
Tell me about your problems with the book if you like -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #75:1>
it might help to write them down .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #76:1>
Keep watering the plants !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #77:1>
Love Jill

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #80:2>
I 'm sitting in the <unclear-character> room Anne + I are occupying in Tom + Peter 's house - a house defying all one 's <unclear-characters> preconceptions of living space in New York .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #81:2>
A tall townhouse dating from the mid C19th with a tree filled back garden , standing in a street of similar houses but only a block away from the heart of Chelsea with its down at the heel shops and welfare hotels .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #82:2>
This house is gloriously old and tatty :
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #83:2>
plaster flakes off the walls ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #84:2>
dirt accumulates on windowsills ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #85:2>
the air conditioning system is vintage 1950s as is the fridge + other kitchen furniture .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #86:2>
Much of the other furniture is serviceable 1960s style , while the nick nacks vary from pretty antique to pure <unclear-word> kitsch .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #87:2>
Framed sepia family photographs sit next to books on feminism and social issues .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #88:2>
Tom used to be a social worker and is college lecturer + still goes to &ldquo; school &rdquo; but I 'm not sure in what capacity , and is an editor of a journal of &female; + social work .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #89:2>
Peter used to work full time for Forbes magazine + still writes a column .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #90:2>
They 're both in their mid to late 70s but are permanently busy with either professional or social obligations , relishing their role as NY hosts to all the relatives and friends who take advantage of their central Manhattan address .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #91:2>
They gave us the most explicit instructions as to how things should be done , from the locking and unlocking of the 2 heavy double doors to the street , down to how to open the umbrella we borrowed yesterday !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #92:2>
We only have to mention the our planned destination for the morning and they will tell us which bus to take , where to change and will even draw a map .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #93:2>
The explanations are appear to be primarily Peter 's responsibility , along with making the coffee and stacking the dishwasher ( &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #94:2>
It 's in his job description ' says Tom ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #95:2>
Tom is a feminist , remarkable for someone of her generation and has laid the ground rules for domestic duties .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #96:2>
One of her favourite sayings is &ldquo; boys + girls are different &rdquo; to <unclear-characters> explain for example June 's + her different attitudes to the dishwasher
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #97:2>
&ldquo; I use a machine so that I can turn it on + walk away from it &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #98:2>
Boys like to play with machines .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #99:2>
Peter pretends not to hear but retaliates when she receives notice that her name is going into Who 's Who
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #100:2>
&ldquo; But that 's only the women 's Who 's Who -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #101:2>
they don't put the women in the real one &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #102:2>
It 's all very lighthearted -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #103:2>
they continually contradict each other + fill in details for each other , almost as if one will forget or misremember something on purpose just so the other has a chance to chime in and complete the picture for us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #104:2>
Anne + I managed to meet Mary this morning for a couple of hours before she had to go back to Washington where she 's working for the World Bank as a summer job .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #105:2>
She is fortunate in that her work is on the resettlement of people displaced by WB-sponsored dam projects in India , which is highly relevant to her course and probably to her thesis which she 'll begin next year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #106:2>
She seems to love the studying and living in NY and now has an Indian political activist for a boyfriend -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #107:2>
one of the reasons she makes the trip back to NY every weekend !
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #108:2>
We went to a jazz club for Sunday brunch today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #109:2>
Black female blues singer - with pianist , double bassist and drummer played on as the tables emptied after the customers had finished eating .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #110:2>
We 'd arrived late + stayed until that point in the session where the band ask for requests , the audience looks blank and uninspired , and the piano player looks at the vocalist as if to say &ldquo; let 's finish + go + eat &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #111:2>
All this reminds me of &ldquo; The Fabulous Baker Boys &rdquo; -
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #112:2>
perhaps the right thing to say would be that it is testament to how well the film recreated the small club atmosphere rather than vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #113:2>
The city does not feel hostile in the way it did when I was last here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #114:2>
This mainly stems from having the security of somewhere to stay that is a home + not a hotel + arriving with ease + without anxiety : transported by taxi to the front door of this house + greeted by friendly faces .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #115:2>
I even feel OK on the subway :
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #116:2>
the trains are now air conditioned + free of the graffiti which used to make me feel the sprayers had marked out this territory as their own .
<ICE-GB:W1B-012 #117:2>
The platforms are oppressively hot - less air circulates than on the London underground platforms even though we are not so far underground here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #1:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #2:1>
Dear J
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #3:1>
I 'm sitting in the garden of Bob &ampersand; Tom 's house surrounded by roses , bluebells , clematis , parsley &ampersand; chives .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #4:1>
This really is a beautiful house &ampersand; garden .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #5:1>
The rooms are large &ampersand; look larger &because-symbol; there is little furniture .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #6:1>
The kitchen is where all social activity takes place : an aga Aga stove dominating the space .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #7:1>
Nothing is put away &ampersand; nothing really has a fixed place where it is kept -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #8:1>
an environment less like Bob &ampersand; Tom 's home it is hard to imagine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #9:1>
H &ampersand; I have rooms &ampersand; beds to ourselves until Bob gets back .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #10:1>
I 'm in his room which reflects his artistic nature -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #11:1>
the floor is painted yellow - covered with stencilled black lizards .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #12:1>
One wall is vertical wooden planks painted yellow green , black &ampersand; red .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #13:1>
There is another reptile ( or maybe an armadillo are they reptiles ? ) made of tin on the wall .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #14:1>
H was able to get up for the first time in 3 days yesterday evening &ampersand; we went to see a play : &lsquo; Stand Up Tragedy &rsquo; , about a white , liberal , middle-class teacher full of idealism , going to teach in a Catholic school in a no-hope area of NY .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #15:1>
Thankfully , there was no trite message being thrust upon us &ampersand; there was no happy ending .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #16:1>
The dilemma tackled by the piece was whether the teachers should do no more than teach &ampersand; drill the boys <unclear-words> ( for they were all boys - no &female; in the cast at all ) and if they did some act justifying expulsion - dump them without trying to find out why OR whether the teachers should try to understand the kids ' problems to solve them
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #17:1>
The head of the school Father Larkin tells the new teacher , Tom , that they must not disturb the &lsquo; ecology &rsquo; of the society on whose borders they are , where inter-relationships are finely balanced , particularly within families where violence &ampersand; a suffocating closeness appear to make life intolerable but which at least give its members somewhere to belong .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #18:1>
This is expressed most effectively by the main character among the boys , Lee , a Hispanic who escapes into the fantasyland of comic books &ampersand; creates his own characters which are re his representations of his family .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #19:1>
Scenes between himself , his psychopathic elder brother &ampersand; his mother are conjured up by this one actor , switching from one character to the other with a skill that is utterly convincing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #20:1>
The only bad thing about the play was the rather embarrasing embarrassing song &ampersand; dance routines &agrave; la West Side Story done in rap - you know the kind of thing - actors pretending to be tough guys but singing !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #21:1>
I went to the surprisingly good SF Museum of MA yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #22:1>
I wasn't expecting to see anything particularly interesting -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #23:1>
it would all be so disappointing after NY .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #24:1>
But there were some good German expressionist pix - Beckman , Kirchner &ampersand; Jawlensky , some surrealists , some of Matisse 's , a Picasso plus photos by a Czech &ampersand; a Lithuanian taken of their respective countries during the war .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #25:1>
I reveal my materialist nature , however , when I say the part I found most enjoyab impressive was the shop !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #26:1>
Coloured mobiles , T-shirts with arty designs or slogans , imaginative kids ' toys &ampersand; other delightful objects , like designer napkin rings for $45 a set !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #27:1>
I also went to the Jewish Museum which turned out to be more an art gallery - colourful paintings &ampersand; drawings by someone called Antony Dubowsky .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #28:1>
He tells the story of his grandparents coming over from Russia to San Diego at the time of the Revolution , in pictures as if they were snapshots - &ldquo; grandad getting off the boat &rdquo; etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #29:1>
There 's a kids ' corner with crayons &ampersand; squares drawn on paper headed &ldquo; how did your family come to the United States ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #X30:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #31:1>
We passed through the Italian District , North Beach , today with its numerous caf&eacute;s &ampersand; restaurants , Italian hairdressers &ampersand; delicatessens - many of the shops established when the 1st Italians to arrive in SF settled here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #32:1>
We bought Italian cheeses , fresh pasta &ampersand; olives -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #33:1>
American food may not be up to much
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #34:1>
but at least you can get Italian , Chinese , Thai , French , Jewish , Mexican ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #35:1>
Next to North Beach is Chinatown -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #36:1>
not one other person on the street was caucasian
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #37:1>
, just crowds &ampersand; crowds of Chinese , pushing past us , sorting through the amazingly varied selection of fruit &ampersand; veg outside the stores &ampersand; the fresh fish &ampersand; meat .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #38:1>
This was serious shopping .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #39:1>
I 'm thinking a lot about you these days , missing you , wanting you lying here beside me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #40:1>
I 'm not attempting to foresee what my emotions will be telling me when I get back home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #41:1>
I haven't heard anything from F , athough although he wanted my address so he could write &ampersand; I imagined he might be wanting to say IMPORTANT things -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #42:1>
maybe he 's decided a heavy dialogue by letter at a distance of 6000 miles is worse than one by phone over 200 miles .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #43:1>
I feel kind of out of touch with my feelings here
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #44:1>
( yes I know that 's a contradiction ! ) that is , I feel as if I have suspended real life for 3 wks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #45:1>
I thought the time away might help me to think about the situation more clearly but it has just relieved the pressure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #46:1>
I hope you 're feeling less lonely &ampersand; more positive about the book .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #47:1>
I keep wanting to ring you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #48:1>
I 'll finish now &ampersand; send this tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #49:1>
I love you ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #50:1>

19th June 1991
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #52:2>
Dear Helen ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #53:2>
I 'm here at last !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #54:2>
It 's great to have my own bolt-hole where I can do as I like without having to fit around anyone else and with all my assorted junk around me , accumulated through the years ( although some of it I am anxious to get rid of , my taste having changed somewhat over that years time ! ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #55:2>
The only thing I am lacking is a wardrobe .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #56:2>
I bought one from a secondhand shop in New X at Easter &ampersand; paid for it &ampersand; they said they 'd deliver it when I wanted it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #57:2>
After letting me down twice on the delivery dates , they finally confessed that they 'd sold it to someone else !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #58:2>
So all my clothes are festooned around the flat for the moment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #59:2>
Things are looking rosier and rosier for the labour party Labour Party .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #60:2>
I expect you heard reports of Maggie 's speeches in Chicago &ampersand; New York -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #61:2>
did you hear Ted Heath 's explosive reaction ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #62:2>
It was quite startling to hear him saying that it was she and not pro Europeans who had a small mind :
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #63:2>
&ldquo; It 's minute ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #64:2>
that 's what it is ! &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #65:2>
Unfortunately , his emotion appeared to get in the way of his reasoning
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #66:2>
and I didn't think he effectively showed up her arguments as bad ones , and he ended up looking like the irrational one .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #67:2>
That was my impression anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #68:2>
There was a much better riposte to her fears of the &ldquo; European superstate &rdquo; in The Guardian today pointing out that a &ldquo; federal &rdquo; Europe would mean decentralisation to the regions rather than the expansion of bureaucracy at supra national level and there would be less power , not more for the national leaders to hammer out deals between themselves without consultation with their electorates .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #69:2>
Anyway , the mud-slinging in the Tory party over this and the failure of John Major to come out with a strong statement of his own is all good news .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #70:2>
It looks like the general election will have to be postponed until the last moment , and even then the Tories may not be able to smooth over internal rifts , sort out a policy on Europe and most importantly make the economy look a bit better .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #71:2>
John Smith and Tony Blair are lunching with merchant bankers and looking terribly reasonable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #72:2>
The Tories have been trying to capitalise on the council service strike in Liverpool
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #73:2>
( response to council 's proposed redundancies ) -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #74:2>
the refuse collectors have been on strike for weeks and there 's a threat to call out gravediggers and crematorium workers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #75:2>
Eric Heffer died a week or so ago &ampersand; his Liverpool seat is being fought over by a hard leftie Lesley Mahmoud who wants to nationalise the top 200 companies and a Kinnockite , Peter Kilfoyle .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #76:2>
Coincidentally , there 's a TV series just started called &ldquo; GBH &rdquo; by Alan Bleasdale which is about a Derek Hatton type council leader more concerned with personal power th and heroic posturing than the people whose lives his policies affect , decreeing a strike throughout the city ( unnamed North West city ) and ensuring no-one crosses picket lines by sending vanloads of leather jacketed tough guys to supervise them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #77:2>
I 'm so glad to hear your spirits have revived and are now soaring .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #78:2>
I hope that 's still the case and that the work is interesting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #79:2>
Have you been to Zadia 's wedding yet ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #80:2>
A trip to Puerto Rico sounds amazing -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #81:2>
is your back better enough for you to do all that samba dancing ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #82:2>
It 's great to hear about Michael -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #83:2>
love puts a whole new complexion on things , doesn't it ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #84:2>
As for me , I 'm really happy with James again - very glad that I came back to him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #85:2>
He understands me so well and has that perceptive , peculiar <unclear-character> John-like way of looking at the world that I love .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #86:2>
I saw John the night I moved my things from Cedra Court and found that I didn't actually fancy him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #87:2>
This is a big breakthrough -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #88:2>
I hope it stays that way !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #89:2>
He 's coming here for dinner on Friday night which I 'm really looking forward to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #90:2>
I know he wants to be friends and doesn't want to risk getting intimate again so I don't fear that he will try to tempt me back to him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #91:2>
I 'll let you know how it goes !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #92:2>
Hope the sun keeps shining for you
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #93:2>
Lots of love
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #94:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #97:3>
Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #98:3>
I hope you got our postcard from the USSR .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #99:3>
It was so difficult writing postcards because they 're so small .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #100:3>
The country created such a strong impression on us !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #101:3>
Even on the first evening we were affected by the atmosphere -
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #102:3>
it 's so different from the West .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #103:3>
It 's like I think England would be like if our whole country were run like the NHS !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #104:3>
All our flights within the USSR were really delayed because of the lack of fuel for the planes , queues at the shops like our waiting lists etc ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #105:3>
And now it looks like we got out just in time , what with the army moving in ... only a week after we were there !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #106:3>
We made friends with some Ukranians in Kiev .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #107:3>
I just feel so sorry for them now :
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #108:3>
they 're pro Boris Yeltsin .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #109:3>
Anyway , we 're still recovering from our &lsquo; experience &rsquo; , as our whole tour came down with gastroenteritis .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #110:3>
We 're undergoing tests for giardiasis (
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #111:3>
no doubt you know all about this ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #112:3>
Apart from this we 're both well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #113:3>
How are you ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #114:3>
Looking forward to your move to Cambridge ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #115:3>
You must come &ampersand; see us when you move :
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #116:3>
there 's an hourly bus between Cambridge &ampersand; Bedford .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #117:3>
The earlier in term the better , as we 'll be pretty busy once our course gets back into full swing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #118:3>
I don't know if our kitchen will ever be finished !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #119:3>
There are still 2 major jobs to do , which we 've decided to &lsquo; get the men in &rsquo; for , as we just don't have the time : a new back door-frame &ampersand; step and the window making smaller so it 's up to the sink level .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #120:3>
Even so , we 've still got bare walls &ampersand; haven't fitted all the work-surfaces yet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #121:3>
It 's been 18 months since we started it !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #122:3>
Oh well , I suppose I ought to go to bed , as it 's work tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #123:3>
I 've been back at work 2 days now , but still haven't worked up any enthusiasm !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #124:3>
I find myself pleased when patients fail to attend !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #125:3>
Our staffing levels are down to 30% with waiting lists through the roof !
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #126:3>
However , things are looking up in September with my chief back off maternity leave &ampersand; a couple of new girls starting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #127:3>
Anyway , I really must go now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #128:3>
Keep well &ampersand; let us know when you come to Cambridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-013 #129:3>
We hope to see you soon .

St. Maisal , Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es Orientales , France .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #2:1>
23rd August , 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #3:1>
Dear Yibin ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #4:1>
This is your roving correspondent , now , as you can see , writing to you from France .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #5:1>
I arrived back in Radlett from the West Country on the 10th ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #6:1>
and Jack on the 11th ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #7:1>
and we set off for France on the evening of the 12th .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #8:1>
We had booked ahead for a hotel , and stayed in Calais that night .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #9:1>
Calais is much like any other port ( except in your part of the world of course ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #10:1>
so we stopped there partly for convenience and partly because a former colleague of Jack 's wanted him to see what property was available a little to the south west .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #11:1>
This we did the next day , and were agreeably surprised by the countryside in that area .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #12:1>
Most of Northern France is drab , and we usually travel through it as quickly as possible .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #13:1>
However , this time we were travelling through hilly country , green and fertile , and along an attractive river valley .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #14:1>
The houses , though , tend to be single-storey &lsquo; fermettes &rsquo; constructed out of timber frames with wattle and daub infill and very primitive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #15:1>
The houses from central France on down to the south are usually stone-built and much more attractive and substantial .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #16:1>
I can't remember whether I told you much about ours here in St. Maisal , but it is a terraced village house in the mountains dating back to the eleventh century .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #17:1>
It had been abandoned for many years when we saw it ( we 've learnt since that the sculptor Maillot was born in it ) and was in a terrible state .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #18:1>
When it was inhabited , the ground floor had been used for animals , and the top as a hay loft .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #19:1>
But now , although it 's still simple , it is quite a comfortable &lsquo; pied-a-terre &rsquo; and , best of all , has a little roof terrace with marvellous views -
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #20:1>
you can see right to the coast at Canet and Arg&eacute;l&egrave; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #21:1>
Chris , my eldest son , and his girl-friend Jane , came out by train to join us this week , so they are , at present , sunbathing up there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #22:1>
En route for here , we stopped at Tulles , Bourges , and Albi .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #23:1>
The last is a very attractive town , and we looked at the Cathare Cathar Cathedral and the Toulouse Lautrec museum .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #24:1>
By the time we arrived here , we had had enough of travelling and are content to stay here , especially since it is so blazingly hot .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #25:1>
That seems to be all the Hurst news at the moment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #26:1>
We 'll be back at home at the beginning of September and I 'll contact you soon after that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #27:1>
In the meantime , Yibin , I hope you are enjoying the summer , and getting through your work quota without any difficulties .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #28:1>
With best wishes from Jack and myself , June .

Dear Yibin ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #31:2>
Just a quick line to let you know you 're not forgotten !
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #32:2>
I hope the work is going well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #33:2>
We 've just survived a very hectic end of term , exam marking , and caring for elderly mothers !
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #34:2>
Now we are off to France tomorrow for 3 weeks , where I shall write to you again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #35:2>
Thought you 'd be interested in the enclosed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #36:2>
Have a little correspondence from a friend ( some on cards ) that I 'll be able to let you have for the Survey later on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #37:2>
Regards to Marie , and any other friends around .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #38:2>
All best wishes , June .

Dear Yibin ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #43:3>
Many thanks for your letter of <unclear-character> 6 August .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #44:3>
It is difficult to give you sound advice about your dilemma .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #45:3>
Obviously the York position ( if you were to be offered it ) would give you a better &ampersand; more relaxed style of life .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #46:3>
On the other hand , you have already made a start on your London PhD &ampersand; in a sense would have to make a new start in York .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #47:3>
If I were you , I 'd apply for the York position just for the experience .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #48:3>
If you don't get it , then you have no choice anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #49:3>
If you do , you still have some thinking time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #50:3>
I 'm sorry not to be able to give you any better advice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #51:3>
We are all off on holiday on 31 August for a month .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #52:3>
We 'll look forward to hearing from you on our return .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #53:3>
Viva joins in sending best wishes ,

Dear Yibin ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #58:4>
I hope you are getting on all right .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #59:4>
I am taking it easy myself , at least while the summer weather lasts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #60:4>
Hiromichi says he is coming to the Degree Presentation Ceremony on January 15th , and I have changed my application from December to January so as to be there on the same day as him .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #61:4>
I think Ilse will come on that day , as she knows that Hiro and I will be going then .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #62:4>
June is on holiday at the moment , but I hope when she comes back she will decide to go in January as well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #63:4>
Are you intending to go to one of the ceremonies , and have you applied for a particular one ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #64:4>
It would be nice if you could come in January , since it looks as if most of us will be going on that day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #65:4>
I don't know what C&eacute;cile is doing , and I suppose Philip is still in Russia , being liberated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #66:4>
What marks did you get for your papers ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #67:4>
The ones I know of are : Ilse did very well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #68:4>
I am ashamed of my mark for Grammar .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #69:4>
I shall probably look in at the College once or twice during the autumn , and hope to see you then .

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #74:5>
Congratulations !
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #75:5>
How are you . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #76:5>
I 've been trying to get in touch for months ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #77:5>
I have written about three letters so far with no replys replies &ampersand; guess what , I now know why .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #78:5>
I 've been sending them to 72 St Quintins Ave .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #79:5>
When did you move ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #80:5>
In the letter before last I told you Andy had been made redundant ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #81:5>
in the last letter about 5 weeks ago I told you he had a job in Swindon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #82:5>
I don't suppose you every ever got them though .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #83:5>
I 've been trying for ages to get in touch because my friend Sophie a at work lives near St Quintins Ave.
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #84:5>
&ampersand; I was going up there one evening
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #85:5>
so had hoped to see you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #86:5>
Andy now lives away from home coming back on his off days .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #87:5>
We had hoped he would enjoy it down there so we could move ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #88:5>
I 've always wanted to live in the country .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #89:5>
Unfortunately he 's decided it 's not for him so he 's trying to find a new job up here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #90:5>
I 've decided to go back to college so next week I start my degree course !
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #91:5>
I think I 'm crazy but if I want a career it seems to be the next logical step .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #92:5>
I 've trying tried to get in touch with Janet several times lately but I think she 's moved .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #93:5>
There was a for For Sale sign up two months ago and it 's gone now &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #94:5>
as she never replied to my letters I don't know whether she 's there or not .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #95:5>
I 'm still at Wellcome &ampersand; doing O.K .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #96:5>
I hope to go to the States sometime soon
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #97:5>
but whether it will materialise I don't know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #98:5>
How is Simon &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #99:5>
are you still dotty about him ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #100:5>
Did you know I 've got a cat now ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #101:5>
I still can't believe it sometimes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #102:5>
Andy hates them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #103:5>
He loves Smudge though
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #104:5>
we got her when she was 2 weeks old &ampersand; hand reared her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #105:5>
I think that 's why he likes her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #106:5>
She was so cute when we got her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #107:5>
The vet didn't think she would live
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #108:5>
but she 's nearly 7 months old now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #109:5>
She is a true runt .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #110:5>
She 's still only the size of a 4 month kitten &ampersand; she 's stopped growing now so she 'll always be small .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #111:5>
Anyway , I do hope everything works out well &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #112:5>
send me your telephone No next time
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #113:5>
&ampersand; I 'll give you a ring .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #114:5>
We haven't spoken since the Wedding &ampersand; that 's 2 years next week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #115:5>
I 'll close now
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #116:5>
Take care &ampersand; good luck

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #120:6>
Thanks for your new address .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #121:6>
As you can see I now have a new address but no phone yet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #122:6>
This is Andr&eacute; and my house -
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #123:6>
exciting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #124:6>
We got the keys about 10 days ago and are gradually moving my thing things over there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #125:6>
At the moment we are waiting for carpets to be fitted so we can move my large furniture there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #126:6>
As soon as thats that 's done and Mums Mum 's made the curtains I will move in .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #127:6>
Hopefully in about 2-3 weeks weeks ' time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #128:6>
Until then I will have to live with Mum and Dad and drive to my new job ( which I start next Monday ) at the East Surrey Hospital in Redhill on the Paediatric Unit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #129:6>
I left Kings King 's last week - very sad having been there 6 years to the day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #130:6>
Oh well this is a new era to my life -
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #131:6>
Quite frightening but exciting too .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #132:6>
The date for the wedding has been set for March 14th 1992 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #133:6>
So keep the date free .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #134:6>
Mum 's being really good about the whole thing and very helpful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #135:6>
I never thought the day would come that <unclear-characters> I would be planning my wedding to marry Andr&eacute; with Mum helping .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #136:6>
It 's great but I keep waiting for the bubble to burst .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #137:6>
I 'm really pleased that you have managed to get the funding and look forward to visiting you in Cambridge -
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #138:6>
What does Simon think about it all ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #139:6>
Three years is quite a long time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #140:6>
Rebecca is growing all the time into a beautiful happy little girl who is really trying to speak now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #141:6>
I haven't seen her for a while but will be doing so on Wednesday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #142:6>
Anyway , take care and happy moving to Cambridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #143:6>
See you soon

Dear Tony &ampersand; Joan ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #148:7>
It was truly great to see you both in London and to be able to spend some time with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #149:7>
The boys also enjoyed seeing you immensely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #150:7>
Your generosity always embarasses embarrasses and never ceases to astound me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #151:7>
You are always so quick off the mark .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #152:7>
I suppose it is due to your race track training .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #153:7>
You have started me thinking about the prospect of getting my plate &ampersand; screws removed and attempting to get fit for snowcat skiing , possibly for 1992 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #154:7>
One thing is certain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #155:7>
I never want to ski on a piste again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #156:7>
I am too accident prone .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #157:7>
Meantime we have arranged to take a Winter break in South Africa to compensate for my deprivation this year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #158:7>
We hope that you will not leave it so long again before returning to London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #159:7>
Love from us all .

Dear Gordon ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #163:8>
I was very pleased to have the opportunity to meet you again on your recent visit to London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #164:8>
I hope that you enjoyed your stay .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #165:8>
I did not visit Sun City myself but consulted a friend who has lived in Johannesburg for her opinion .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #166:8>
As anticipated , she queried your desire to stay in Sun City , which has little to offer except gambling and &ldquo; dancing &rdquo; girls .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #167:8>
I did not think that that would be your scene .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #168:8>
I sincerely hope that you will find time to visit other parts of the country and have the following suggestions to make : -
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #169:8>
Jo'burg and Pretoria are nearby and worth a visit but I was advised to avoid the centre at night .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #170:8>
There is a very nice hotel , THE SANTON SUN , on the outskirts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #171:8>
If you have the time ( and can sleep on a train ) take THE BLUE TRAIN to CAPE TOWN 24 Hrs. to do a trip that should take 6 , but the last word in comfort .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #172:8>
You may have to book 1yr. in advance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-014 #173:8>
In Cape Town stay at THE MOUNT NELSON hotel , with a view of Table Mountain , for a few days and hire a car to visit the surrounding vinyards vineyards and countryside .

Dear Zax ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #3:1>
It 's good to hear from you , and to know that you 're all fine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #4:1>
I 'm sorry you had no reply from me to your previous letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #5:1>
I don't know whether I got your letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #6:1>
I certainly haven't received one for a long time , but I do remember answering a letter a fair while ago .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #7:1>
- Anyway , here 's a reply to your recent letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #8:1>
It doesn't seem to me like six years since I was over in Australia .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #9:1>
You must be now the age I was then .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #10:1>
Since at eighteen I was an utterly different person from me at twelve , I imagine that you too have no doubt changed a not inconsiderable amount .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #11:1>
I shall try to prepare myself for you turning up on our shores six foot tall .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #12:1>
I should like to help you as much as I can when you come , but unfortunately our flat is too cramped to accommodate more than me and Zix &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #13:1>
housing is expensive and Zix and I are averagely skint , alas , so we must cohabit in each other 's pockets .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #14:1>
I 'm confident that I can sort out somewhere for you to stay if you let me know how long you can stay in Britain , and when , and on what sort of budget .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #15:1>
Do you plan to live and work in Britain and make a few trips to Denmark , France , Germany and Switzerland ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #16:1>
It would be a shame to come to Europe for a year &ampersand; not spend tons of time travelling round it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #17:1>
At the moment Eastern Europe is both dirt cheap and open to tourists , so there 's plenty of scope for a good time there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #18:1>
You say that you 'll be looking for a &ldquo; more permanent dwelling &rdquo; , so I guess you 're planning a longish stay in Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #19:1>
What sort of a place do you want to stay in ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #20:1>
And what sort of work will you be after ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #21:1>
I suspect that you might be seeking a room in a house of young women in want of nocturnal company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #22:1>
That would be worth coming to Europe for , but , alas , I know of no such desirable residence .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #23:1>
( The night before I and my female housemates were due to move out of a house where I once lived , they implored me to come and frolic , but insanely I stayed up and revised for my maths exam the following day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #24:1>
I shall regret this for the rest of my life !
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #25:1>
- And I got only 20% in the exam despite my heroic and monk-like resistance of temptation in the pursuit of scholarship . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #26:1>
As in London there 's a large community of Australians passing through , you may well be better informed than I about sources of work and accommodation :
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #27:1>
I hope that between us we can come up with something .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #28:1>
Are you keen to live in a large city ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #29:1>
- Are you planning to go to college [ i.e. uni ] in Sydney after the year over here ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #30:1>
Let me know more details about your plans .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #31:1>
In the meantime I send you , Zex , Zox and Zux my best wishes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #32:2>
Dear Dr and Mrs Zaxon ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #33:2>
Zex and I are delighted to accept your invitation to the wedding of Zix and Zox .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #34:2>
I would like , however , to check with you the matter of my dress ( as in &lsquo; clothing &rsquo; ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #35:2>
I think I recall resolving with Zix that I should wear &lsquo; black tie &rsquo; , or rather , the pink bow tie that she bought for me when we went to a ball in Cambridge , plus the same dinner jacket &ampersand; matching pants that I wore on that occasion .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #36:2>
Naturally it is of sentimental significance to me to wear this pink bow tie on the occasion of Zix 's wedding , but as a crown bearer I naturally wish to be dressed appropriately .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #37:2>
If the dress I propose is improper , please do let me know , so I can make arrangements to obtain the suitable garb .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #38:2>
Also , there is the question of a present .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #39:2>
I 've been meaning to ask Zix about this nearer the time , but I know that managing the present list can be quite a complex business , so if it would make life easier for you or Zix to sort out soon what I shall bring , again please do let me know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #40:2>
Zox said to me recently that he doesn't think there 's going to be a rehearsal for the wedding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #41:2>
I rely on your judgement to ascertain that I am capable of bearing the crown without prior briefing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #42:2>
I look forward to the auspicious occasion .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #43:2>

Zax , you angel : I fear events have conspired against me - not , I grant , wholly without a complete absence of resistance from me - to give to you an impression , which would be , I do assure you , entirely false , of my abominable ingratitude for your gift , the occasion and ecstasy of whose receipt have , I fear , remained unknown to you until now .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #47:3>
The post-office appears to have sat on the precious tome for several months , and then sent me a letter telling me so &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #48:3>
I finally got the parcel at the end of August ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #49:3>
when several factors , comprising travels in Italy , firstly , a particularly intense and unwonted burst of scholarly labour , secondly ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #50:3>
, thirdly , what is , I regret I must admit , the nigh inevitable exacerbation of my far from underdeveloped propensity for tardiness and procrastination by my incipiently traditional loss of the letter which accompanied the fruit of your munificence , and wherein rests the only trace of your address available to me ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #51:3>
has , to my embarassment embarrassment , obliged me to address this letter care of Zex and this care of Zix , since I do not have Zex 's address either , perhaps because it too I have mislaid -
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #52:3>
and at this juncture , Zax , it might be perhaps helpful for me to notify you that I am about to deliver you a verb , viz. have , whose subject , viz. factors occurs some not inconsiderable textual distance previous - have all delayed my writing to Edinburgh University Press ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #53:3>
Of course my pleasure was all the more acute since your present was utterly unexpected , and clearly was given with much generosity and consideration .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #54:3>
If you act thus with brief acquaintances such as I would not presume to believe myself aught more than , how fortunate then your friends and your girlfriend ( I fear I forget what the Californian term is ) must be .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #55:3>
Indeed , Zax , I confess that it is a matter of some regret to me that your affections are , I understand , engaged with a person other than my gentle cousin , and that therefore I may not hope that scattered , and bound by the slenderest of threads , though my family is , you might nevertheless at some time , and for what it 's worth - which is , I concede , not much - join it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #56:3>
However , should I briefly tire of cisatlantic life , and discover the means to journey to North America - some conference might perhaps afford the opportunity - then perhaps , I trust , we might meet again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #57:3>
Remember that if you have access to bitnet , or the like , then I am conveniently contactable on JANET as abc@def.ac.xyz , and would be very pleased to hear how you 're doing , whether you 're working for Adobe , and so on and so forth .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #58:3>
Meanwhile , Zax , I remain profoundly grateful for your gift , and pray you will accept my kind regards , my best wishes and any other variety of felicitation ingenuity could contrive and also will convey all these to Zex when you have the opportunity to do so .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #59:4>
Dear Zix ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #60:4>
It 's nice to hear from you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #61:4>
( I 'm afraid I 'd lost your address , but evidently you 're now using the old Zixton one . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #62:4>
I 'm glad you 're having fun , and I suppose that since Zaxtonian jobs require one to work so hard and so constantly it is rather a blessing in disguise to be working freelance for a while .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #63:4>
Do you have long-term plans , such as where ( - and with whom ? - if anyone ) you eventually want to settle ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #64:4>
Has Zox decided where she 's going to live ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #65:4>
Do you have any news of my other cousins ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #66:4>
As for me , work continues , in a half-satisfying , half-terrifying way , and the prospect of my ever earning an adequate living continually appears to recede .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #67:4>
Zux is trying to start a career as a <unclear-word> , but it is too early to say how this attempt will go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #68:4>
You find me preparing for a concert organized by friends at which for half an hour I will be reading one of my poems to an audience 1000% the size of the normal audience for poetry .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #69:4>
It gives me this gnawing feeling of trepidity in my belly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #70:4>
But other nice things are due :
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #71:4>
in a week I 'm off on a freebie to a conference in Zoxtia &ldquo; Zoxon country &rdquo; , where I only have to give a very very short paper , which , thankfully , will be over almost as soon as begun .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #72:4>
And Zux and I will be going to Zixton in June on one of our regular honeymoons and this time she will be giving a paper on Zex Zexon at a conference there .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #73:4>
Zyx/Noun seems to be planning to live in Zyxton and pursue studies on <unclear-word> matters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #74:4>
He is not settled at the moment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #75:4>
Zaax arrived back unannounced from Zaaxtia some months ago -
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #76:4>
I can't remember exactly when it was , but it was after the Gulf war began .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #77:4>
I mean that she arrived back in Western Europe , for she has not really settled in any particular place :
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #78:4>
she 's been touring round the country as part of her work , dropping in on us every now and again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #79:4>
She 's having her personal mail sent to our address ( i. e. the one at the top of this letter ) , so write to her care of me and I 'll forward the letter to wherever she is .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #80:4>
Next to no mail reached her in the Soviet Union &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #81:4>
I 'm sure she doesn't think that you simply didn't bother to write .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #82:4>
Our grandmother also seems to be acquiring incipient senile dementia as well as the psychosis that has been increasing throughout her life .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #83:4>
In her letters to Mum it often seems that she has forgotten that she is writing to her daughter :
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #84:4>
she writes &ldquo; my husband &rdquo; , and I think , though I may be mistaken on this point , she even referred to Mum in the third person .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #85:4>
I sometimes suspect that everyone related to me starts to go bonkers after passing fifty , but I might be wrong , as on the scanty evidence available our grandfather seems to have lived out his days in a state of normality .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #86:4>
Love to you , Zox &ampersand; Zoox -

Tuesday
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #88:5>
An electricity failure in the Financial District yesterday caused panic among some New Yorkers , particularly the 100000 or so who had to be evacuated from the World Trade Center !
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #89:5>
The remainder stood in crowds on street corners , having emerged from the non-operational subway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #90:5>
Sent home from work early because the offices had no power but with no means of getting home , they <unclear-word> decided it was too hot to get anxious &ampersand; just watched the show - a procession of wailing fire engines , police cars &ampersand; ambulances &ampersand; scurrying people .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #91:5>
Traffic lights were out but this isn't London -
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #92:5>
no police with fluorescent armbands to step in &ampersand; create some rules to follow in the chaos -
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #93:5>
it remained chaos .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #94:5>
We managed to get on a very crowded &ampersand; unfortunately not air-conditioned , bus but because of the time it had taken to get anywhere , Jack had no time to lie down so will probably stay in bed today &ampersand; I 'll be out in the big city on my own .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #95:5>
I 'll finish here &ampersand; write again soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #96:5>
I am missing you , keep thinking how good it would be to be here with you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #97:5>
I run through my dilemma again and again , not getting anywhere , separate these 2 questions
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #98:5>
&ldquo; Do I want my relationship with Jack to work ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #99:5>
&ldquo; Do I want a long-term relationship with Jack ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #100:5>
I find the answers incompatible - 2 &ldquo;yes&rdquo;es .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #101:5>
Of course I should consider the 1st alone and not go on to the 2nd unless the answer is &ldquo; no &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #102:5>
But the 1st gives me troubles me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #103:5>
Is it because it hurts me to know how painful it would be for him to say goodbye , remembering his emotion over the phone . ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #104:5>
I 'm frightened l of the idea that I can make him so unhappy and probably influence for the worse his energy for other things , most importantly prospective jobs/business .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #105:5>
I feel that if only he had a home , secure &ampersand; fulfilling job , <unclear-character> close friends , he could bounce back easily .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #106:5>
He wouldn't thank me for continuing to be with him for these reasons -
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #107:5>
it 's so dishonest .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #108:5>
I feel dishonest .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #109:5>
I don't think I shall be nearer any solution when I get back to London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #110:5>
I 'm really sorry .
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #111:5>
Do you hate this uncertainty ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-015 #112:5>
You can be certain that I love you .

Dear Miss Smith-Jones
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #15:2>
Thank you for your faxed message .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #16:2>
Another cashcard has been ordered and will be sent out to you at the end of the month .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #17:2>
I have however reduced the amount to &pound-sign;50 , which I hope will assist you in your budgeting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #18:2>
I regret that I am unable to change the date that the Personal Loan transfer goes through , so you will need to bear this in mind when you calculate the funds you have available to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #19:2>
I see that your statement is in fact despatched to you in the middle of the month and it occurs to me that you might find it of assistance if this was despatched to you at the beginning of the month , I have therefore altered the date of this so that you get it earlier in the month and hope this will prove of some assistance .

This is essentially a very important letter to let you know that I have moved to Johnson Lewis with effect from Monday 29 April .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #26:3>
I feel this will enable me to greatly enhance the service I can provide for you from now on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #27:3>
This move does not in any way affect the business that you have done in the past with the MI Group .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #28:3>
As you can imagine the first few days will be a bit hectic , during which time I will be ringing you , and every client personally to invite you into my office .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #29:3>
In the meantime please be assured that I consider this company to be the finest of its kind &semi; created to offer sound , professional , financial and business advice of the highest possible standard .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #30:3>
If you have any questions then I would be happy to hear from you , but would you please allow me until Tuesday 7 May to give me a little time to sort things out at this end .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #31:3>
My new number is 071 831 4421 .

Mrs. Sheila Shaw , S.P.S. , The Bury , Queensway , Hemel Hempstead .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #37:4>
Dear Sheila ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #38:4>
Having allowed myself a week to recover from my sense of outrage at the treatment of five professional teachers at last week 's interviews for the B posts at the Laurance Haines Base , I feel that I should express my criticisms to you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #39:4>
The majority of the applicants are known to me and I am therefore aware that we possess the highest qualifications for such a post , ie. the R.S.A. Diploma for teachers of pupils with specific learning difficulties - recognised and supported by L.E.A.s nationwide , degrees , including an M.A. in Modern English Language , classroom experience of every possible kind , wide experience and responsibilities in the field of specific learning difficulties and special needs , and current , presumably satisfactory service with the S.P.S .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #40:4>
All this information was clearly available in writing , together with references , rendering an hour 's interview almost superfluous .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #41:4>
Why , then , was it not possible to appoint a team of three people from these candidates ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #42:4>
Each of us would have happily accepted the Panel 's decision , but to appoint no-one from such highly qualified teachers was an insult to us all .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #43:4>
How ironic that those of us who are C.S.Ts have been asked to produce materials for you demonstrating the best in modern practice in the field of specific learning difficulties !
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #44:4>
I understand that most psychologists consider an interviewing panel of six far too unwieldy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #45:4>
I regard this aspect , and others , of the interviews as most unsatisfactory .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #46:4>
It seems to me that if the aim was to appoint a team of teachers - ie. drawing on the assorted strengths of three people - to work with a Leader , the only people necessary to make the selection were the Head and the Leader .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #47:4>
Finally , the candidates were criticised for &lsquo; woolly answers &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #48:4>
These could hardly have been woollier than the questions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #49:4>
It is highly significant that no interviewer could give a clear indication of the proposed aims and workings of the Base .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #50:4>
In fact , more detailed information has since appeared in a school circular from Mr. Dalton .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #51:4>
I consider it is proof of total ineptitude to have wasted the time - a whole day ! - of five professional people .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #52:4>
I hope that when you re-advertise , you find the paragons of virtue you appear to be seeking , and that once appointed they will also prove able to teach .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #53:4>
You will have gathered from the above that I , for one , do not intend to re-apply .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #54:4>

Dear Laura
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #61:5>
As mentioned at the Linguistics Society party last week , the Society is offering continuing membership to undergraduates leaving this summer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #62:5>
This will entitle you to be kept informed of Ling Soc functions next year ( parties , Christmas dinner , etc. ) , so that you can keep in touch with old friends ( and enemies ) , and revisit old haunts should you wish to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #63:5>
If you would like to take advantage of this unique offer , please send us a cheque for &pound-sign;2 , payable to UCL Linguistics Society - or I 'll accept cash if you should run into me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #64:5>
I hope most if not all of you will rejoin - not ( just ) because we need the money , but because everyone agrees that this year 's 3rd years have been good people to have around , and we would all appreciate seeing you again next year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #65:5>
I look forward to hearing from you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #66:5>

<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #70:6>
Dear Miss Tollfree ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #71:6>
Thank you for your letter enquiring about vacancies at the Museum name shop .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #72:6>
We shall be operating a Visions of Japan Shop from September until January 5th .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #73:6>
The shop will open officially on 17th September , but we will require staff for 2 days training the week beginning 2nd September and full time from the week beginning 9th September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #74:6>
The vacancy we have is for an experienced member of staff who can work Monday-Friday 9am-6pm with one day off in the week and either Saturday or Sunday at the weekends .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #75:6>
This means that there is never a chance to have a complete weekend off .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #76:6>
Sunday work is 2pm-6pm but is paid as a full day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #77:6>
The duties will involve stocking , ticketing , manning tills and organisation of cash desks , display of merchandise and , most important , customer service .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #78:6>
It will be very hard work and there will be no opportunities , except for the lunch hour , to participate in Museum activities .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #79:6>
There will also be occasions when we shall require evening work for special events and Club nights .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #80:6>
The salary will be &pound-sign;202 per week , which takes into account the particular problem of working every weekend , and the pressures of exhibition shops .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #81:6>
If you are still interested in applying for the job , please phone on 123456 to make a time for an interview .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #82:6>

Re :

Following John Brown 's telephone conversation with Joe Bloggs of 20 June 1991 , I have now been in touch with all the production departments for the programmes numbered 1-14 on your list ( the commentaries ) and , so far , I have the agreement of four out of eight of them to you using the broadcasts subject to the consent of those commentators who own the copyright in their contributions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #93:7>
I have yet to hear from the other four .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #94:7>
In the meantime , I can give you the following list of commentators who are on contracts under which they retain copyright : .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #95:7>
If you write a letter to each of them requesting permission to use the relevant broadcast material , I shall forward them and collect their replies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #96:7>
When I spoke to you yesterday I said I would have another word with John Smith about the project .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #97:7>

Dear Sirs ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #102:8>
You ought to be aware of a potentially serious problem caused by a recurring leak from a bathroom in 76 Smith Mansions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #103:8>
It regularly penetrates the floor and has damaged the ceiling in our bathroom , which is immediately below .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #104:8>
The leak has been long-standing but earlier this year we accepted assurances that it had been cured .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #105:8>
We even redecorated the bathroom .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #106:8>
Very soon afterwards we discovered that nothing had in fact been done to resolve the problem .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #107:8>
Verbal protests to the occupier proved useless and in February we ascertained that a flat was leased by Johnson and the occupier was merely a tenant .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #108:8>
There has been a succession of tenants since .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #109:8>
I have written a number of times to Johnson and been assured that remedial action will be taken .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #110:8>
It has not and now I feel it is necessary to take formal legal action to protect my own property and to stop the nuisance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #111:8>
You , I think , ought to be aware of the situation because I believe there is a genuine long-term possiblilty of dry rot developing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #112:8>
We have taken the precaution of having part of the ceiling renewed but the leaks continue and increase in severity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #113:8>
Patently Johnson 's are not interested and will do nothing until compelled by the law .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #114:8>
Yours sincerely ,

Dear Sir ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #129:10>
As you are aware further troops are being sent to the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #130:10>
123 Squadron Army Air Corps has been tasked to go on 10 December 1990 as the first element of Army Aviation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #131:10>
This being the case we are likely to be getting a lot of press coverage .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #132:10>
The Squadron is being sent to perform in the helicopter anti-tank role .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #133:10>
The full complement of the Squadron is eighty six eighty-six men .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #134:10>
It is probable that we will be there for at least six months .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #135:10>
As such , there will be a need to break up the intense training with various forms of entertainment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #136:10>
I am sure you will understand that the need to maintain morale is of paramount importance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #137:10>
This is especially so with our Christmas being spent away from home .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #138:10>
I would be very grateful if you would contribute in some way to the maintaining of the Squadron 's morale .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #139:10>
I can assure you that any sort of gesture would be most appreciated by all of us in 123 Squadron .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #140:10>
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future .
<ICE-GB:W1B-016 #141:10>
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #4:1>
I enclose a signed copy of the arrangements for the First Aid Course at University College London on 11 and 12 February 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #5:1>
Please note that I have been in touch with your Finance Department as I only received the notification today as the College has been closed since 21 December and re-opened today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #6:1>
It is already less than 6 weeks until the date of the course but the payment and invoice should reach you about the end of next week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #7:1>
Your Finance Department have confirmed that this will be acceptable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #8:1>
Can you please let me have more information about the structure of the course so that I can make appropriate arrangements for morning coffee and afternoon tea .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #9:1>
I have booked rooms in Ramsay Hall , 20 Maple Street , W1 and blackboards will be provided .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #10:1>
Please let me know if there is anything else that you need .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #11:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #16:2>

I enclose a draft Sharps Policy and a Protocol for Bleeding Human Volunteers for consideration by the Biological Safety Sub-Committee .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #22:3>
The College hasn't had a formal sharps policy before , and this draft has been prepared to fit in with the Bloomsbury Health Authority policy , as many of the Medical School work in both organisations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #23:3>
The Protocol for Bleeding Human Volunteers would replace the previous protocol , which needs updating .

Re : Occupational Health Service , 3 Gower Place 4th floor shower room
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #28:4>
Thank you for sending plans for a new shower room .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #29:4>
What you are proposing would not be suitable as it is using my consulting room as a thoroughfare .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #30:4>
Also I note that the floor plan that you are working from is grossly inaccurate , showing an additional room that does not exist , showing a different distribution of space in the rooms and giving different numbers from the numbers that we have on the doors .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #31:4>
The Occupational Health Service has suffered from having acquired a room at a time , with each room adapted to provide for what was most urgently needed at the time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #32:4>
There was no overall planning to use the space which eventally eventually became available in a sensible way .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #33:4>
Unfortunately when Mr Smith came over he was not expecting to have any discussion with me and I had not been advised of his visit , so we had a rather confused conversation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #34:4>
It would be a great help if we could have further discussions on the utilisation of space on the 4th floor .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #35:4>
If we started by explaining the functions of the department and what type of space is needed an architect would be in a better position to advise us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #36:4>
I look forward to hearing from you further .

1. The students have lectures on AIDS during the second year ( ie the year leading up to electives )
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #63:7>
2. When they attend the Occupational Health Service for immunisations prior to setting off on their electives they are given very explicit information on a one to one basis and in particular relation to their destination .

<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #73:9>
Thank you for discussing our needs on the telephone today .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #74:9>
This is to confirm that I would like to enquire whether it would be possible to employ a First Aider for a series of days during our examination period in May and June as we will be using several examination halls which will be too far away from the main College campus for us to provide an adequate first aid service to them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #75:9>
The outlying examination halls will be located at Liverpool Street , Red Lion Square and Theobalds Road .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #76:9>
The First Aider would be needed in case any of the students were taken ill in the middle of an examination .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #77:9>
The most frequent occurrences are &ldquo; exam nerves &rdquo; , headaches , diarrhoea and vomiting , and other minor ailments .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #78:9>
In these circumstances we always try to enable the student to complete the examination if at all possible , so the First Aider might be asked to bring the student back to the Occupational Health Service in the College by taxi .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #79:9>
I would be grateful if you would let me know how much it would cost to employ a First Aider on a daily basis .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #80:9>
As I said on the 'phone , we have not reached any decision about this and it would be very helpful if we were able to discuss it further .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #81:9>
I look forward to hearing from you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #82:9>

It is quite a tough course , and I hope this hasn't put you off having another go .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #87:10>
As your current certificate doesn't expire until June I will try to get you onto another refresher course before then .

This is to confirm my agreement with the plan for the 4th floor of the Health Centre Building - amendment &lsquo; B &rsquo; dated 5 March 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #98:12>
The area in 401 marked &lsquo; carpet area ( to be confirmed ) &rsquo; should not be carpeted -
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #99:12>
please leave a sealed vinyl floor covering .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #100:12>
As discussed , the work should not take place during the exam period as we may have sick students sitting their exams here .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #101:12>
The dates to be avoided are March 20 to 21 and April 22 to June 21 inclusive .

This is to confirm our telephone conversation yesterday morning regarding first aiders and appointed persons .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #106:13>
At present you have 2 first aiders , and this is acceptable as a minimum , but in addition to them you need some appointed persons , preferably 5 so as to cover all locations and allow for absences .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #107:13>
When you have identified these people please ask either Mrs Robinson or myself to come over and have a short session with them ( approximately 1 hour ) to discuss their role and responsibilities .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #108:13>
I hope that next term we will be running an emergency first aid course for appointed persons ( one day ) , and some or all your new appointed persons should attend this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #109:13>
When we are able to run a four day first aid course hopefully two of your appointed persons will be willing to do this and become qualified first aiders .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #110:13>
You will need to consider out of hours working , as there should be access to a first aider if people are carrying out hazardous practical work out of hours .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #111:13>

Thank you very much for discussing First Aid provision in your department yesterday ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #157:21>
I found it very helpful as several points were raised which needed clarification .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #158:21>
I think I have misled you over whether students should be allowed to use the premises out of hours .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #159:21>
The policy document on out of hours working states that students should not be in college premises outside normal working hours unless there is a responsible member of staff in the department .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #160:21>
The document also gives guidelines for staff who occupy the premises out of hours , and we discussed yesterday the need for staff to be aware of the local arrangements for obtaining help in the event of an accident or sudden illness .
<ICE-GB:W1B-017 #161:21>
I don't think that this necessitates all the staff being formerally formally given the role of appointed persons .

I have your name on a list of people who need to do a 4 day First Aid course because you take students on field trips .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #3:1>
I am unable to arrange a course in the College at present , and the best thing will be for you to go on a course at a St. John Ambulance centre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #4:1>
Their Central London centre is fully booked at present and only offering places when they get cancellations , but they have places available in their peripheral centres and as you live out of London this may in any case be more convenient for you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #5:1>
Could you please ring the St. John central office , tel. 071 258 3456 and book yourself on a suitable course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #6:1>
Please say that you are from University College and give my name so that the bill comes here .

I have been in touch with her and said that if she wishes to make another appointment she should ring in and do so herself , as I think that in this way she is more likely to keep the appointment .

I now have a firm date for a First Aid Refresher Course to be held in University College on 25 &ampersand; 26 September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #64:11>
I understand from our recent telephone conversation that your last certificate dates from September 1988 and that you would like to renew this by taking the refresher course this September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #65:11>
Would you kindly confirm that you will be able to attend on 25 &ampersand; 26 September .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #66:11>
If you are not available on these dates please let me know as soon as possible , and I will try to make other arrangements for you .

Many thanks for your letter of 21 June .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #82:14>
I am glad to hear that the off site locations were well looked after by St. John Ambulance personnel .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #83:14>
Things seemed to go reasonably smoothly at this end , but I would like to ask you to consider two points for next year :
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #84:14>
1.
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #85:14>
Some problems arose because tutors started making arrangements for sick students before the letter went out advising them on the procedure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #86:14>
Can we please send the letter out much earlier next year , perhaps the end of January .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #87:14>
2.
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #88:14>
We still had a few problems over the lack of medical information about students sitting with us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #89:14>
The request for students to send or take a medical certificate to the Occupational Health Service is not specific enough as a certificate may just state that a student is unfit to sit their examins examinations in the main halls .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #90:14>
We would get more information if they were asked for a doctor 's letter to the College Occupational Physician .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #91:14>
Many thanks for all your help .

I believe that your First Aid certificate dates from September 1988 , and you therefore need to do a Requalification Course before the end of September this year if you wish to renew your certificate .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #96:15>
There will be a course in the College on 25 &ampersand; 26 September , and I would be grateful if you would let me know whether you can attend this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #97:15>
It is a two day course and you need to attend both days .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #98:15>

Dear John
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #102:16>
Thank you for your letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #103:16>
I am so glad to hear that everyone is safe and sound , and that life can now go back to normal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #104:16>
As I said when you were here in November , I would be very interested in the idea of a return visit by the company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #105:16>
There are , however , a couple of obstacles to be overcome first , which concern available dates and financial arrangements .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #106:16>
At the moment , it does not look likely that I will have any available space during October/November -
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #107:16>
this would mean looking at dates next year , which would be OK by me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #108:16>
The matter of money may be slightly more complicated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #109:16>
The Bloomsbury was hired by the Barbican Centre , in order to provide a venue for your company .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #110:16>
This is the way that we normally operate , with our basic daily hire rate of &pound-sign;750.00 Monday to Saturday , and &pound-sign;920.00 on a Sunday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #111:16>
This includes two technical staff , all Front of House and Box Office staff as well as the full ticket selling service .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #112:16>
It does not include publicity costs , although we would be prepared to help out with the publicity arrangements as much as possible .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #113:16>
If you were not able to work on this basis , then it might be possible to split the Box Office
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #114:16>
( we would perhaps be able to operate a 60/40 split in your favour ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #115:16>
This would have to be on the understanding that the Yiddish Theatre Company would be responsible for all production costs ie set , transport , travel and accommodation etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #116:16>
In this instance , the Bloomsbury would be able to help with certain publicity costs , namely printing of posters and leaflets and distribution/mailing lists .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #117:16>
We would still not have any funds for advertising , however , as this is always very costly , and the money could not be made back over such a short time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #118:16>
My feelings are that you really need someone to finance the visit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #119:16>
Do you have anyone in mind ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #120:16>
Perhaps it might be worth speaking to Mary Brown , as she might have some ideas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #121:16>
In any case , these are my initial thoughts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #122:16>
It may be that the potential obstacles are not insurmountable problems , in which case I look forward to hearing from you to discuss things further .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #123:16>
Best wishes to everyone .

Dear Joseph ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #139:18>
Following our telephone conversation yesterday , I am writing to confirm that the theatre will be undergoing a reorganisation of staffing following the departure of the Deputy Manager William Brown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #140:18>
In addition to advertising for a new Front of House Manager ( see attached copy of advertisement ) , the Theatre Secretary Helen Black will be upgraded to Office Manager to take account of the additional administrative responsibilities she will be undertaking as a result of William 's departure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #141:18>
We will be bringing in someone to help with general office duties on an ad hoc basis .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #142:18>
I would like to place Helen on CRA Grade 3 Point 5 ( currently at 9,584 per annum , exclusive of London Weighting ) starting 1 May 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #143:18>
As you can see , the new Front of House Manager will be graded somewhere between CRA Grade 3 Point 3 and Point 6 , depending on experience .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #144:18>
The combined salaries of the Front of House Manager will be less than the current combined salaries of Deputy Manager and Theatre Secretary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #145:18>
Any surplus will cover additional expenditure on office help and freelance publicity services .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #146:18>
As I explained , I have already discussed these proposals with Professor Williams , the Chairman of the JCT , and I have his authority on behalf of the committee to proceed as necessary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #147:18>
Please let me know if you need any further information .
<ICE-GB:W1B-018 #148:18>

You could also stay and watch the show on Friday evening .

Dear Mr Ishikawa

DILLONS IN TOKYO
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #15:2>
Thank you for your letter proposing a branch of Dillons dealing with customers customers ' orders only at or for Tokyo University .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #16:2>
You are quite correct when you state that we have considerable experience as University Booksellers and this is usually to sell a full range of books acquired for use at any University where we are represented .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #17:2>
We would be interested in a University Bookstore at Sanshu University , or having exclusive rights to supply English Text Books direct to you from Dillons in London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #18:2>
From our Gower Street Bookstore in London we supply English Texts to the four corners of the World .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #19:2>
We could formalise our arrangement with Tokyo via yourself , if your colleagues are prepared to fax their orders direct to London for immediate despatch back to Japan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #20:2>
If you could explain how we can best organise a Customer Order Service based in London and despatched at London prices , then we will be able to supply you and as many of your colleagues who wish to join in on a regular basis .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #21:2>
There are few problems at the London end , but we would need to know who we are communicating through at the Tokyo end .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #22:2>
As I have already stated , we would be prepared to consider a full bookshop operation at your University if there is an opportunity available .

<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #26:2>
I will also await any further information from you concerning the possibility of a full bookshop on your Campus .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #27:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #34:3>
Dear Ms Younger ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #35:3>
Thank you for your letter of 3 August together with details of the Knitting and Stitching Show which is to take place at Alexandra Palace , 4-7 October this year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #36:3>
While it does sound very intriguing , I have to say no this time around for two reasons .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #37:3>
Firstly , we simply have no promotional budget left &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #38:3>
our financial year is the calendar year and so from about now onwards our budget is already allocated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #39:3>
Secondly , personnel will also be a problem .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #40:3>
October is a bad time for people to be away out of the bookshop , because academic departments are frantic with the start of the University year , while the more general departments , such as the one that would be involved in your Show , are a little less frantic with the commencement of the University year , but are completely occupied in Christmas stock .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #41:3>
So I am sorry to disappoint you , but do please bear us in mind for the next year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #42:3>
Now that we have had advance warning , I have put your information around the relative departments and we could build it in to next year 's budget .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #43:3>

Dear Mr White
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #82:8>
Thank you for your letter of 6 April , addressed to my colleague Julie Brown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #83:8>
I was interested to learn that you are providing walking/themed holidays in the Yorkshire Dales , Moors , Wolds and Coast .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #84:8>
We do not , in fact , have any immediate plans to produce a new publication on walking in Britain but I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the most recent brochure we have produced on the subject .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #85:8>
I will certainly add your name to our mailing list of walking tour operators and , should we go ahead with a new leaflet , you will automatically receive full details .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #86:8>
I would be very interested to see a copy of any promotional literature you may have produced on your current programme of walks -
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #87:8>
we can also arrange to send up to 100 copies of any leaflet free of charge to our network of offices overseas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #88:8>

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #99:9>
Thank you for your letter of 5th February .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #100:9>
Yes indeed , BMIF has agreed that Britain should be the official &lsquo; Partner Country &rsquo; for the Duesseldorf International Boat Show in 1992 , and Joe Bloggs , their Export Manager has already contacted me for an exploratory chat on the subject .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #101:9>
I certainly agree with the views expressed in your letter , that it will afford us an opportunity to break through to a new level of coverage of holidays afloat in Britain , and I very much hope that I shall be able to devote extra time and effort in this direction for &lsquo; boot 92 &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #102:9>
It sounds an excellent idea to take a boat over to Duesseldorf , and I do hope that the boat owners will be able to undertake this project .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #103:9>
I do know that BMIF will be looking for a great deal of sponsorship and assistance from the industry to make Britain 's partnership at &lsquo; boot &rsquo; a successful one , and I am sure they would be delighted to welcome you aboard .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #104:9>
I would be very pleased to meet you and other representatives of the British boating holiday industry to help take things forward a stage &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #105:9>
however , I hope you will understand if I suggest that we leave this until a little later in the year , say April or May .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #106:9>
With best wishes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #107:9>

As you know , BTA is unable to subsidise Northern Ireland in the same way as mainland Britain .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #129:10>
As the Waterfront Britain Consortium is currently run as a joint marketing scheme with 25% BTA support , we are obliged to add a small supplementary charge to your membership fee &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #130:10>
this is reflected in the 50% stage invoice enclosed with this letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #131:10>
Thank you for your support , and I look forward to working with you on Waterfront Britain .

<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #143:11>
When we met at &lsquo; boot &rsquo; in January , you mentioned that you were planning a visit to Britain to gather information for an article in &lsquo; Skipper &rsquo; magazine Skipper √≠ magazine Skipper on cruising in British waters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #144:11>
I wonder if you now have some idea of when you are coming , and which areas you would like to cover .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #145:11>
Members of the &lsquo; Waterfront Britain &rsquo; group Waterfront Britain √≠ will be pleased to look after you and arrange visits to marinas , boatyards , yacht charter companies etc , and possibly some sailing , if you wish .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #146:11>
I enclose a further copy of the current brochure , with an amended list of members for 1992 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #147:11>
There will be a 3-day group visit of journalists through NOWEA/BMIF and ourselves in September , possibly to include a visit to the Southampton Boat Show , hosted by BMIF .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #148:11>
However , from what you told me in January , three days would not be sufficient for you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #149:11>
Please could you let me know as soon as possible if you require assistance with your trip , and I and my colleagues at the various waterfront destinations will be delighted to help .
<ICE-GB:W1B-019 #150:11>
With best wishes .

My dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #6:1>
Thank you for your letter of 9 May .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #7:1>
I am genuinely sorry to have been the cause of burnt midnight oil and I am most grateful for your kindness .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #8:1>
I hear what you say but I 'm afraid I still think your accounts people have got it wrong .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #9:1>
Either that or my ( admittedly simplistic ) approach is faulty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #10:1>
I bill LB for two things : fees ( plus VAT ) and expenses .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #11:1>
I keep them separate to simplify VAT calculations so I will review them separately .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #12:1>
I will then review the payments made to LB &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #13:1>
the totals should balance , whichever method you use .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #14:1>
Perhaps you can get them to balance ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #15:1>
I can't .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #16:1>
Add 1,152.29 which you say I was overpaid in 1990 :
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #17:1>
TOTAL received from LB Jan - May 1991 : 26,061.47
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #18:1>
There is a difference , by my reckoning , of 862.98 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #19:1>
Invoice 031 has still to be paid , so deduct this ( 481.50 ) and there is still a shortfall of 381.48 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #20:1>
Perhaps this represents cash advanced ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #21:1>
If so this cash was expended , of course , on tips , taxis etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #22:1>
It was certainly not expended on personal items .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #23:1>
I keep personal expenditure and that in support of LB entirely separate .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #24:1>
I am not privy to the workings of your accounts people so I cannot judge where they got their figures from .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #25:1>
The last thing I want to do is to put you to any more trouble personally .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #26:1>
I am therefore prepared to write off this amount to experience although I think it is a pity that LB is the only major corporation I have worked for where this has been a problem .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #27:1>
Now that we have adopted a system of my paying all expenses and then claiming , the problem should be solved .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #28:1>
Nevertheless , I hope these will be paid promptly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #29:1>
I will endeavour to provide supporting vouchers but I hope my word will be sufficient for such items as tips , the odd coffee , local newspapers , taxis ( for short journeys , not for any exceptional ones of course ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #30:1>
Please remind your accounts people that invoice 031 is still outstanding and then we will draw a line under the whole business and start anew .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #31:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #37:2>
I am interested in having The Old Rectory connected to a Digital Communicator .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #38:2>
Is there an installation fee ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #39:2>
Will the rental remain at &pound-sign;2.99 per week for the whole of the five year commitment ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #40:2>
In other words , are there any additional costs to those stated in your letter ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #41:2>
I need clarification on these points before deciding finally whether to proceed .

Dear Sir ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #48:3>
I have just had an <unclear-word> at the Nuffield Hospital in Shrewsbury .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #49:3>
Before the problem was dealt with ( and cured I hope ) , I had had a course of 4 treatments from a physiotherapist ( a referral by my doctor ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #50:3>
It was in fact the physiotherapist who confirmed the suspicion of the doctor that it was a cartilage problem .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #51:3>
I enclose the bill and would be grateful for settlement .

I refer to my letter of 14 November 1989 which remains unacknowledged .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #59:4>
I am now very concerned about the inadequacy of the electricity supply and the failure of MEB to improve it despite promises to do so .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #60:4>
It is now ten months since my original request .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #61:4>
Unless I receive an immediate assurance that an improvement will be made , I will have no alternative but to take my complaint to the appropriate authority .

Caroline has just told me she has spoken to you about the problem with a possible housing development opposite us in Shipley .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #68:5>
I am delighted you are willing to help and advise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #69:5>
I attach copies of the letter I wrote to the Chief Planning Officer when I learned of the proposal and his reply .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #70:5>
I am not happy that our objections are being given proper consideration .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #71:5>
Caroline has told you that I have retained Smith , Jones &ampersand; Wilson and their planning consultant , Joe Bloggs , to advise but I think it also needs a good legal expert to ferret out some of the possible sinister details .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #72:5>
I cannot think of anyone better qualified .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #73:5>

<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #81:6>
Dear Sir
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #82:6>
I have been aware for some time of an intention to build five houses in Shipley &ldquo; between The Old Rectory and Bowling Green Farm &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #83:6>
Like most of us , I had assumed this meant a site in the middle of the village next to the church where there is a flat area big enough and ideal for the purpose .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #84:6>
I was therefore very surprised to learn that the plan quoted above had been changed ( without reference to the Parish Council ) and that the field opposite to The Old Rectory had been earmarked instead and that this proposal is up for discussion at a planning meeting on Tuesday evening .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #85:6>
I wish to register an immediate and formal objection to this new proposal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #86:6>
My principal objection is that any new building opposite the Old rectory will destroy a view generally reckoned to be one of the most attractive in Shropshire .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #87:6>
The Old Rectory was the birthplace in 1792 of Archibald Alison the distinguished historian and man of letters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #88:6>
He recorded his famous description of the view in his autobiography and it is extraordinary that it has changed so little in the past 200 years &semi; something which cannot be said of many famous views in England .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #89:6>
It would be curious to celebrate Alison 's bi-centenary in two years years 's time by destroying something so very dear to his heart .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #90:6>
English Heritage have recognised the beauty of the view as have an increasing number of tourists who pause outside the house to share it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #91:6>
The proposed site is also not ideal from the construction point of view &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #92:6>
it slopes steeply &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #93:6>
road access is difficult and bends in the road already make it dangerous .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #94:6>
I emphasise that I welcome a proposal for low cost housing in Shipley but like the rest of the villagers , I believe the selection of the site must be careful and sensitive to an area of outstanding natural beauty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #95:6>
Above all we should be given a proper opportunity to discuss proposals in detail .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #96:6>
I hope this objection will be sufficient to cause any preliminary decision to be reviewed and that Shipley Parish Council will be fully consulted before the matter is taken any further .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #97:6>
I am copying this letter to the Parish Council .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #98:6>

<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #102:7>
Dear Mr Jones ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #103:7>
I am sorry to have hounded you over the past few days but I appreciate the opportunity to warn CPRE of a potentially disastrous development proosed proposed for the village of Shipley .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #104:7>
I hope you will be able to give us moral support in our fight to avoid one of the few remaining unspoilt communities in this beautiful area of Shropshire being sacrificed to the developers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #105:7>
The recently published Blacktown and Whitetown Rural Area Local Plan includes a proposal to build five houses in the field opposite the Old School House in Shipley .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #106:7>
Most of the village ( including the Parish Council which was not consulted ) was unaware of the intention to do this and is horrified at the prospect of having a block of five dwellings ( bungalows ? ) in such a prominent position on top of Shipley Ridge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #107:7>
site selected offers magnificent views of the surrounding countryside but is itself visible from miles around , especially from below - from Greentown , Black Moor and Redtown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #108:7>
Many of us have reservations about whether any new dwellings are necessary in Shipley but do not object to low-cost housing in principle if it can be demonstrated that it is needed for the local community , as opposed to the usual beneficiaries of speculative developments .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #109:7>
The roads in the area are narrow , dangerous and overcrowded and simply cannot cope with any significant increase in traffic .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #110:7>
If houses are to be built , however , they should be sited and built in keeping with the character of the area as a whole .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #111:7>
There are hardly two houses side by side in Shipley , let alone a group of five .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #112:7>
There are more suitable alternative sites for individual dwellings which the Parish Council already has in mind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #113:7>
Many of the residents of Shipley are objecting to the proposal as are individuals from surrounding communities for whom Shipley Ridge is the scenic backdrop &semi; or who simply do not want to see a totally unspoilt area fall victim to the developers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #114:7>
The Chairman of the Parish Council and our other Parish Councillor are organising resistance within the village &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #115:7>
I have taken a lead in seeking support from organisations and individuals outside but concerned .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #116:7>
I have retained a solicitor to act on our behalf &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #117:7>
it was he who recommended that CPRE should be contacted .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #118:7>
( I do belong to English Heritage but this sort of problem is not really for them . )
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #119:7>
I should declare a personal interest in the proposed development in that The Old Rectory will be one of the houses most directly affected .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #120:7>
The house is not a listed property ( we have always felt grateful for this ) but selection for listing in this area has been curiously arbitrary , based exclusively on whether a building is in stone .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #121:7>
However the house has important historical associations as you can see from the attached brief .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #122:7>
Alison 's bi-centenary falls in 1992 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #123:7>
it would be curious to mark it by despoiling a view he recorded so vividly almost two centuries ago .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #124:7>
Ideally you ought to visit Shipley to see just what is at stake .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #125:7>
If you could spare the time to do so we would be very grateful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #126:7>
I have to go abroad on business next week but my wife will be here and she can also introduce you to the Parish Council if you wish .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #127:7>

Dear Tom ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #133:8>
I enclose a copy of a letter from the Chairman of the local CPRE about our problem with the Rural Area Local Plan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #134:8>
It is self-explanatory .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #135:8>
In para 3 John Smith recommends seeking the support of local councillors .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #136:8>
Perhaps Joe Bloggs could advise on this
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #137:8>
I am not keen to see the matter become a party issue .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #138:8>
More to the point is the identification of the proposal 's supporters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #139:8>
Those ( 6 out of 12 ) marked &lsquo; F &rsquo; are members of the extensive Jones family which owns the proposed development site .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #140:8>
Wilson Contract Services are the Jones &rsquo; advisers but I understand Mr Wilson may be on or work for the County Council .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #141:8>
R. Williams is the local manager of Leighton Rock and believed to be behind the proposal in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #142:8>
Is it worth drawing the Council 's attention to the family and business affiliations of the supporters now or do you advise waiting for the Inquiry to use the information ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #143:8>
Presumably Joe Bloggs will be obtaining a list of official objectors to enable a closer coordination of effort .

<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #147:9>
Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #148:9>
I have been strongly advised to raise an official objection to the Council about the way you use the field which borders on our garden and paddock .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #149:9>
I am told by a number of experts that its present use constitutes a breach of the planning regulations and , on application , the Council would certainly order it to be cleared .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #150:9>
John , we have been neighbours for twenty years and throughout that time I have bent over backwards to avoid a dispute over what is generally acknowledged to be an awful eyesore .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #151:9>
I have even grown a high hedge to shield us from it although this has meant sacrificing our splendid view of Hilltop Edge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #152:9>
I have not noticed that any restraint on my part has been matched by an equal willingness on yours to show consideration to any of your neighbours where you park farm machinery , old vehicles or other junk .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #153:9>
As I say , I have been advised to take the matter to the Council .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #154:9>
However I would prefer to avoid resort to legal expedients and the acrimony caused if it can be avoided :
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #155:9>
I am sure that , particularly at the moment , you do not want the Council on your neck either .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #156:9>
I would like therefore to propose a solution which would enable you to store what farm machinery and other useful junk ( whether for cannibalisation or sentimental value ) but allow us to open up the view from our garden .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #157:9>
If you would agree formally to limit the parking of farm machinery and junk to the area shown on the enclosed map , I would agree not to take the matter up with the Council .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #158:9>
I will even assist in the clearing up operation if you want .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #159:9>
This sensible compromise would allow you to keep what you need in a convenient place and allow us to lower the height of the hedge and enjoy the view again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #160:9>
I know you set great store on your own view of Hilltop Edge so I am sure you will understand our desire to enjoy it as well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #161:9>
In the circumstances I hope you can agree to my very reasonable proposition .
<ICE-GB:W1B-020 #162:9>

Dear Joe
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #2:1>
Following our telephone conversation earlier today , I am putting my various insurance queries in writing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #3:1>
For the purposes of clarity I include the two clauses relating to insurance matters , which appear in our contract issued to all visiting companies :
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #X4:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #X5:1>

<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #6:1>
My queries are as follows :
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #7:1>
1 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #8:1>
Is the sum of 250,000 quoted in section i ) sufficient ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #9:1>
It was updated a few years ago and hasn't been changed since .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #10:1>
2 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #11:1>
Could you explain in plain English exactly what the Visiting Management is being asked to insure itself against in section j ) ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #12:1>
cont ...
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #13:1>
3 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #14:1>
In relation to query 2 , would it be possible for a Visiting Management to insure itself against third party risks through UCL for its run at the Bloomsbury ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #15:1>
The event in question would be a musical performance running from 9-14 April and involving several musicians .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #16:1>
Insurance would be taken out by James Brown , who is acting as the Visiting Management .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #17:1>
If this looks possible , then I can get further information for you as to just how many people would be involved etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #18:1>
Perhaps you could find out from the insurers exactly what they would need to know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #19:1>
Thank you for your help in these matters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #20:1>

Dear James
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #24:2>
As promised , I am writing to confirm that the Bloomsbury Theatre will unfortunately not be available for hire to London College next year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #25:2>
Over the last year I have revised the theatre 's policy on Sunday bookings , due to our extremely busy programme of events .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #26:2>
As a result , we are now only accepting Sunday bookings of a very straightforward nature , involving minimum setting up time and the barest of technical requirements .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #27:2>
We are also trying to take only bookings involving a small number of performers , as our dressing room space is limited and tends to be already occupied by those performing during the week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #28:2>
In this way I am able to limit the burden placed on the theatre staff , while still bringing in much needed revenue for the theatre .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #29:2>
I hope you are able to find another performance space for next year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #30:2>

Dear Laura ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #34:3>
I am writing to set straight the query you had in April of this year regarding three so-called unpaid invoices of 1990 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #35:3>
Firstly , the invoice dated 1st January 1990 for &pound-sign;29.90 was paid together with another invoice dated 30th January 1990 for &pound-sign;26.19 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #36:3>
The cheque for the total of &pound-sign;56.09 ( dated 14th February 1990 ) was cashed at Nat West Bank on 22nd February .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #37:3>
The number of the cheque is 123456 and the branch it was cashed at is Old Market Square branch , Basingstoke , Hampshire ( sort code : - 12-34-56 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #38:3>
Secondly , we could not trace the invoice dated 22nd March 1990 for &pound-sign;43.13 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #39:3>
You sent us a copy of the invoice ( no. 12345 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #40:3>
Please find enclosed cheque no. 123456 , dated 21st May 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #41:3>
Thirdly , as I have already confirmed on the telephone , the invoice dated 1st October 1990 for &pound-sign;29.90 , was paid by cheque ( dated 30th November 1990 ) number 654321 and was banked by you on 10th December of the same year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #42:3>
I hope this clears up any queries you had .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #43:3>

Dear Tom
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #47:4>
I have just met with Select who will be supplying us with our Box Office Computer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #48:4>
It appears that the network manager , which was to be sited in the Box Office itself will now be in the general office along with the third terminal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #49:4>
This is being done to increase the amount of space available in the already over crowded Box Office .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #50:4>
I hope this does not cause too many problems for you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #51:4>
The number of sockets we require remains the same .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #52:4>
I also wanted to mention the matter of trunking .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #53:4>
Both the possible contractors I met this week spoke about putting in trunking ready for the ethernet cabling .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #54:4>
One company said it wouldn't be a problem and the other said there wasn't enough room .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #55:4>
It now appears that the area they were looking at will be occupied by various pieces of the equipment , so even if there was enough room now this won't be the case after installation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #56:4>
I did explain to both companies that I would know more after my meeting with Select and I hope that I will be consulted again before the work is carried out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #57:4>
Once again , thanks for all your help in this matter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #58:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #61:5>
Dear Mr Smith
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #62:5>
Following from our conversation , I would like to reiterate my complaint with regard to a stocktake carried out on 14th May by Mr John Brown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #63:5>
Although I was in the theatre on that day I was otherwise engaged in the building and not with Mr Smith for the stocktake .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #64:5>
Nevertheless , Mary Black our Administrative Assistant provided Mr Smith with the information necessary for the stocktaking .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #65:5>
As Mary explained to Mr Smith on the telephone just before he arrived , she had not done a stocktake before and asked him to bear with her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #66:5>
On his arrival and indeed for the majority of the day Mr Smith was pleasant .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #67:5>
However when there emerged some confusion with regard to the sale of a supposed sixty bottles of lime cordial - which turned out to have been misread by Mr Smith and were in fact lime Citrus Spring , his manner changed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #68:5>
It was with some relief that Mary discovered Mr Smith 's mistake but his manner had significantly soured and continued to do so as the afternoon wore on .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #69:5>
Mr Smith 's attitude culminated in his implying that Mary was engaged in &ldquo; cooking the books &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #70:5>
At this juncture he asked Mary for her full name and for that of her superior .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #71:5>
She told him where I was ( in fact next door ) and he promptly left the building .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #72:5>
Mary then came to see me and was at this point in tears over the incident and her treatment by Mr Smith .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #73:5>
Needless to say we are disappointed by this occurrence , not least since it is so inconsistent with our previous amiable dealings with Johnsons .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #74:5>
Your offer of a re-doing of the stocktake is appreciated and on Friday 31st May and I and my predecessor intend to be there for its duration .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #75:5>
Yours Sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #76:5>

Dear Tom
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #79:6>
Thank you for your enquiry about a career in the arts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #80:6>
I think the main qualification I look for when interviewing candidates is experience .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #81:6>
I realise this can be difficult for people starting out in a career , but I think the most important thing you can do is to try and gain as much work experience as possible during your vacations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #82:6>
One good way of doing this would be to try and find employment ( or even voluntary work if you can afford it ! ) on one of the many arts festivals , which go on round the country particularly in the summer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #83:6>
They tend to take on people on a short term basis in a variety of capacities .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #84:6>
I can't think of any other specific advice to offer , except that the more experience you get during vacations , the less you are likely to have to work for nothing for a time when you leave college .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #85:6>
I wish you the very best of luck in your career .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #86:6>

Dear Dan ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #90:7>
Following our meeting yesterday I am writing to confirm the revised charges for student use of the Bloomsbury .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #91:7>
As discussed I am introducing a new band of charges , which will be applicable for performance times , as against rehearsal times .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #92:7>
This is being done to reflect the considerably greater staffing costs incurred by the theatre during performance times .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #93:7>
Events , which will not incur the new charges will include meetings , normal film showings , and jazz lunchtime events .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #94:7>
I have enclosed the new charges on a separate sheet .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #95:7>

<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #103:8>
Sorry about the delay .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #104:8>
Helen mentioned that you thought you shouldn't be charged VAT on the service element of the hire , as you are a charity .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #105:8>
I have checked back over your past events here and you have always been charged .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #106:8>
As far as I know , and this applies to us as well as we are a charity , any VAT which you aren't liable for needs to be claimed back after you have been charged .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #107:8>
We still have to charge it in the first instance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #108:8>
I 'm really glad it was such a good night on the 21st .

<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #116:9>
We had a similar event on in the theatre for the Deputy Manager , who is leaving us shortly and I had hoped to be able to slip away for a few minutes , but unfortunately things turned out to be rather hectic here .

Dear Bob
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #142:12>
As you know , the house lights have now been rewired and as far as I am aware , the contractors have finished work .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #143:12>
Unfortunately , it has come to my notice that three of the fittings in the catwalks and one in the stalls are not working .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #144:12>
I would be grateful if someone could be sent over to investigate this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #145:12>
Mary Brown will be able to explain which fittings are faulty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #146:12>
I would also like to turn to you with another electrical problem we have .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #147:12>
There are three faulty light fittings at the end of the coffee bar in the passage leading to the stairwell at the far end of the CCB .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #148:12>
We were under the impression that they would be replaced when the other coffee bar lights were replaced , but this wasn't the case .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #149:12>
Our technical staff have made several calls to maintenance to ask for the fittings to be repaired and the light bulbs replaced but so far to no avail .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #150:12>
As this is part of an emergency exit , the theatre/college is at present in breach of safety regulations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-021 #151:12>
I apologise if this second issue is not part of your responsibility , but I was at a loss as to whom who I should turn to .

Unfortunately , due to an error when the last release was filed into this encyclopedia , pages 1-396 of the Chronological List of instruments were discarded .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #5:1>
I phoned Butterworths today and was told that , as we are a major client of yours ( and a poor underfunded University Library ) it is likely that you would take pity on us and supply us with these missing pages free of charge .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #6:1>
Is this the case ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #7:1>
We would be very grateful !

Dear Mary ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #13:2>
During the Autumn Term we had a group of American students registered at UCL .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #14:2>
I requested ( from your Customer Service Dept ) and received a batch of individual LEXIS numbers for these students .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #15:2>
These students have now left and a second group will be arriving in January .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #16:2>
I would be grateful if you could : a ) cancel the LEXIS numbers for the students who have now left ( LIST A ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #17:2>
I trust this list is satisfactory - it seemed easier than writing out a very lengthy Cancellation Form !
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #18:2>
b ) arrange for the issue of individual LEXIS numbers for the students coming next year ( LIST B )
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #19:2>
Ideally , I would like to have these numbers ready for the students students ' arrival on January 7th .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #20:2>
I apologise for the very short notice but I have only just received the final list of names myself .

Dear Tom ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #27:3>
A financial adviser from Smith Jones Brown came to see me , and he has recently sent me his advice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #28:3>
I enclose copies of his letter , relevant pages from the NPI brochure , and the Norwich Union plan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #29:3>
If you or your colleague have any comments , I would be glad to have them before I meet the adviser on Friday 22 February .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #30:3>
I should perhaps mention that Smith Jones Brown split the commission 50-50 with me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #31:3>
I also enclose a cheque with your invoice .

You sent me a copy of the tax return for the year ending 5 April 1991 .

Dear Professor Greenbaum ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #55:6>
Following on from our telephone conversation on Friday 15th , I have pleasure in enclosing some brochures on an alternative investment vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #56:6>
The concept of With Profit Bonds is a fairly new one as unlike most investment bonds which are closely linked to stock market movements , the With Profit Bond is a much more stable investment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #57:6>
Once the initial ( usually 5% ) deduction has been made by the Life Assurance company unit values once bought can not go down thus offering security and depending on the investment prowess of the life company bonuses will be added annually to increase the value of your underlying portfolio .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #58:6>
Bonuses once added cannot be taken away ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #59:6>
however , it should be noted that bonuses come from profits yet to be earned and therefore cannot be guaranteed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #60:6>
I would envisage that the With Profits Bond would be held for periods in excess of 5 years to gain the maximum benefit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #61:6>
An income withdrawal of up to 5% per annum can be taken totally tax free even to higher rate tax payers and on maturity there would be only a tax liability for those in the upper tax bands but there is quite a complicated calculation to determine the amount of tax due and the length of time that the bond is held helps to defer this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #62:6>
Norwich Union , General Accident and Sun Life are the primary companies in this market at the moment and currently Norwich Union has the longer track record on excellent With Profit performance albeit their brochure is not as &ldquo; glossy &rdquo; as the other two .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #63:6>
We can discuss the merits of this type of arrangement during our meeting on Friday 22nd .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #64:6>
Kind regards
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #65:6>

We look forward to receiving these shortly if you wish to invest before the end of the tax year .

RE : SCOTTISH AMICABLE INDEPENSION
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #78:8>
Many thanks for your additional investment of &pound-sign;8,000 gross , &pound-sign;6,000 net , and please accept my apologies for not acknowledging this sooner .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #79:8>
The investment is 100% in the With Profit fund which greatly reduces future value volatility as bonus once added cannot be taken away .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #80:8>
Your specified retirement age is 65 , but this can be deferred if you wish , or in fact you may elect to make partial withdrawals .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #81:8>
Funds can be switched by any percentage should you so desire , but I would consider that unlikely .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #82:8>
In order for you to claim additional tax relief I enclose form PP120 , which once completed should be sent to your local Inspector of Taxes. &star;

RE : 1991-92 PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS ( PEP )
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #93:9>
Following your telephone call to me , I have pleasure in enclosing brochures on a selection of two top Unit Trust companies which are on our &lsquo; Best Advice &rsquo; panel Best Advice √≠ panel .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #94:9>
Essentially , the first &pound-sign;3,000 will be via a Unit Trust with the resulting spread of investments , but primarily UK based .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #95:9>
Any additional investment , subject to individual limitations ( see brochures ) will be into a &lsquo; basket &rsquo; of Blue Chip shares .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #96:9>
Do bear in mind that unit values , and their income , can fall as well as rise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #97:9>
Once invested , you have no liability to either Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax , but do consider a PEP as a medium to long-term investment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #98:9>
Ordinarily you will be offered an investment strategy i.e. for Capital Growth or Income .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #99:9>
Both Save &ampersand; Prosper and Fidelity allow you to select the Income plan but have the proceeds reinvested which generally produces a better return than a Growth strategy overall .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #100:9>
Please read my enclosures carefully , and select the most appropriate option and return the papers to me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #101:9>

<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #119:11>
However , since speaking to you I noticed that the postcode stated was incorrect .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #120:11>
As I can only assume that you never received the original copy I have spoken to our Head office who have agreed to send you a cheque for &pound-sign;32 ie. 50% of &pound-sign;320 = &pound-sign;160 - &pound-sign;128 ( already received ) .

Dear Mr Bernard ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #131:12>
Thank you for your letter dated 7th March 1990 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #132:12>
This letter is to confirm that the terms set out within are satisfactory to us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #133:12>
May I take this opportunity to comment on the advertisemsnt for our bungalow which appeared in the London Evening News on Thursday 8th March .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #134:12>
I feel that among the key attributes that need stressing about our bungalow are the fact that it has three bedrooms and a large conservatory , rather than the fact that it has &lsquo; a porch , hall &ampersand; sitting room &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #135:12>
I appreciate that this might have been an oversight as the short description ends with a comma .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #136:12>
If not please could you consider amending it's its content .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #137:12>
I would also like to say something about the photograph that has been used .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #138:12>
I know it is difficult to make our bungalow look attractive especially when the photograph is reduced for the London Evening News or photocopied for handbills ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #139:12>
however I feel the impact our property has on the public may be improved if a more sympathetic photograph was taken say from the rear of the bungalow showing our conservatory .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #140:12>

On the subject of increasing the College 's stock of &lsquo; Human capital &rsquo; , I am considering doing an M.A. in economics during my spare time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #145:13>
The College I have identified as meeting my particular needs is the City of London Polytechnic &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #146:13>
the course consists of four units :
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #147:13>
Theory of Markets
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #148:13>
Theory of Economic Policy
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #149:13>
Econometrics I &ampersand; II
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #150:13>
The cost of the course is at present &pound-sign;370 per unit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #151:13>
Each unit is on a separate night of the week and would involve travelling to London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #152:13>
I would anticipate doing one or two units per year and would be grateful for any financial assistance that the College could give me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #153:13>
I believe that the course would benefit the College in my economics teaching .
<ICE-GB:W1B-022 #154:13>

Dear Professor Greenbaum ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #57:7>
I enclose herewith a revised Schedule of income tax for 1989/90 which has been agreed more or less by the Inspector of Taxes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #58:7>
My original calculations did include &pound-sign;6,000 for business expansion scheme relief but as we did claim the relief against 1990/91 Assessment I have reduced the figure to the &pound-sign;3,000 originally paid .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #59:7>
Hence , the balance that was due on the 1st July 1990 at &pound-sign;760.29 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #60:7>
This is subject to the actual payments having been made on account and I have now asked the Collector for confirmation as to the total taxes paid both on Schedule E and D and we will then confirm as to whether there is any balance outstanding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #61:7>

<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #68:8>
At some time in the near future we will have to decide as to whether to allocate the pension payments to 1991/92 or relate them back to 1990/91 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #69:8>
This will depend on the income for the 2 years and which year will benefit more from the higher rate available .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #70:8>
A decision on this matter must be taken before July 1992 and we should therefore , ensure to prepare next years year 's tax return before that date so that a relevant election can be made .

Dear Sir ,

Re : Prof. S. Greenbaum
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #77:9>
We refer to the demand for the 2nd instalment for 1990/91 , and would be grateful if you would liase liaise with the Inspector of Taxes , as it does now appear that there is a repayment due to our client , in respect of additional reliefs for 1990/91 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #78:9>
We would be grateful if you would refrain from issuing any further demands , until the matter is cleared up .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #79:9>

Dear Sidney ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #82:10>
Further to our recent letter I now have pleasure in enclosing accounts for the year to 5th April 1991 based on the figures that you have supplied .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #83:10>
I have no details of proofreading fees and assume there were none but if further amounts can be estimated , please let me know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #84:10>
It is difficult at this stage to calculate the Schedule D liability for 1991/92 as one has to take into account the PAYE position but assuming all taxes to be paid correctly with all allowances given against your PAYE income , the Schedule D liability would be in the region of &pound-sign;2,000 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #85:10>
However , I do anticipate that not all allowances will be given against PAYE .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #86:10>
I enclose herewith a Schedule showing the income tax liabilities for 1990/91 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #87:10>
Subject to the Inspector 's agreement to the Schedule there should be a repayment due to you of close on &pound-sign;2800 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #88:10>
I have also written to the University of London for confirmation of the miras position on the loan and it is possible that further relief is still due .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #89:10>
Again , I will confirm the position .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #90:10>
There is also the possibility of reducing the National Insurance contributions and I have written to the Department of Social Security for confirmation on this point and will advise you in due course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #91:10>
Meanwhile , if you can agree the figures on the accounts , I would be grateful if you could sign and date one copy where indicated and return to me for submission to the Inspector of Taxes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #92:10>
Meanwhile , I enclose a memorandum in connection with the firm 's charges for your approval .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #93:10>

Dear Sydney Sidney ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #97:11>
I refer to the demand from the Collector for the balance of 1989/90 of &pound-sign;715.93 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #98:11>
We recently submitted a further form for relief for that year but I did mention to the Inspector that if it was convenient for him , he might simply allow the relief against 1990/91 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #99:11>
I think he has opted to do this in which case we might as well pay the figure demanded and I will ensure that the full relief is given in 1990/91 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #100:11>
I therefore return the payslip which should be sent together with the remittance to the Collector as soon as possible .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #101:11>
If you receive any interest on overdue tax demands , please forward them to me as I will then take up the matter with the Inspector .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #102:11>
Meanwhile , I hope to be able to prepare the accounts and establish the exact liability for 1990/91 shortly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #103:11>

Dear Sidney ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #110:12>
I enclose herewith a copy of my letter to the Collector , and will keep you informed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #111:12>
With regard to the Coding for 1991/92 , it all depends on where the major source of income lies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #112:12>
If in fact it is still &lsquo; University College London &rsquo; OT is incorrect , but if it is only a small amount that is being received from that source , then we might as well leave the tax payable at basic rate as on the coding , and we can sort matters out at the end of the year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #113:12>
Perhaps you could confirm the position so that if necessary I can write and ask for an adjustment to the Coding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #114:12>

If you cannot agree will you please telephone this office before sending any further demands .

I enclose the basic letter of appointment which the College is now using for contract researchers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #134:15>
This morning I had a meeting with Mary Brown , the Personnel Officer who deals with academic and related staff , and discussed your position with her .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #135:15>
Although I urged that the College Personnel Department should take a tough line with Heads of Department who fail to abide by agreed College employment practice , I do not believe anything will happen until the next meeting of the AUT/College consultative group .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #136:15>
Professor <unclear-word> is insisting on a meeting with this group to put his point of view .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #137:15>
I am reluctant but have agreed to this providing that the College will be able to implement our agreed model contract irrespective of Prof <unclear-word> 's views .
<ICE-GB:W1B-023 #138:15>
I shall be away from College for the next two weeks but hope that this meeting will take place early next month .

<unclear-word> is aware of the present position so please contact <unclear-word> if there are any developments in the meantime .

Dear Colleague ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #3:1>
To all administrative staff members
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #4:1>
The national Annual Meeting of Administrative Staff Representatives will be held on Tuesday 20th March at SOAS , Malet Street , WC1 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #5:1>
This is an opportunity to raise matters which you would like the national Administrative Staff Committee to pursue , to make nominations for the national Committee ( which meets 3 times a year in London ) , and to meet colleagues from universities and colleges all over the country .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #6:1>
We have organised a meeting for UCL AUT administrative staff ( plus other-related staff who have similar duties ) , to give you an opportunity to elect two representatives for 20th March , and decide on any matters you wish to put to the national meeting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #7:1>
In addition , you may have local issues which you would like to raise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #8:1>
Ideas that come to mind are workload , allocation of the 1% flexibility element from the last salary settlement and the new College admissions procedure .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #9:1>
You are invited to come to the Committee Room , UCL main building , on Wednesday 7th February at 1 pm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #10:1>
If you are unable to attend , please send any comments to the UCL AUT Office before this date .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #11:1>
Finally , the local Committee has discussed how to increase the recruitment of administrative staff into AUT and your ideas would be greatly appreciated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #12:1>
I look forward to seeing you on Friday 7th .

Dear Mr Jones ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #17:2>
Review of Project Grants Scheme
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #18:2>
I understand that for some considerable time , the MRC Stragey Strategy Committee has been considering possible changes to the project grant scheme , to take account of financial pressures and the increasing numbers of high quality applications that cannot be supported .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #19:2>
AUT shares the concern of the MRC at the decline in funding for medical research , and continues to make representations by the most appropriate channels that are available .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #20:2>
However , we have considerable disquiet about one suggestion in particular , that the MRC Strategy Committee has reportedly made .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #21:2>
This is the proposition that an age limit , possibly of 32 years , should be introduced for the personal salary of any scientist holding or employed on a project grant .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #22:2>
AUT members felt so strongly about this particular issue that the following motion was passed nem. con. at the last national AUT Council ( the policy-making body of the AUT ) :
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #X23:2>

<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #24:2>
You are , no doubt , aware of the Smith and Jones cases , in which an age limit of 27 years and of 35 years ( 37 years for clinical staff ) were found to be indirectly discriminatory against women , in the civil service and UGC New Blood Scheme , respectively .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #25:2>
I look forward to hearing your comments and trust that this reported proposal on age limits is not being pursued by the MRC .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #26:2>
Yours sincerely ,

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #29:3>
Last August I wrote to you concerning the position of research staff employed by the former Middlesex Hospital Medical School , on fixed-term external grants .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #30:3>
There is a declining group of individuals who signed a waiver clause denying them their legal rights of claiming unfair dismissal and of redundancy payments .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #31:3>
I urged in my previous letter that these research staff be treated as their present colleagues and be permitted to apply for a redundancy payment when their contracts expire .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #32:3>
I enclose the former letter for information .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #33:3>
During informal conversations with John Brown , I understood that the numbers of staff involved was being investigated in order to estimate the potential cost .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #34:3>
However , I have heard nothing formally .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #35:3>
In the meantime , UCLAUT has put a package of proposals concerning the employment of contract research staff to the College , and this particular matter was referred to once again .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #36:3>
The reason why I am now writing to you , at a time when I know you are extremely busy with matters of more general importance , is that my concern for these lowly-paid staff remains and the matter has not yet been resolved .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #37:3>
My particular efforts are reserved for two AUT members who asked me to raise the matter on their behalf before their employment ceased .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #38:3>
Their interest in this subject continues and I have received recent queries about this issue .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #39:3>
I look forward to hearing the response of the College to this request .

REVISION OF STATUTES
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #46:4>
I received your note of 1st February 1990 , together with the Model Statutes from the University Commissioners .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #47:4>
I had hoped that we would have had an opportunity to discuss these with you before now , as there are several aspects which deserve close attention .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #48:4>
The timescale may not be so long as you suggested , as I believe that the CVCP has requested comments from institutions by May 1st .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #49:4>
In addition , being part of the University of London , comments relating to this federal institution will , no doubt , require an earlier submission date .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #50:4>
I believe that the College has set up a small working group to draw up an initial response to the Model Statute .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #51:4>
I anticipate that there may well be several areas on which the College and AUT would agree , and that the involvement of Joe Bloggs and I me with the discussions taking place within London and nationally could be of assistance in your local deliberations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #52:4>
I do hope , therefore , that it will be possible for us to meet with the College working group as soon as possible .

To all women members of UCLAUT
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #59:5>
The national Annual Women 's Meeting will be held on Friday 12th April , at UCL in the Geography Department , Bedford Way .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #60:5>
We can send two represent<l>atives and additional observers ( who can participate but not vote ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #61:5>
This is an opportunity to make contacts and exchange experiences with women from the rest of the UK university system , to raise matters which you would like the national Women 's Committee to pursue , to make nominations for the national Committee ( which meets 3 times a year in London ) , and to participate in workshops during the afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #62:5>
The discussion topics will be : - parental leave &semi; fixed-term &ampersand; part-time contracts &semi; implementation of sexual harassment codes &semi; and &ldquo; self care &rdquo; for women including stress management .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #63:5>
I have arranged a meeting for UCL AUT women members to give you an opportunity to elect two representatives for 12th April , and decide on any matters you wish to put to the national meeting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #64:5>
In addition , you may have local issues which you would like to raise , such as the work of the College Committee on Equal Opportunity , proposals UCLAUT has put forward on improving conditions for part-time staff , and the present discussions on widening the criteria for promotion .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #65:5>
Please let me know if there are any issues that you would like your local committee to take up .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #66:5>
Finally , London AUT has organised a briefing session on the CVCP Guidelines on Equal Opportunities in Employment in Universities , which have just been issued .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #67:5>
UCL AUT is asked to send two representatives to this session which will be held on 20th March at 2.30 p.m. in Senate House .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #68:5>
To consider all these matters , you are invited to come to the Committee Room , Main Building , south wing , ground floor , on Friday 1st March at 1 pm .

Dear
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #75:6>
I am writing to you personally , on behalf of the University College London branch of the Association of University Teachers , as I understand you are a member of the Council of Queen Mary and Westfield College .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #76:6>
We are , of course , fully aware of the very difficult financial situation facing your College but are extremely concerned to learn that there is a distinct possibility at the forthcoming Council meeting an attempt may be made to declare staff compulsorily redundant , either directly or by giving the Principal delegated powers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #77:6>
At UCL we have faced similar ( if not as great ) financial difficulties .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #78:6>
From the start our College took a conscious decision that it would not resort to compulsory redundancies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #79:6>
This was extremely important in lifting staff morale and for the whole College to continue to resolve our problems in a united manner .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #80:6>
It meant , of course , that for a while the &ldquo; richer &rdquo; Departments bore a heavier burden than some of the &ldquo; poorer &rdquo; Departments , but it is our experience that this has had immense long-term benefits in terms of collegiality , goodwill , morale and keeping a united College .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #81:6>
As a sister College in London University and with numerous academic contacts in every Department , we are very alarmed to learn that QMW may be following a different route which , with our own experience in mind , would be extremely divisive in the short term and very damaging in the long term .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #82:6>
We are aware of other institutions which have attempted to go down this road in recent years but drew back when the disastrous consequences became obvious .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #83:6>
Most fair-minded people would agree that the one institution which did follow this course , the University of City , has been severely damaged academically , and would agree also that this was a very unwise decision .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #84:6>
We urge you as a member of QMW Council not to allow this to happen to your College , but to pursue a similar policy to that of UCL which has led to considerable academic success .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #85:6>
If QMW College does decide to make staff compulsorily redundant , it is only right to let you know that our members will fully support any academic boycott which may be mounted .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #86:6>
We would do this very regretfully as we believe that there are other policies which QMW College could pursue which would avoid compulsory redundancies .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #87:6>

<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #88:6>

Dear Mary ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #91:7>
You are probably very surprised to hear from me after a gap of 19 months , and I hope that this address will reach you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #92:7>
The College position on redundancy payments to grant-funded staff who signed waiver clauses on original appointment at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School , has changed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #93:7>
If you contact Mr John Brown , Director of Personnel , UCL , you should receive the outstanding redundancy payment that you queried when you left the College in 1988-89 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #94:7>
I hope that you now have alternative employment and that , if in a university institution , you have re-joined AUT !
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #95:7>

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #99:8>
For the next two weeks I shall be out of College and , therefore , unable to attend your leaving party .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #100:8>
I did not want to let your departure from College pass , however , without a brief word of appreciation for your sense of fairness and sincerity which has marked your dealings with UCL AUT .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #101:8>
May I wish you a long and happy retirement .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #102:8>
With best wishes ,

19th April 1991
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #105:9>
Dear
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #106:9>
This morning I met the Personnel Officer who deals with academic and research staff , Mary Brown , and asked for an update on your present position .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #107:9>
I understand that you have a copy now of your contract , which confirms you are a permanent member of staff .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #108:9>
Professor Jones has been asked for his views on your promotion to grade II and apparently he supports the proposal but was unsure whether there was sufficient funding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #109:9>
The matter is to be considered when the new budget has been obtained , which should be some time soon .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #110:9>
If there is insufficient money but you are believed to warrant promotion , you may have to wait until Appointments &ampersand; Promotions Committee has agreed a policy on research staff promotions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #111:9>
AUT recently submitted a paper on this and a working party is considering the matter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #112:9>
It was confirmed today that should your Department close ( a hypothetical question at present ) , the College would offer you alternative employment rather than attempting to dismiss you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #113:9>
I will be out of College for the next two weeks , but please contact me after this if you have any queries .
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #114:9>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-024 #115:9>

<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #1:1>
THE QUALITY OF SOCIAL ROLES AS PREDICTORS OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #2:1>
Thank you for sending me this interesting paper &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #3:1>
I have also asked my colleague <unclear-word> to comment as well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #4:1>
It seems to us to be a particularly ponderous and long winded paper , too much of which is taken up with unduly detailed descriptions of variables , step by step explanation of the analytical process , and presentation of insignificant results .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #5:1>
The tables seem also to be too many &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #6:1>
tables 3 , 4 , 5 , for example , could usefully be made into one table .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #7:1>
These problems of expression obscure the findings which , in themselves , make us wish to know more .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #8:1>
For instance why did not the author(s) use this information to compare the relationship of social attributes and health ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #9:1>
Since the results on the quality of social roles seem not to be strongly related to health we would value a comparison in this same study population of the relationship with health of the more conventional social attribute data in order to ask , for example , is marriage/divorce better related to health than quality of marriage , especially since most researchers have only attribute information .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #10:1>
It is almost certain that the author(s) have already undertaken these comparisons , and if so surely they should publish them alongside the current findings .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #11:1>
We also wanted to see more of the basic findings , for example on the relationship of age with assessment of closeness with children , since controlling for age tells us nothing of these findings , which in this instance must vary considerably and importantly with age .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #12:1>
The description of the selection of the study population should also refer to the likelihood that since it is stable geographically it is also likely to be relatively more stable than usual in terms of job and marital changes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #13:1>
And finally one small point &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #14:1>
the comment on page 16 that men have more control over their work should be substantiated with a test for differences in means in the table which presents this finding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #15:1>
We therefore conclude that this is not yet a suitable paper for publication in Social Science and Medicine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #16:1>
As it stands it could be much more clearly and succinctly expressed &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #17:1>
it could also usefully be expanded to tell the reader more about the merits of using quality of social role data as predictors of morbidity and mortality as compared with social attribute data .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #18:1>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #19:2>
<unclear-word> has suggested that it would be useful if I could receive a copy of the plans for the layout of each issue of the Journal at about the same time that he does , so that I can try to make the best fit possible between the papers to be published and the editorial or commentary in each issue .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #20:2>
May I also ask if you would send me deadline dates for when the Journal goes into six issues a year , so that I can be sure to send <unclear-word> copy in time for him to comment and to get it to you by the appropriate date .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #21:2>
With many thanks ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #22:2>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #23:3>
I am writing to confirm that we are happy with the change of title of our proposal to &lsquo; The longterm origins of handicap and disadvantage &rsquo; , and to answer the queries you raised .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #24:3>
The study 's data set is in good shape on the computer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #25:3>
Some &lsquo; cleaning &rsquo; of the data is required , and it will be also necessary to make , on the computer , a number of derived variables , such as those describing job histories .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #26:3>
The work of the computing research assistant is scheduled to begin three months before the social scientist .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #27:3>
During this period the research assistant will work under the direction of the proposers to assemble the necessary variables from the study 's computer archive , to prepare computer files for the analyses , and make the derived variables .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #28:3>
For the remaining nine months the social scientist and research assistant will work together .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #29:3>
This is the period when the social scientist will need to carry out literature searches , make detailed analysis plans and become familiar with the database and the computing skills necessary to use it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #30:3>
The research assistant 's task at this time will be to supply information from the computer for the social scientist during the literature search and analysis planning stage , and teach him/her how best to use the computer , and undertake any examination of case data that the social scientist may require .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #31:3>
I enclose a profile of the study men seen at the last visit , and a paper describing the representativeness of the sample .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #32:3>
The sample is distributed in the same proportion as the population in England , Wales and Scotland , and this is described in the enclosed paper .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #33:3>
I hope that these points answer your questions &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #34:3>
please let me know if there is any more information that you need .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #35:3>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #36:4>
I have suggested two changes to the draft flyer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #37:4>
The first comprises the second sentence in the first paragraph .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #38:4>
I suggest adding this because many people know the study through its previous publications and its originator ( Dr A B C Smith ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #39:4>
people know particularly The Home and the School .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #40:4>
To talk about the work that the current book does in reviewing all the study findings up until middle life I have added that information to the first sentence of the last paragraph .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #41:4>
I also think it is more accurate to expand on the word &lsquo; childhood &rsquo; in this last paragraph by explaining what is contrasted with education and health between the two generations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #42:4>
I hope these will be acceptable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #43:4>
With best wishes ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #44:4>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #45:5>
I cannot see any other errors than the ones you have spotted in the galley proof of the jacket setting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #46:5>
However I have suggested a couple of additions to the paragraphs which will be used in the flyer , and which you also use here &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #47:5>
I enclose a copy of my suggestions for amendment of the flyer and the letter that I have faxed today to Mary Smith .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #48:5>
I appreciate that it may be too late or not desirable to make any change but I just thought I would send you this anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #49:5>
With best wishes ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #50:5>
Yours sincerely
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #51:6>
Thank you for your letter about publicity and about the book jacket .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #52:6>
I am very glad that the photograph will be suitable &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #53:6>
I do not really have any colour preference , but I am sure the great thing is to make it look as near as possible like the original , so that people will recognise it as a beach .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #54:6>
One of my medical colleagues has already decided that it is in fact a picture of the interior of someone 's gut .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #55:6>
With best wishes for Christmas and the New Year .

Dear Colleague ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #60:7>
CAMPAIGN FOR SALARIES , FUNDING AND PAY BARGAINING MACHINERY
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #61:7>
The objective of this ongoing campaign , which was agreed at May Council , is to maximise pressure on the Secretary of State for Education and Science and through him , the Treasury , to obtain additional funding for universities and a working pay machinery , in addition to pressing our present pay claim .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #62:7>
A political campaign enables every member to become involved and it is imperative that large numbers do so .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #63:7>
If this occurs then we can exert influence , especially in this pre-election period .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #64:7>
The enclosed material from AUT HQ outlines what can be done , and includes draft letters that can be used by Departments for graduating students and their parents .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #65:7>
Every member is urged to immediately approach their MP and ask them to sign the Early Day Motion on university funding and the 1991 salary increase .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #66:7>
The number of the motion is 782 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #67:7>
Whilst Early Day Motions are not debated , they are used by MPs to demonstrate concern on key issues and to put pressure on ministers .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #68:7>
the The text of the Early Day Motion is given below :
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #69:7>
When writing to MPs do point out that academic-related staff are also essential to the contribution made by universities and must be included in all future pay settlements .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #70:7>
Can you try to persuade your colleagues both to write and to visit MPs in surgeries .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #71:7>
It is important to approach MPs of all parties , and also parliamentary candidates if you know them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #72:7>
Please send copies of any responses received by you or your colleagues to the AUT Office .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #73:7>
Many thanks for your help .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #74:7>

Dear <unclear-word> ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #78:8>
I enclose a copy of a letter I have sent to all Heads of Department about salary increases for every category of university staff this session .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #79:8>
It is based on what I was told by several HODs , but if it is inaccurate I apologise and would point out that one way to avoid this in future would be for you to inform AUT directly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #80:8>
I hope that we can work together to press the case for increased funding for universities , and for UCL in particular .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #81:8>
In case it has not come to your attention , I enclose some material from AUT Headquarters which is part of our campaign this summer for more funding .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #82:8>
The letter to all individual members and fact sheet should be distributed later this week .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #83:8>
The draft letter to graduating students , and letter to parents and friends has already been sent to our departmental representatives in College .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #84:8>
A letter from the College rather than individual department or union member would have much more weight , so if this has not been planned already , I would like to suggest that graduating students and their families are circulated with something along the lines of the AUT material and/or the substance of what you presented to the Friends of UCL AGM .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #85:8>

Dear Ms Smith ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #89:9>
I am writing to you directly as I am not aware of the name of any local BMA representative amongst the clinical academic staff at the University College &ampersand; Middlesex School of Medicine .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #90:9>
There are two matters which I believe should be brought to your attention , under the spheres of influence agreement between the AUT and BMA .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #91:9>
First , University College London has agreed unilaterally to make no further payment of 1990-91 salary award other than the 5% &ldquo; on account &rdquo; that was paid to all staff last month , unless the accounts would remain in a breakeven position after payment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #92:9>
I enclose the letter from the Director of Personnel , and the circular sent from the Provost to all staff .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #93:9>
I also enclose the letter I sent to all Heads of Department prior to the meeting of College Council at which this decision was taken .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #94:9>
However , on a more positive note , the Personnel Department have confirmed that the 1990 increase in London Allowance for clinical academic staff will be paid this month , backdated to April 1990 .

Dear Sir ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #100:10>
Proposal for Golf Course at Johnstown
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #101:10>
I understand a proposal has been made to develop land around the village of Johnstown as a golf course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #102:10>
As a local resident I wish to protest most strongly that such a development would change the whole character of the village , have a disastrous impact on the small local community , and affect significantly the whole area within a sizeable radius .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #103:10>
The area below Wirral Edge should be preserved for its beauty and be retained for agricultural purposes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #104:10>
It is well known that golf courses , once developed , attract further residential developments .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #105:10>
I understand approval has already been given for a golf course at Smithstown , only three miles from Johnstown .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #106:10>
An extra facility in the area is therefore unnecessary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #107:10>
If a formal application has been made for a golf course , I hope local residents likely to be affected by the development will be given every opportunity to present their objections at a formal inquiry .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #108:10>
I shall be grateful for your assurance that no approval has yet been given for the proposal and that residents in the area will be kept informed of what the Council is likely to agree to .
<ICE-GB:W1B-025 #109:10>

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #3:1>
Thank you very much for inviting me to a fascinating , informative and very enjoyable visit to see the work of the United Newspapers Group last Wednesday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #4:1>
I was particularly impressed by the friendliness of everyone and by the breadth of the organisation and opportunities for management careers within the Group .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #5:1>
I was particularly pleased to be able to sit next to two of our London graduates , Deirdre Hosein from Bedford College and John Lewis from Westfield College , during dinner in the Board dining room and look forward to seeing them at the United Newspapers presentation at our central office , 50 Gordon Square on 2nd May .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #6:1>
We have displayed your posters in our college careers offices and hope that we can attract some good London students to the event .

<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #14:2>
It was good to meet you and other members of staff , including several with UCL connections .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #15:2>
I was particularly impressed by the excellent level of contact and supervision between your trainee solicitors and partners or senior legal assistants , and also by the facilities provided by the firm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #16:2>
You are also very well placed for London 's newest tube station , at St. Pauls Paul 's Thames Link , which I was pleased to discover as a result of my visit !

Brochure Launch -

17 August 1990
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #25:3>
Thank you very much for inviting me to the launch of the new &ldquo; Guinness World of Graduates &rdquo; brochure , last Friday , which was highly informative and very enjoyable .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #26:3>
It was good to have the opportunity to learn more about your successful graduate scheme and to meet you and others involved in selection and training at Guinness , together with an impressive selection of recent graduates .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #27:3>
The new brochure is a big improvement , which together with the new video , should illustrate the many attractions of the scheme to finalists .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #28:3>
The range of training courses available to newly joined graduates is particularly impressive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #29:3>
Following my recent telephone conversation with Anne Smith , I am enclosing the University of London Careers Advisory Service information card , containing details of college careers offices and an indication of those with video facilities available for showing employer videos to students , on demand .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #30:3>
Many of our colleges are larger than most universities and should receive their own local supply of brochures and videos .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #31:3>
We have over 8000 students here at UCL for example .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #32:3>
Thank you also for a very enjoyable buffet lunch and also for the attractive bag of Guinness brochures and products , including the famous Book of Records .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #33:3>
May I take this opportunity to wish you all the best for your MBA Course at INSEAD , next year .

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #45:5>
I very much enjoyed my day with you , both at the Institute of Chartered Accountants and subsequently as a guest of your firm at the Bloomsbury Crest Hotel and the Wine Cellar of the Cafe Royal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #46:5>
The whole day went very well and it was good to hear about all the important and welcome changes in the exam structure and other matters such as T.O.PP. and then to move on to meet Tom Brown and other partners in Brown Jones and to hear their views about the changing profession in a very enjoyable and relaxed setting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #47:5>
I think that all the careers advisers at your visit agreed that larger medium sized firms have so much to offer and we wish that our students could be more aware of these aspects .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #48:5>
Perhaps you should get a &ldquo; tame &rdquo; psychologist to devise a short questionnaire to help prospective students to match themselves to their ideal type of accountancy firm , which doubtless would show that many of their needs could be satisfied by a medium sized firm !
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #49:5>
Such a questionnaire , sponsored by Brown Jones , could be made available through careers services .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #50:5>
I hope that the visit for your offices , on 20th , went well .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #51:5>
It was a pity that pressure of work , here , prevented me from attending .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #52:5>

<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #62:7>
Thank you very much for inviting me to a very enjoyable and informative &ldquo; office warming &rdquo; and lunch at your new offices in Vine Street .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #63:7>
It was good to be able to meet Tom Brown and Joe Bloggs as well as friends from some other careers services and to be able to discuss matters of mutual interest in legal recruitment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #64:7>
It was good to hear that Tom has soom some close contacts in our department of Laws .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #65:7>
Have you considered attending the UCL Careers Fair , held normally at the end of October each year , and the University of London 's Law Fair on 14th-15th March ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #66:7>
Many leading firms , both large and medium sized will be there on the look-out for high quality students .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #67:7>
With kind regards .

Dear John ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #72:8>
Thank you very much for inviting me to the Careers Pack Workshop on the 11th .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #73:8>
It was good to see you again and to be able to meet Mary and Anne .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #74:8>
I feel that we had a very fruitful session and I very much enjoyed the buffet lunch afterwards .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #75:8>
It was good to be able to discuss our mutual interest r in the Isle of Man .

<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #82:9>
Thank you very much for inviting me to the final stage of the Competition and excellent buffet lunch , at the Royal Automobile Club , on Wednesday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #83:9>
It was fascinating to see the wide range of products to be made by the finalists , and exciting to await the decision of the judges .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #84:9>
I understand that consideration is being given to excluding entries in future years from institutions , such as Eaton Hall , where the production of innovatory ideas is part of the course , as this would seem fairer to students innovating products in their spare time .

I have not written to you before because I was waiting to see if the join to my carpet would develop any further faults .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #95:11>
Although it has not , I know that you are uncertain about future deterioration and agree that the work is not of an acceptable standard .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #96:11>
I realise that this is the best that can be achieved with a carpet that is not woven , as we had previously .
<ICE-GB:W1B-026 #97:11>
Would you please let me know what you suggest as being the fairest manner to deal with the situation as I do not wish to be faced with the necessity to deal with the problem when further deterioration occurs .

CRIMINAL JUSTICE CONFERENCES
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #3:1>
While we were in Strasbourg recently , you mentioned to me the invitation you had received to speak at one of the series of Criminal Justice Conferences being arranged in England .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #4:1>
The aim of these conferences is to bring together people working in different sectors of the criminal justice system , with a view to generating ideas for improving the operation of the system , and enhancing the quality of leadership within it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #5:1>
The topics covered have not been confined to management issues , but have extended , for example , to the fairness of the system from the standpoint of victims , offenders and those who work in the criminal justice services .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #6:1>
Those taking part are drawn from the judiciary , the Crown prosecution service , the police , and the prison and probation services .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #7:1>
The first four conferences , held between September 1989 and March 1990 , is are thought to have been highly successful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #8:1>
I have asked John Smith whether you would be expected to speak about the situation in England and Wales from an international perspective , or about how the Netherlands and other countries in Europe deal with the problems faced by all our systems of criminal justice .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #9:1>
John wanted to give this some thought , and said that he or Mary Brown would telephone you about it .

Dear Sir
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #18:3>
We have in our front garden a Norwegian Spruce , about thirty years old and rising well above the height of our own and other surrounding houses .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #19:3>
In the recent strong winds , this tree has been blowing about with great vigour , and we are greatly concerned that it may blow down , causing damage to our own or our neighbour 's property .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #20:3>
In view of this risk , we think that it would be only prudent to have the tree cut down , and I should be glad to know whether we may have the Council 's consent to that being done .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #21:3>
The tree is not thriving :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #22:3>
despite continued mulching with fertilizer , it remains bare on its lower branches .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #23:3>
Your staff are welcome to inspect it .

Dear Sir
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #27:4>
UNITARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #28:4>
As residents in the Borough , we would like to put forward , for consideration by the Council , comments on some of the proposals contained in its draft Unitary Development Plan .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #29:4>
Policy 12H - Church lane Playing Fields :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #30:4>
The proposal to designate this open space as available for housing seems to us to conflict with a number of the general policies set out in the draft Plan : -
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #X31:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #X32:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #X33:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #X34:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #X35:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #36:4>
These general policies apply with added force in relation to a relatively small open space situated in a conservation area and bounded by an ancient listed wall .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #37:4>
On these grounds we strongly object to the proposed development .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #38:4>
We consider that the Council ought to give priority to redeveloping derelict land rather than green-field open spaces .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #39:4>
Policy 13M - the Victoria Road Link
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #40:4>
Policy 14M - the Church Road Link :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #41:4>
It is not clear that enough thought has been given to the consequences of these proposals for the movement of traffic outside the areas immediately affected , and particularly in the direction of the A3 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #42:4>
It would not be sensible to make localized road improvements that would encourage more traffic which would then clog up unsuitable roads in residential areas elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #43:4>
Policy 30M - &ldquo; Kingston Road improvements :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #44:4>
The nature of the proposed improvements is not made sufficiently clear .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #45:4>
This policy should be redefined in terms that rule out any revival of the plans for a Relief Road which the Council has , since last year 's Borough elections , decisively and rightly rejected .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #46:4>
Policy M11 - Categorization of roads :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #47:4>
We would ask for Mostyn Road to be categorized as a local access road rather than as a distributor road .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #48:4>
It is a relatively narrow road fronted entirely by houses or open spaces .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #49:4>
Its use by any significant volume of through traffic is liable to cause congestion and danger ( not least to schoolchildren crossing on their way to Merton Park First School ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #50:4>
At its northern end the road narrows to a width of six metres , as against the minimum width of 7.3 metres for a distributor road .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #51:4>
It could not be widened without destroying the trees which line it and are subject to tree preservation orders , and so altering its character and appearance in a way incompatible with the law relating to conservation areas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #52:4>
Policy M20 - Traffic calming measures :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #53:4>
The application of such measures ought to depend on the circumstances of any particular road , and not simply on its categorization .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #54:4>
Mostyn Road , for example , tempts drivers to go at excessive speeds because it is long and straight &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #55:4>
such speeds are all the more dangerous because the road is narrow .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #56:4>
For these reasons there would be a strong case on merits for applying traffic calming measures to Mostyn Road however it were categorized .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #57:4>
Yours faithfully

To the Editor RIPA Report
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #61:5>
Dear Sir
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #62:5>
&lsquo; A BETTER DEAL FOR STAFF &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #63:5>
I am surprised that the judges in the competition for the RIPA-HAY Prize should have awarded even a commendation to the Brighton Health Authority for an initiative which includes , as one of its main features , &rdquo; priority out-patient appointments and priority treatment , if needed &ldquo; for the Authority 's staff ( RIPA Report , Autumn 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #64:5>
This may be innovative , but it also appears quite contrary to the principle that priority for attention and treatment under the NHS should be determined solely according to a patient 's medical needs .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #65:5>
It seems wrong to me ( a retired civil servant ) that people employed within any public service should , as its customers , be granted exemption from the limitations and delays that other customers have to put up with .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #66:5>
One can understand the Health Authority 's motives , but a panel of independent judges should have been able to take a more detached view , recognising that good management has an ethical as well as a practical dimension , and that an end ( however excellent ) does not justify every conceivable means ( however &rdquo; inexpensive &ldquo; ) .

SUBSIDENCE
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #73:6>
In the north-facing wall of this house there has been for some years a narrow crack which appeared not to be developing further .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #74:6>
In May this year , however , we noticed that the crack appeared to be lengthening , and to some extent could be felt on the inside of the wall .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #75:6>
We sought the advice of Smith Jones Ltd , structural engineers , who after an inspection recommend underpinning of part of the house , and offer to carry out this work .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #76:6>
I enclose copies of the documents which they have sent me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #77:6>
As our buildings insurance covers damage resulting from subsidence , I should be grateful if you would consider these documents , and let me know whether you are prepared to meet the cost of the proposed work ( apart from the first &pound-sign;500 ) under the policy , or whether you wish any further investigation to be carried out .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #78:6>

Re 21 HIGH ROAD W2E19
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #84:7>
Thank you for your letter of 31 July .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #85:7>
I referred this , with the accompanying report and other documents , to our insurers ( Sun Alliance ) who arranged for the property to be inspected by loss adjusters .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #86:7>
I now have authority to put in hand the following investigative measures :
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #87:7>
( 1 ) excavation of a trial hole against the side wall of the house ( where the crack appears ) to determine the type and depth of the foundations and the composition and condition of the subsoil &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #88:7>
( 2 ) a water test of the drains to show whether they are leaking &semi; (
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #89:7>
3 ) fixing tell-tales to the crack in the side wall , in order to show whether the movement is progressive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #90:7>
I should be grateful if Smiths would carry out these investigations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #91:7>
( This of course implies no commitment , on the part of myself or the insurers , to your undertaking the other work which you have recommended . ) / We shall - 2 -
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #92:7>
We shall be away on holiday for a fortnight from Wednesday 29 August .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #93:7>
Perhaps you would get in touch with us on or after 12 September about undertaking the investigations .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #94:7>
We would need some notice , in order to clear the lean-to annex which adjoins the side wall , and to arrange for someone from the loss adjusters to inspect the trial hole immediately after it is excavated .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #95:7>

We wish to accept the estimate , set out in your letter to my wife of 24 March , for external decoration and miscellaneous work to be carried out at this address at a total price ( including VAT ) of &pound-sign;3013 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #109:9>

Dear Sirs

I am sending you herewith a cheque in payment for the equipment listed on the enclosed invoice and delivered to this address on 5 January .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #116:10>
The invoice shows no deposit as having been paid &semi; but in fact I paid a deposit of &pound-sign;903.87 to Mr Swan on 11 December in the form of a cheque which has since been cleared through my bank .
<ICE-GB:W1B-027 #117:10>
The cheque which I am now sending you is therefore made out for the balance of &pound-sign;4293.38 .

<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #27:3>
Dear Colin ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #28:3>
I am pleased to be able to write to you with final confirmation that we wish you to start regular cleaning of our buildings , as per your schedule dated 5 March 1991 , on the 22 July 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #29:3>
It would be advantageous if the initial clean could occur the previous weekend 20/21 July .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #30:3>
We will be giving our existing cleaners notice on the 21 June and ask them to work out their notice until 20 July .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #31:3>
When you start we will already be in the students ' summer vacation , but for your reference next years year 's term dates are : 30 Sept. ' 91 to 13 Dec. ' 91 13 Jan ' 92 to 27 March ' 92 27 April ' 92 to 26 June ' 92
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #32:3>
Additionally the building will be completely closed for approximately one week during the religious holiday periods .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #33:3>
I will inform you of the exact dates of these closures as soon as I know them .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #34:3>
During this time access may be prearranged in the same way as it is on Sundays , namely that the cleaners report to the College front lodge who will then allow all the cleaners into the building in one trip .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #35:3>
In the event of an emergency when cleaners are on the premises assistance may be obtained by dialling 222 on any college internal phone .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #36:3>
Less urgent calls should be made by dialling 3333 whilst my internal extension number is 2604 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #37:3>
I will place a first aid kit in the second floor cleaners ' cupboard of the 25 Gordon Street building , prior to the start of your contract , for use by your cleaners .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #38:3>
I would greatly appreciate it if you could sent send me COSHH risk assessments and data on all chemical based cleaning products you will be using on site .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #39:3>
See you soon ,

Dear Ron ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #44:4>
As you may recall I recently enquired about your proposed prices for next years year 's cleaning of our buildings and as you will recall I told you that I was required to seek other tenders .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #45:4>
These tenders were submitted to the Union 's Services Committee which resolved that given the current financial climate we had no option but to take the cheapest quote .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #46:4>
I regret to now inform you that we will be terminating all our contracts with you as of Monday 22nd of July 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #47:4>
This is due neither to the quality of your staff nor of the work they perform .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #48:4>
I hope you will be able to relocate these staff satisfactorily .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #49:4>
In the future we will be tendering for our cleaning annually and I will invite you to tender nearer the date .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #50:4>
The new contractors will be starting the week of the 22nd .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #51:4>

<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #66:6>
I am very sorry that the room was not up to the standard that we both require .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #67:6>
I have enquired with our contract cleaners who have told me that it was due to staff illness .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #68:6>
We have recently dismissed these contractors who are currently working out their notice -
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #69:6>
the quality of cleaning since then has not been too wonderful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #70:6>
I would like to once more apologise , and assure you that in future you will be greeted by facilities of a much higher standard .

<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #74:7>
27 March 1991
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #75:7>
Dear Mr Cooves ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #76:7>
The record of events of the night of Thursday March 21 given below are based on the notes I took and logged in my day book on that day .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #77:7>
As we came to empty the building at the end of what had been a busy night I arranged for my stewards and I me to guard the fire alarm break glass panels on the stairwell .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #78:7>
I took the first floor as this is the most often frequent cause of false alarms .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #79:7>
This was an attempt to avoid the false triggering of the alarm , as had occurred the previous Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #80:7>
At 11:25 , when the building was virtually empty , I was breaking up a small , friendly , brawl on the first floor landing when an aisian Asian man walking past triggered the alarm before I could stop him and then , despite my attempt to apprehend him , left the building through the ground floor fire exit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #81:7>
I left him and worked back upstairs informing the staff that it was a definite hoax but to finish evacuation as normal and to then leave the building and control the crowd outside and await the Fire Brigade .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #82:7>
I told Lee Pessall , who had just spoken to communications .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #83:7>
And we completed the evacuation ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #84:7>
this was rapid as there had been very few people left in the building at this time .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #85:7>
When the building was clear I met Lee again ( now on the ground floor ) ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #86:7>
he assured me that the Brigade had be been cancelled following our conversation , and when five minutes later they had not arrived ( at least ten minutes after the alarms started ) and I 'd spoken to communications and checked that the brigade wasn't coming I first silenced the alarm , then replaced the break glass panel with one from my stock , and finally reset the alarm panel .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #87:7>
I hope that this account of events meets with your requirements .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #88:7>
My only comments on the situation would be that whilst the man in communications had not followed procedure he had acted in a sensible and responsible fashion , and that I would not treat him too harshly .

Dear Mr Malik ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #93:8>
It has come to my attention that the Union does not have a current complete set of keys to the film society area .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #94:8>
For both safety and security purposes I require that a list of all locks and keyholders , together with a full set of keys be supplied to the union .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #95:8>
This is to enable emergency access without any undue damage and to ensure that the security of the college rectangle is not compromised .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #96:8>
It will also meet the requirements of our insurers , who insist on all reasonable steps to be taken to ensure security .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #97:8>
It will further enable me to gain access to complete safety and fire inspections , together with any necessary maintenance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #98:8>
I appreciate your time and prompt attention in this matter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #99:8>
If these steps are not taken by the end of the month I will , reluctantly , have to consider changing the locks .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #100:8>
Yours sincerely ,

Dear Mrs. Mitchell ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #106:9>
You recently sent us a letter informing us of unacceptable performance of our Telecom Security intruder alarm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #107:9>
I have spoken with Telecom who have sent my colleague , the Finance &ampersand; Administration Manager , a letter ( enclosed ) describing what they feel are their reasons for the problems .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #108:9>
The alarm system does contain two panic alarm devices .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #109:9>
These are located in reception ( our street entrance ) and the cashier 's office ( 4th floor ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #110:9>
I hope this will allay your worries over the system and prevent any problems with withdrawal of police cover .

Dear Mr ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #116:10>
I would like to object to the plan to site a mini skip business at the rear of Smith Industial Site , Old Town Road , London .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #117:10>
I feel that this area has already had too much development for the narrow industrial roads that serve it .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #118:10>
We suffer a lot in Town Road from the volume of traffic some of which has little concern for residents in the area &semi;
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #119:10>
this has resulted in the Council putting speed humps along our road , which has had some success .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #120:10>
However , some larger vehicles speed over them and I wonder what noise empty skip lorries would make if they did likewise .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #121:10>
Clearly if this area is to be allowed to develop further then some alternative access needs to be provided .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #122:10>
Yours sincerely

<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #134:12>
I am writing to make a claim under our House and Home Insurance Policy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #135:12>
Some time on the weekend of the 29/30th April my car was broken into and two videos and a pair of shoes stolen .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #136:12>
The value of the videos can be ascertained from Smith 's Video Tape Centre , High Road , London , ( telephone 123456 ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #137:12>
I have informed Smiths of the theft and my membership number is 1234ABC .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #138:12>
I estimate the value of the shoes to be &pound-sign;40 ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #139:12>
they were men 's leather soled shoes which were approximately six months old .
<ICE-GB:W1B-028 #140:12>
The car was locked and I have informed the police of the theft .

SURVEY OF CURRENT PRACTICES
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #8:1>
Thank you for your belated help with my survey task .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #9:1>
I was amazed at the volume of information which was provided by respondents and I 'm sure you will appreciate my problem in attempting to summarise it !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #10:1>
I feel the most effective means of communicating the key results to respondents is to now enclose a survey summary which pinpoints what UCLi considered to be good practices from where we find ourselves at present .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #11:1>
Other universities will no doubt start from a different base line but I hope the summary enables you to locate relevant information sources for your particular situation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #12:1>
Upon reading the enclosed , should you wish to follow-up follow up any good practices , it would be necessary for you to directly contact the university concerned and seek their assistance by way of copy documents .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #13:1>
I am afraid I do not have the resources to copy everything to respondents and hope you will understand .

CASE AWARDS
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #23:2>
Your letter to Mary of 20th May has come to me as the new MD at UCLi -
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #24:2>
you may have heard that Mary decided not to return from maternity leave full time , but will be doing part-time assignments with UCLi , and I have recently accepted the MD post .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #25:2>
I 'll ask my Contracts colleagues in UCLi to top up this reply where necessary , but I hope the following assurances ease your understandable concerns .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #26:2>
I 'll be happy to come and meet you if you have any residual concerns .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #27:2>
In any case , I 'd like to meet you to cover rather wider ground and see how UCLi might support you and your colleagues in more proactive ways .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #28:2>
Regarding CASE awards :
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #29:2>
( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #30:2>
UCLi traditionally has not been involved , except where requested to advise on particular issues , such as a company fielding unusual or unfair contract terms .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #31:2>
The request usually comes from the academic involved , or sometimes from Research Grants section where they sense contract terms are not right .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #32:2>
( 2 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #33:2>
CASE awards are &ldquo; industrial contracts &rdquo; ( as well as being SERC awards ) -
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #34:2>
we can't really escape this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #35:2>
However , usually ( and ideally ! ) the industrial contract is of a thoroughly standard kind .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #36:2>
However , as a contract , College now insists that we are in the loop for obtaining College signature and so that UCLi log the income to meet our reporting obligations to College .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #37:2>
( 3 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #38:2>
There are &ldquo; good &rdquo; and &ldquo; bad &rdquo; model CASE agreements around and the University world as a whole is pretty united on which companies are &ldquo; unfairest &rdquo; ( eg <unclear-word> ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #39:2>
( 4 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #40:2>
UCLi has no need to &ldquo; vet &rdquo; agreements for recovery of indirect costs because they are not a College requirement on us , although we do have useful precedents for securing rather better &ldquo; benefits &rdquo; than the bare minimum stated under CASE rules ( for example , an <unclear-word> award + 20% IC + bench fee , total + 80% ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #41:2>
( 5 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #42:2>
We do have concerns - and believe staff should too - on the more extreme agreements which sometimes get drafted by companies who are relatively unfamiliar with CASE contract norms .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #43:2>
Thus sometimes there are very bad restrictions on publications or a poor balance of benefits on the question of ipr and its exploitation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #44:2>
However , WHEREVER POSSIBLE NOW we believe negotiation of improved terms ( a ) should only be considered if there seems time to negotiate them and/or if the staff member insists anyway , ( b ) should ideally be negotiated &ldquo; off-line &rdquo; from particular cases , which therefore do not get held up , as in the ICI case above .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #45:2>
In return , we would like staff to support us in our off-line attempt to negotiate new standard terms with the company concerned , for the benefit of any future CASE awards from that source .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #46:2>
( 6 )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #47:2>
I believe 5 ( a ) and ( b ) should meet your concerns about the &ldquo; time window &rdquo; for locating students and securing their commitment , which I fully appreciate .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #48:2>
Of course , where a draft contract is fielded to you very early on in the sequence and you have concerns about its fairness , do let us know .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #49:2>
We can either support you with &ldquo; fairer &rdquo; model agreements and &ldquo; standard arguments &rdquo; for you to carry out the negotiation , or we can negotiate for you .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #50:2>
There is choice -
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #51:2>
we aim to facilitate not get in the way or empire build !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #52:2>
Thank you for being open about your concerns -
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #53:2>
it helps us to make sure our research support services meet both College objectives and departmental ones .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #54:2>
I look forward to meeting you soon .

Dear colleague
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #62:3>
FACILITY AND FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTS
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #63:3>
Many thanks for the sample generic agreements you sent me .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #64:3>
Your assumption that College policy is showing through certain clauses is correct , with perhaps the caveat that not always has that policy been carefully thought through !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #65:3>
Occasionally , it might be a &ldquo; rushed &rdquo; precedent which could bear some further examination and adaptation where necessary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #66:3>
Having said that , I am very much in favour of the idea that clients see the best models available as early on as possible and get into negotiations where the model doesn't quite fit .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #67:3>
Any changes to College policy heralded by such cases is best sorted out off-line for the benefit of future cases without holding up progress on current cases .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #68:3>
The generic agreements you sent are a mixture of &ldquo; tech transfer &rdquo; provisions and &ldquo; college services/consultancy &rdquo; contracts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #69:3>
The former is less prone to standard terms than the latter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #70:3>
I have therefore asked two colleagues to be your source of advice and points of contact for processing new drafts through the system .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #71:3>
They would work on cases as a team so either/or can be your initial contact .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #72:3>
They will each know when to involve the other in responding to the task in hand .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #73:3>
Thus you can always contact <unclear-word> ( Ext 1234 ) of Technology Transfer or <unclear-word> ( ext 4321 ) of Contracts Group .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #74:3>
Meanwhile , I 've asked <unclear-word> and <unclear-word> to look at the generic papers and to advise on any problem areas .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #75:3>
I should be able to come back to you within 2 weeks but please tell me if this doesn't fit your own deadline .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #76:3>

Dear
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #85:4>
EEC AUDIT
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #86:4>
I thought it might help to ease your obvious concerns about the audit and its outcome if I mentioned my experiences from a similar event in 1986 when I was at University .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #87:4>
( By the way , all seems to have gone quiet since the Auditors visited UCL before Xmas but we believe this is primarily because one of the pair has left to work for another firm .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #88:4>
This has caused a hiccough in the original plan , but they will be back fairly soon ! )
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #89:4>
At University , we faced closely similar problems , such as no system for booking out the hours which different staff worked on projects , booking of equipment usage , charging an apparently high overhead , etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #90:4>
However , knowing the end result for University I think I can give certain reassurances at this stage of the game .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #91:4>
For example , it became clear that the auditors had to do what they had to do , and to report as they found , but we saw their draft report and had ample chance to correct certain misconceptions , errors of fact or interpretation , etc .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #92:4>
We also saw what they were recommending and , although we couldn't influence very much what they wrote , it allowed us to prepare for whatever response CEC actioned .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #93:4>
After a few reasonable exchanges with CEC all was settled amicably .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #94:4>
Basically University took the stance that whatever the auditors might be recommending from their knowledge of normal industrial practices , there was no question of altering our accounting and administrative procedures in any wholesale way just to suit a few EEC contracts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #95:4>
This applied particularly to formal booking of staff hours to projects .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #96:4>
We did agree to arrange a ( new ) monthly &ldquo; chitty &rdquo; signed off by the project leader and lodged with contracts section that the named personnel had devoted x/y/z/ hours to the project .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #97:4>
It was interesting to note that in the event the sum total of hours from chitties always turned out more than contracted for !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #98:4>
Although we couldn't charge for the extra hours , it at least showed what a bargain CEC was getting and how hard people actually worked &ldquo; !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #99:4>
No-one in University found the chitty system too burdensome and it kept auditors happy .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #100:4>
Another example relates to overhead .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #101:4>
In those days , University claimed +100% on the labour cost in 50% shared cost contracts , a high figure in its day , which is why they were auditing us !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #102:4>
In their report , the auditors said they thought the real overhead was +118% , which stopped CEC worrying thereafter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #103:4>
Of course , times have moved on since then .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #104:4>
In the UCL context of even higher overheads , the present auditors do not seem too concerned about the level as such , more that we billed on a set of labour rates fixed for the term of the contract , ie not necessarily reflecting actual UCL overhead costs in a given year .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #105:4>
I honestly believe we have the defence of John 's letter of 23rd February , 1988 telling us to do just that .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #106:4>
Thus , what the auditors are now trying to work out from actual published account figures is who 's on the winning end of all this -
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #107:4>
us or CEC ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #108:4>
If we are , and CEC wants a refund , we should vehemently resist , quoting <unclear-word> 's letter .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #109:4>
If , however , the auditor 's report shows that the basic overhead calculation is flawed ( we have no such suggestion at present ) then we may indeed have a problem , although again lead-up correspondence with <unclear-word> indicates CEC had a basic happiness with our figures .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #110:4>
I would resist refund but we may have to agree a new overhead rate on future contracts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #111:4>
The audit process is mainly to ferret out the occasional &rdquo; fraudulent &ldquo; organisation (
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #112:4>
there have been some industrial companies caught out I understand ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #113:4>
In all other cases , they seek to set new agreed procedures and/or figures for the future , where necessary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #114:4>
Apologies for the length of this note !
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #115:4>
To sum up , I see no reason yet to be too concerned .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #116:4>
We should simply continue to do our best to provide the information they seek and await sight of their report .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #117:4>
I hope this helps .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #118:4>

Thank you for your letter of January 15th regarding the Half-tone Image invention .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #126:5>
I am writing simply to confirm with you ( and , by copy of this letter , with all the other parties involved ) that it has been agreed between the inventors and the College 's exploitation staff that all ongoing work on <unclear-word> and ideas as to their possible application shall be treated as a team effort .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #127:5>
Clearly in each case the inventor will need to be correctly identified in accordance with patent law , but all relevant patents should be filed citing <unclear-word> and <unclear-word> as joint applicants .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #128:5>
All accounts in respect of charges for work on <unclear-word> patenting will be met by <unclear-word> and should be sent to me for action in the first instance .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #129:5>
By the same token , please take all instructions in this matter from UCLi Ltd .
<ICE-GB:W1B-029 #130:5>
In addition , as I confirmed to you by telephone last week , we would like you to &rdquo; read yourself into the subject &ldquo; more fully , as outlined in my memorandum to <unclear-word> dated 27th November 1990 .

Further to Wednesday 's meeting I have pleasure in enclosing a revision of the proposed option agreement , incorporating the various changes we agreed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #6:1>
I hope you will find it satisfactory .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #7:1>
It needs looking at fairly closely , since I have made a number of minor revisions in the interests of clarity -
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #8:1>
I do not think I have changed the meaning at all , but perhaps it would be as well for <unclear-word> to cast a final eye over it anyway .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #9:1>
To signify your acceptance you are invited to sign and return both copies , together with your cheque for the option fee .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #10:1>
This time I really do enclose a supporting invoice for <unclear-word> and look forward to your early favourable reply .

I am writing to enquire whether you might be interested in an invention developed in University College London 's <unclear-word> in collaboration with the <unclear-word> ( <unclear-word> )
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #20:2>
This relates to use of fragments or sequences of plasma fibronectin with specific tissue binding properties .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #21:2>
Conjugation of drugs , enzymes , growth factors , etc. to these polypeptides provides a method for targeting such agents to particular sites of tissue injury .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #22:2>
These conjugates are well suited to identifying sites of connective tissue injury and blood clot formation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #23:2>
Work so far has concentrated on applications in thrombosis and rheumatology .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #24:2>
There are clear possibilities , however , for conjugates such as these in the localisation of combinations of agents to promote effective wound healing .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #25:2>
An international patent application assigned to <unclear-word> has been filed describing the principle and main applications .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #26:2>
Further development work is currently on-going within the College .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #27:2>
Meanwhile , the <unclear-word> with <unclear-word> 's agreement , are seeking collaborators in the wound healing field who may be interested in developing the system with a view to specific markets or utilising the current technology .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #28:2>
We envisage that such a collaborator may wish to support research into a single defined application .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #29:2>
Alternatively , you might be interested in collaborating through a CASE award research studentship or even exploring the possibilities of obtaining LINK funding from the <unclear-word> .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #30:2>
For background information I am enclosing a summary which describes some aspects of the invention .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #31:2>
If you feel interested in exploring this opportunity further , it may be necessary to operate under a confidentiality agreement since many aspects of the invention have not yet been published for reasons of commercial confidentiality .

<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #42:3>
Your letter to <unclear-word> regarding the above has now been passed on to me , as the Head of Technology Transfer .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #43:3>
Firstly I would like to thank you for sending me your description of the invention which was very helpful .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #44:3>
My response is as follows :
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #45:3>
1.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #46:3>
I believe we should have this assessed for patenting by our patent agents and I propose to send your description to them and request that they respond to you directly .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #47:3>
2.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #48:3>
I would like to emphasise the need for confidentiality and to request that no public disclosure takes place before we have completed the assessment .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #49:3>
In relation to this I would like to know what discussions have taken place with <unclear-word> and ask you to consider my previous statement on any future contacts .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #50:3>
We can supply a simple confidential disclosure agreement where necessary .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #51:3>
3.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #52:3>
Have there been any previous publications/presentations ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #53:3>
4.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #54:3>
Can the technique be applied more broadly to biomass analysis in addition to fungal mycelia ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #55:3>
Is it possibly applicable as a general image analysis technique ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #56:3>
5.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #57:3>
Are you aware of any competing techniques , groups or products already available ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #58:3>
6.
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #59:3>
Can you consider defining inventions as opposed to &lsquo; contributors &rsquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #60:3>
You may find the above questions obvious , for which I apologise , but I feel they are sufficiently critical to be worth emphasising .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #61:3>
I look forward to hearing from you in early January .

Dear Sir ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #107:6>
<unclear-word>
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #108:6>
<unclear-word> would very much like to attend a further combined course in Advanced Navigation and GPS Navigation following completion of the foundation course he is currently attending at University College London ( Certificate in Air Survey Photography ) .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #109:6>
We understand from air survey experts that this advanced course is a necessary and desirable addition to his air survey training because the present course provides only a foundation training in navigation systems .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #110:6>
Advanced training in navigation systems is essential as most of the aircraft used in air survey work are modern aircraft and pilots are trained with an instrument rating .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #111:6>
The navigators must therefore understand the same navigation instrumentation that their pilot uses because the navigator is in charge of the mission .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #112:6>
He therefore must understand NAV/COM , DME/VOR , R/NAV , Doppler , LORAN-C and Omega systems which are all covered in the proposed course .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #113:6>
In addition , because of the now modern 1991 GPS systems all of their future navigation work will conceivably employ GPS .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #114:6>
This advanced training will include approximately 50 hours flying experience .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #115:6>
Air survey and advanced navigation training are not available in East Malaysia .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #116:6>
In the past the International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences ( ITC ) in the Netherlands offered the only available training in these areas and their course has been closed since August 1990 , leaving <unclear-word> as the sole provider .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #117:6>
The ITC course was a combined foundation/advanced course lasting 12 months but University College has divided training into a foundation ( Certificate in Air Survey ) and several advanced courses , including the combined Advanced Navigation and GPS Navigation .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #118:6>
The proposed course dates are to be confirmed .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #119:6>
The cost of tuition is &pound-sign;<@>10</@> and the course will be based at Yaxley , Cambridgeshire .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #120:6>
We would be grateful if you would consider providing funding for <unclear-word> to attend the course as outlined above and look forward to hearing from you with any queries you might have .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #121:6>
Yours sincerely ,

<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #125:7>
<unclear-word> Department
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #126:7>
Dear <unclear-word>
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #127:7>
Further to our recent meeting , I wanted to confirm some of the points we made and to let you know the results of my discussions with <unclear-word> re the <unclear-word> proposal .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #128:7>
First of all , we see no problem with the proposal that <unclear-word> take over the running of the EEC Intensive Foundation Summer School at Bentham House , especially if this arrangement is more beneficial to the Laws Faculty .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #129:7>
<unclear-word> has pointed out to me , however , that if <unclear-word> wishes to use the <unclear-word> logo , this must be negotiated with UCLi 's Technical Transfer group who control and monitor the trademark 's use outside the College or by a third party .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #130:7>
I am sure that this will not present any problem but it is worth noting .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #131:7>
You will also need to consider the cost of room space at Bentham House and build this into your budget .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #132:7>
I am not sure whether Eurocom will be charged at the internal or external rate but the Faculty Clerk can give you some direction on this .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #133:7>
You will also need to build in something for college for indirect cost recovery and we can discuss this when you are putting your budget together .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #134:7>
Finally , you will be asked to return student numbers on the Continuing Education Return ( CER ) by the Registry so that the Faculty of Laws and UCL receive credit for UFC funding purposes .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #135:7>
Regarding the Foundation and Advanced EEC courses , we 've given this careful consideration and have concluded that without the economies of scale of running these in conjunction with the Intensive course , the marketing costs will be too high .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #136:7>
Even if they were run together again , the EEC courses have a history of heavily subsidised administrative support from UCLi .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #137:7>
The direct costs of administrative support will be charged to each course in future and the labour intensive methods of the past would become very expensive .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #138:7>
I certainly don't want to sound negative , especially in view of the good beginning we have made and I think there are some excellent opportunities for collaboration between us .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #139:7>
What seems clear is that we need to look in new directions .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #140:7>
The UFC funding can only be used for development and we hope that some of the new laws initiatives will be eligible .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #141:7>
I have been in touch with the Training Officer at <unclear-word> both to follow up on their interest in training for overseas lawyers and to initiate a discussion on their overall training needs .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #142:7>
She felt it would be more helpful to have a preliminary discussion just with me and I have arranged to meet with her on 3rd October .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #143:7>
I will obviously keep you informed on the results of this meeting and , hopefully , we can both see her at a later date .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #144:7>
In the meantime , there are a few administrative details to sort out re this year 's conferences .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #145:7>
Could you please let me have a list of those speakers whose fees are to be paid into the laws account and which should be sent cheques .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #146:7>
I would like to get payments out as soon as possible and really want to avoid a lot of messy little payments to your departmental account .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #147:7>
I will be on holiday from Monday , 5th August , for two weeks but <unclear-word> and <unclear-word> can help if there is anything you need while I am away .
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #148:7>
Yours sincerely ,
<ICE-GB:W1B-030 #149:7>

The Romans first conquered Italy , and then mainly with Italian arms the dominions overseas which ultimately extended from the Solway Firth to the Sahara and from Rhine and Danube , or even beyond , to Euphrates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #2:1>
The conquest of Italy was certainly not a process of enslavement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #3:1>
It was attacks by their neighbours , or the fear of such attacks , that gave early Rome the pretexts or motives for reducing them to submission &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #4:1>
in addition , by confiscating some of their lands , the Romans were able to satisfy the land-hunger of their own peasantry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #5:1>
Despite such confiscations , Roman policy was on the whole conciliatory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #6:1>
The Italian peoples were bound to fight in Rome 's wars at their own charge , but they paid no tribute , and retained self-government in their local affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #7:1>
Rome did indeed support the rule of local aristocrats , noble landowners of the same type as ruled at Rome itself , who might be closely linked to the Roman nobility .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #8:1>
Some peoples were actually given Roman citizenship , and their chief men secured high office at Rome .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #9:1>
The Romans themselves saw in this practice a major factor in their rise to world power and traced it back to the legendary origins of their city .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #10:1>
Archaeological and philological evidence in fact confirms that early Rome was the product of a union of Latin and Sabine communes , and there can be no doubt that Rome 's readiness to admit new citizens gave her at each successive stage of her history superiority in sheer manpower over her enemies , which was usually decisive in ancient wars .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #11:1>
Roman citizens , new and old , were settled all over Italy ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #12:1>
and these settlements served to diffuse among peoples of diverse race and speech knowledge of the Latin language and of Roman institutions , which they were increasingly ready to adopt for themselves . 21
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #13:1>
21 [ Brunt. Fall of Rom. Rep. , ch. 2 . ]
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #14:1>
Moreover the Roman citizen communities also enjoyed a substantial measure of municipal self-government .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #15:1>
It became more and more evident to the other Italians that they would lose little in local autonomy and gain much in prestige , protection from Roman magistrates and even political power , if they too could secure the status of citizens .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #16:1>
It was only the rejection of this demand that led them to rise in revolt in 90 B.C. , and in the stress of war Rome conceded what they had sought .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #17:1>
Thus all the Italians came to be Romans , and by the time of Augustus we might speak with reason of the Italians as the imperial people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #18:1>
It is indeed tempting to say that at this time the Italians had become a nation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #19:1>
Cicero constantly appealed to the sentiments of all Italy , and Virgil celebrates the prowess of the Italians who had resisted Aeneas , the prototype of the conquering Roman , and looks forward to the circumstances of his own day , when all had been reconciled and had become &lsquo; Latins of a single speech &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #20:1>
Augustus mobilized Italian prejudices against Antony , who had been seduced by a barbarian concubine into forgetting the gods and customs of Italy . 22
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #21:1>
22 R. Syme , Roman Revolution ( 1935 ) , ch. XX .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #22:1>
Still , it was not Rome that was merged in Italy , but Italy that was absorbed into the Roman citizen body &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #23:1>
the rulers of the world were the Romans ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #24:1>
and the same process that had made Romans out of Italians , many of them derived from an ethnic stock distinct from the first inhabitants of the city , could be , and was , continued to transform provincials in the same way .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #25:1>
I have indeed dwelt on the unification of Italy because in many respects it set the pattern for the wider unity that was to follow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #26:1>
From the third century B.C. Rome was enlarging her dominions beyond the seas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #27:1>
I shall not seek to determine the question how far aggression or fears of aggression by Carthage or by Hellenistic kingdoms or later by northern or eastern peoples provided Rome with motives , as they often provided pretexts , for expansion , or how far the real cause of expansion must be sought in the mere desire for power and glory , or in greed for the profits of empire (
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #28:1>
cf n. 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #29:1>
Schumpeter , in his book on imperialism , traces the &lsquo; unbounded will to conquest &rsquo; which the Romans displayed to a &lsquo; policy of continual preparation for war , the policy of meddlesome interventionism &rsquo; ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #30:1>
and this seems an apt description of much of the process . 23
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #31:1>
23 Imperialism , ch. 3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #32:1>
His account contains many historical solecisms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #33:1>
But a historian of Rome can hardly follow him when he ascribes conquests to the need of the landowning class who governed to divert the minds of the people from agrarian reform to military glory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #34:1>
To say nothing of the fact which he acknowledges that the nobility might themselves be unconscious that their domestic class interests dictated sincerely felt fears for Rome 's safety and of the doubt we might feel in making unconscious motivation a determining factor in events , it was often not the governing class , but agrarian reformers or popular leaders who carried out annexations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #35:1>
Nor , to turn to Marxist or quasi-Marxist interpretations , is there any evidence that slavery was a decisive factor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #36:1>
Like all ancient peoples , the Romans had always had slaves , and their wars increased the supply .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #37:1>
Never were slaves so numerous as in Italy during the first century B.C .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #38:1>
But there is hardly a hint in the texts that any war was prompted by the need for slaves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #39:1>
At most some generals may have embarked on unauthorized expeditions in a lust for booty which included slaves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #40:1>
And in the spoils of empire tribute must be accorded a larger place than booty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #41:1>
Once a people had come under Roman rule , it paid taxes to Rome ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #42:1>
but it was of course immune from slave-raiding .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #43:1>
Free subjects of Rome could not legally be made slaves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #44:1>
It is thus absurd to suggest that the empire was designed to keep up the supply of slaves , especially in the period after Augustus , when the policy was normally to defend the provinces already annexed without enlarging Roman dominions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #45:1>
The provincials were worse off than the Italians in that they had to pay taxes to Rome .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #46:1>
The Romans justified this on the ground that they needed a revenue to pay the army which protected the provincials . 24
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #47:1>
24 E.g. , Tacitus , Histories , IV , 74 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #48:1>
It is significant that they thought it necessary to provide any justification at all .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #49:1>
In their own estimation their rule rested on right and not on mere force &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #50:1>
they were accepting the established doctrine of Greek political philosophy that government exists for the welfare of the governed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #51:1>
The apologia is not quite convincing , since Italy profited as much as the provinces from the Roman peace , and far more from public expenditure , and yet paid little in taxes until c. AD 300 [ p. 515 ] , long after it had lost other privileges .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #52:1>
But at any rate from the time of Augustus Roman arms did secure peace and order .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #53:1>
An Asian orator said in the second century A.D. that men had long thought that the peace was a dream and had woken up to find that it was real . 25

<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #55:1>
This panegyric , translated with commentary by J.H. Oliver , The Ruling Power ( in Transactions of the American Philosophical Society , 1953 ) , is the fullest statement of the admiration for Rome that the upper class in the empire had come to feel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #56:1>
[ See ch. 12 n. 1 . ]
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #57:1>
It lasted on the whole for 250 years :
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #58:1>
nothing like it had been known before , or has been repeated since .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #59:1>
For long it was not the practice of the Romans to govern much . 26
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #60:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #63:1>
the last chapter gives a just appreciation of the limitations of the civilizing work achieved by cities in the eastern part of the Roman empire ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #64:1>
cf. now his Later Roman Empire , ch. XXlV , also dealing with the west .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #65:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #66:1>
The governor had only a small staff ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #67:1>
and he did little more than defend his province , ensure the collection of the taxes and decide the most important criminal and civil cases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #68:1>
The local communities were left in the main to run their own affairs , though everywhere Rome supported oligarchies and would not countenance disorder or attacks on property rights .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #69:1>
By the end of the pre-Christian era , the local communities had become responsible for collecting the imperial direct taxes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #70:1>
Their functions were all the more considerable because their territories were sometimes extensive - about as large as a French department or even larger .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #71:1>
Men of rank and education in the provinces understood that the preponderance of Roman strength doomed resistance or revolt to failure . 27

<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #73:1>
Time helped to reconcile them to a yoke they could not throw off , the more readily because Rome preserved peace , and guaranteed their local liberties and power , and their economic interests .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #74:1>
Gradually they were to gain still more .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #75:1>
In the west groups of Italian settlers provided their neighbours with patterns of a higher and more attractive civilization then than they had developed for themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #76:1>
Without compulsion , though sometimes encouraged by the Roman authorities , the natives began to adopt the Latin language , to build towns of the Italian type , to imitate Graeco-Roman architecture and sculpture , to copy the manners of the Romans .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #77:1>
The process was a long one &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #78:1>
round Trier Celtic was spoken in the early fifth century . 28
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #79:1>
28 [ See ch. 12 App I . ]
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #80:1>
In the Basque country and in Wales the indigenous languages have actually survived , whereas in Gaul Celtic ultimately disappeared with few traces except in place names .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #81:1>
But of course the upper classes , who had most dealings with Roman officials and traders , were most susceptible to Romanization .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #82:1>
As early as the first century A.D. Gauls and Spaniards were contributing to Latin literature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #83:1>
These &eacute;volu&eacute;s sought citizenship 29 and preferment ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #84:1>
and the government , conscious of their merits and of Rome 's traditions , gratified their ambitions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #85:1>
29 There is a good instance in Claudius ' grant of citizenship to a town in Morocco , half Berber , half Punic , which had rendered the Romans good services in suppressing nomad tribes , and petitioned for the grant [
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #86:1>
E.M. Smallwood , Documents ... of Gaius Claudius and Nero , 407 ] .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #87:1>
Rome also relied more and more on provincials to fill the ranks of the army .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #88:1>
They too were partly Romanized by long service in a Latin-speaking force , 30 and were rewarded with the franchise at latest on discharge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #89:1>
30 Velleius ( II , 110 ) says that Pannonians in the army in AD 6 had learned to speak and even read Latin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #90:1>
papyri of soldiers in Egypt ( eg , private letters ) illustrate the process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #91:1>
Since the bureaucracy remained small , the government depended for essential administrative tasks on local magnates in every region &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #92:1>
they too were enfranchised in increasing numbers even in the East , where Latin did not spread , and where Rome was content to uphold and diffuse Greek culture and the Greek language .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #93:1>
Rome had no need , said Aelius Aristides ( cf n. 25 ) , of garrisons in the cities :
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #94:1>
they were held for her by the best people , who had become Romans .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #95:1>
Thus the upper classes in the East too were Romanized at least in sentiment &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #96:1>
here the empire lasted longest , and the subjects of Byzantium were to call themselves Rhomaioi .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #97:1>
Early in the third century the citizenship was bestowed on almost all the inhabitants of the empire by a single edict .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #98:1>
This was only the culmination of a long process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #99:1>
But citizenship no longer carried with it equal rights under the law &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #100:1>
the upper classes were privileged , enjoying a sort of benefit of clergy . 31
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #101:1>
31 [ P. Garnsey , Social Status and Legal Privilege in the Roman Empire ( 1970 ) , with my review in JRS 1972 . ]
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #102:1>
Nor did it involve the intense patriotism of the old city state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #103:1>
Its chief importance lay in the fact that by luck or merit citizens could rise to the chief posts in the government . 32
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #104:1>
32 R. Syme , Colonial &Eacute;lites , ( 1958 ) , ch I , illustrates the process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #105:1>
Under Rome such men as Nehru or Nkrumah would have been eligible for the highest imperial offices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #106:1>
In the third century most senators were not Italians .
<ICE-GB:W2A-001 #107:1>
From Trajan onwards most emperors came from the provinces and the eternal city celebrated its millennium in A.D. 247 under the rule of an Arab sheikh .

The Text of the Unconscious
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #13:1>
Just as the Imagist and Surrealist practices of a poetry based on the single image seem diametrically opposed , so the two major theorists of the imagery of the unconscious and its relation to art , Sigmund Freud and Andr&eacute; Breton , are strongly divergent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #14:1>
All Freud 's early , major works on normal psychology 10 reveal that the dynamics of the mind rely on unconscious forces rather than intelligence &semi; they show the thoughts , imagery and even vocabulary of the mind to be driven by a process of ( visual and/or linguistic ) association , rather than one of logical analysis or deduction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #15:1>
Much that had been considered conscious became unconscious , but much of what was now a newly expanded category of the unconscious took on a new purposefulness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #16:1>
The unconscious - whether expressed in terms of madness , desire , infantile wishes , humour or dream - ceased to be trivial , meaningless , dominated by consciousness and absorbed into its interpretative modes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #17:1>
This theory of the mind has implications for the process of artistic creation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #18:1>
The mind is conflictual , and has no overarching homogenizing faculty like Coleridge 's &lsquo; imagination &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #19:1>
Indeed , for Freud , the unconscious itself totally lacks imagination ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #20:1>
it harbours only desire and destruction -
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #21:1>
where imagination intervenes it is as a subsidiary process , transforming unacceptable unconscious drives into symbolic forms that the ego can cope with .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #22:1>
In stark contrast to Coleridge , Freud argues that the imagination is driven by desire , not by vision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #23:1>
Yet ultimately Freud 's revolutionary theories of the mind share with Symbolism a bias towards an oblique view of mental sense .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #24:1>
There is a hidden plane of meaning ( the unconscious for Freud &semi; the imagination , perhaps the divine , in Symbolism ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #25:1>
The transcendental plane in Freud is internal , but has Platonic overtones 11 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #26:1>
Its true forms are hidden emotional forces which we can never know directly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #27:1>
These forces can be known and expressed only indirectly , through the condensations and displacements of dream imagery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #28:1>
The censorious ego uses these narrative paths , based on association , to bestow acceptable formulation on the basically unknowable and unformulable latent dream thoughts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #29:1>
Thus it is not the primal desire which is formulated &semi; the manifest content produced by the dream work is a recombination of the ( visual or linguistic ) residue associated with the desire .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #30:1>
Thus , as with Mallarm&eacute; 's Symbolism , we have not a one-to-one system of symbolism , but an enigmatic , conflictual model of signification , where the text overtly delivered is a trace of the struggle towards meaning .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #31:1>
Powerfully , however , Freud appears to remove the privilege of meaningful fantasy and narrative skill from the sovereign domain of the poet .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #32:1>
Each dreamer poeticizes his/her own self-sufficient truth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #33:1>
Yet coexisting with this indirect and private system , there is in Freud 's dream theory an entailment that dream images of erotic desire ( however enigmatic and circumstantial the narrative which embeds them ) partake of a universal symbolism , just as there is a concomitant entailment of their readability : the dream becomes a text to renarrate , to revise , to listen to , to read , to analyse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #34:1>
It becomes a medium of psychic exchange and cultural significance , like the literary text , or the joke .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #35:1>
In fact , communicability of experience in narrative form , and the transformation of experience through that very narrative (re)structuring , is vital to Freud 's project .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #36:1>
Freud 's most explicit theory of artistic creativity is that it is a kind of disguised wish-fulfilment ( just as he argues of dreams ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #37:1>
He supposes in &lsquo; Creative Writers and Day Dreaming &rsquo; ( SE , IX &semi; Pelican 14 ) that the artist and the neurotic are essentially similar , that unhappiness leads to &lsquo; phantasy &rsquo; &semi; and that art is a kind of &lsquo; aesthetic forepleasure &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #38:1>
The model is based on the premise that instinctual urges are blocked by our rational minds , that the frustrated energy has to be released through acceptable channels in &lsquo; sublimated &rsquo; form , and that sublimation is in fact a creative , as it were artistic , process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #39:1>
The work of art , then , is motivated and structured just like the dream &semi; its import is resumed in a leading image &semi; that image bears an unconscious structure beneath its superficial plastic significance and effect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #40:1>
In chapter 15 below , Elizabeth Wright has drawn attention to the aesthetic implications of the theory of the uncanny in Freud 's essay on E.T.A. Hoffmann 's tale The Sandman , where irrational images loom up from forgotten childhood and inform mature art-works 12 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #41:1>
But it is Wilhelm Jensen 's Gradiva , structured - like Hoffmann 's story - around an obsession with an erotically exciting but radically displaced female image ( a violent female automaton in The Sandman , a delicate female sculpture in Gradiva ) , which provided Freud with his most detailed reconstruction of the artistic process of the representation of desire .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #42:1>
In Freud 's major essay on creativity , Delusions and Dreams in Jensen 's &lsquo; Gradiva &rsquo; , 13 repressed desire for a woman ( Zoe Bertgang ) surreptitiously motivates the hero 's interest in an artistic female image ( the look-alike sculpture which he names Gradiva ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #43:1>
The hero , Norbert Hanold , is a dessicated archaeologist , who suddenly fixates upon the image of the oddly-poised foot of an attractive girl in an antique bas-relief .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #44:1>
He finds himself driven to observe girls ' legs in the street , and his attempt to fit the image into his scientific practice is disturbed by strange inner feelings , and then by a dramatic dream , where he and Gradiva are being buried by the eruption of Vesuvius at Pompeii , and she lies down to sleep on a marble slab .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #45:1>
Once awakened from this dream , he seems to recognize the girl outside in the street , and rushes out clad only in his dressing gown .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #46:1>
He pursues his scientific quest by travelling to Rome to study the original sculpture , but he is disturbed by honeymoon couples and by a second dream , where Apollo carries off Venus and lays her down on a ramshackle cart .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #47:1>
He finally arrives in Pompeii , having forgotten his dream of Vesuvius , and when he apparently meets there the living original of Gradiva , he feels that he is dreaming , and invites her to lie down again as she had done in his previous vision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #48:1>
Hanold 's scientific study gives way to a frankly obsessive search for his mysteriously revived vision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #49:1>
He finds himself buying a dubious souvenir brooch of a pair of lovers mummified in flagrante at Pompeii , stumbling into an antique house decorated with lubricious frescoes , offering Gradiva flowers , and dreaming of a lizard , snared by Gradiva , gobbled up by a bird .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #50:1>
All the while he is dogged by occasional apparitions of the attractive but demure Zoe , whom he takes to be a Greek statue reincarnated , until he finally yields , both to the mood of the neighbouring honeymooners and to the evidence that the real Gradiva is his long-forgotten childhood playmate Zoe who has chased him to Pompeii in the wake of her father , a naturalist , and that he loves her .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #51:1>
Jensen 's charming , witty , richly suggestive story , written in 1903 , has many features which suggest the active presence of a specifically Freudian unconscious .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #52:1>
There are actes manqu√às : Hanold loses his way and finds by accident an unsuspected hotel at Pompeii , where Gradiva is staying &semi; he stumbles into a culturally unedifying building at Pompeii whose rude frescoes he had not intended to study , and interrupts the embrace of a pair of honeymooners who turn out to be friends of Gradiva 's .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #53:1>
There are slips of the tongue : Hanold asks Gradiva to lie down for him when he intends only to see if she matches the shape of the girl on the marble slab .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #54:1>
There is repression and sublimation : Hanold represses his nascent desire for the figure of his childhood girlfriend by forgetting her existence , by burying himself in aesthetic and mathematical study of the disturbing image of the attractive girl in the bas-relief , by talking to her in ancient Greek .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #55:1>
Above all , there are dreams , where real events from Hanold 's life become significantly transformed , in an overtly erotic symbolism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #56:1>
In one the girl lies down to be buried alive among the stones and lava of Pompeii , as if buried beneath the rubble of Hanold 's antiquarian studies , but she lies down as if in bed &semi; in another Apollo abducts Venus and prostrates her , although the sleeping Hanold has tried to avoid noticing the sound of a honeymoon couple in the adjoining hotel bedroom .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #57:1>
The real lizards chased by Zoe 's father and the real canary from the cage at her bedroom window merge into a third dream the source of whose anxiety could as easily be fear of sexuality as fear of marriage : Gradiva lassoes a hapless lizard and allows it to be snapped up by a passing bird .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #58:1>
This anxiety dream is the more striking for not being transformed by the dreamer into an erudite classical model , as the first two dreams were .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #59:1>
Freud has been much praised for his reading of this story .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #60:1>
Yet he makes rather heavy weather of it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #61:1>
He worries unduly over whether Hanold 's hallucinations are realistic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #62:1>
He glosses over the parapraxes and slips of the tongue ( although he had recently written a considerable tome on these phenomena , showing how they revealed the unconscious ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #63:1>
He doesn't seem interested in the fact that Hanold forgets his first , archaeological , dream until he finds himself in the Pompeii he had dreamed of .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #64:1>
On the other hand , Freud 's analysis of the three dreams embedded in the story is masterly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #65:1>
More persuasively than with many of his own one-line dreams in The Interpretation of Dreams , Freud shows the process of condensation and displacement of Hanold 's desire , as the &lsquo; latent meaning &rsquo; is transposed into the &lsquo; manifest content &rsquo; using the residue of the previous day .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #66:1>
He lays bare the mechanisms that construct a narrative whose secondary revisions are attempts to deny the very desire which it expresses , a desire which is nonetheless readable by the analyst who knows how to unscramble the code of the dream unconscious , where persons are interchangeable , the time is always the present , where positives may signify negatives and vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #67:1>
Freud wants to avoid the suggestion , that Jensen , his contemporary , was consciously using his ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #68:1>
He wants the artist 's insights to confirm his , the scientist 's , independently .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #69:1>
Hence no doubt Freud 's repression of his own vocabulary of the parapraxis , the slip of the tongue &semi; hence , even more importantly , his avoidance of any mention of over-obviously &lsquo; Freudian &rsquo; symbolism : yet the image of Gradiva lassoing the lizard with a blade of grass and then offering it up to the beak of a passing bird is potentially as good a symbol of castration anxiety as that of the eyes which are threatened by the Sandman in the Hoffmann tale analysed in The Uncanny .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #70:1>
In this attempt to find an artistic confirmation and hence consecration of his science , Freud avoids as far as possible the erotic overtones of the recumbent Gradiva , the half-dressed Hanold , Venus 's creaky bedsprings , and so on .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #71:1>
One curious result of this is that what is repressed appears to be no more than a sage , sweet , nuptial love , rather than erotic desire &semi; and , as such , it seems hardly worth repressing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #72:1>
If this repression lies behind Hanold 's obsessions and hallucinations , the modern reader , armed with the later Freud , would want to know what lay behind that repression .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #73:1>
And indeed , if Freud is able to found his reading of Gradiva on the overlap between two limpid and graceful female images , the bas-relief and the girl that it echoes , it is no doubt because this is a piece of early Freud , written at a time when his ideas on the Oedipus complex and infantile desire were still quite fluid .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #74:1>
In fact , this article furnishes one of the stages in Freud 's developing theories , with his discussion of Hanold 's forgetting of his aggressively physical childhood games with Zoe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #75:1>
Freud also entirely ignores the death wish in Hanold 's first and third dream 14 whilst he is enchanted with the metaphor of archaeology for memory unevenly buried in an unstable mental terrain ( a metaphor which was to become one of his most creative models of the mind ) &semi; he ignores the potential violence of Jensen 's images of burial , flattening , cutting , measuring .
<ICE-GB:W2A-002 #76:1>
Some of Jensen 's non -dream images - the mummified lovers , the lewd frescoes - seem now to the Post-Freudian reader of this late Symbolist fiction to reveal Jensen 's own precocious ability to symbolize the destructive frenzy of the repressed libido .

Introduction
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #2:1>
There are two things that this book is not .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #3:1>
It is not an analysis of Coleridge 's work in the light of one particular intellectual discipline :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #4:1>
therefore it is a study of Coleridge not as literary critic , nor as theologian , nor as philosopher , nor as historian , nor as a political or a social thinker .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #5:1>
Chameleon-like , he put on the colours of all these in the course of his career , but his contribution to English life and thought cannot be defined within any one of these terms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #6:1>
I have begun with one presumption , one hostage to intellectual fortune , which nonetheless I take to be a matter of faith first and then experience to those who write on Coleridge - that his work is in principle an entity with a developing vision and life of its own , that his poetic , critical , philosophical , political , and theological writings are related as parts to a whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #7:1>
Coleridge 's powers of synthesis did not cease with his production of poetry , and his originality lies more in synthesizing a whole out of established parts , less in his particular contributions to the disciplines he employed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #8:1>
So this book is an attempt at construction , not deconstruction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #9:1>
But the pitfalls of choosing a method at odds with accepted practice are obvious , and I can only hope I have avoided tumbling into the deepest and the darkest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #10:1>
And just as it is the development of this body of work that is the focus of my interest , and not Coleridge 's contribution to , or conformation with , distinct forms of intellectual practice , so this book is not a description of Coleridge 's return to Christian orthodoxy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #11:1>
He always proclaimed himself a Christian , and it is as foolish to pretend that Christianity has no positive influence on his development as it is to suppose that it alone provides a method of interpreting his canon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #12:1>
But Christian orthodoxy is a tag too often used to dismiss those aspects of Coleridge 's thought that modern readers either believe they understand , or think of as dull and irrelevant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #13:1>
And it is sometimes coupled to a charge of Coleridge collapsing through a drug-induced fatigue into a snug intellectual cocoon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #14:1>
Nothing could be farther from the truth :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #15:1>
that Coleridge sought the metaphysical significance of the major Christian doctrines is a matter of fact , but what is interesting about his theology is that it always seeks a ground in human experience , and never presumes that a doctrine is a self-sufficient statement of an a priori truth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #16:1>
He sees doctrine as representing living powers in the form of real ideas , as a description of our humanity , and therefore as a method of enlivening rather than fossilizing the intellect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #17:1>
There were no truths , however revered , that Coleridge allowed to lie bed-ridden in the dormitory of his soul .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #18:1>
It is harder to say what this book is , than what it is not .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #19:1>
Uppermost in my mind was the integrity of Coleridge 's achievement - that far from being , say , a poet who lost his muse in metaphysics , or a Christian platonist who took refuge in orthodoxy , he was a man struggling to unite the various forms of thought into one living and life-giving whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #20:1>
I began with the conviction that Coleridge 's mature thinking had its origins in a poetic method distinct from and opposed to that of Wordsworth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #21:1>
In the latter 's best poetry we remain happily uncertain of the relative priority of nature and the mind , but in his description of the bland and unconvincing redemptive processes undergone , say , by Peter Bell and the Solitary , he revealed that he was content to think that nature was more acting than acted upon , that the mind was more easily conceived as a thing made than a thing making .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #22:1>
I believe that Coleridge , in his poems of the supernatural , did quite the opposite :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #23:1>
beginning with the truths of our inward nature , those truths not subject to time and place , he sought to create a sensible world , permitting the reader to see that the mind orders the senses and not the senses the mind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #24:1>
However , throughout their lives Wordsworth and Coleridge shared the belief that the laws or principles of nature are at one with the ideas that constitute our humanity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #25:1>
But as the investigation of nature developed quickly in the century , the distinction between the appearances and the laws of nature became more and more significant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #26:1>
This distinction hardly worried Wordsworth at all , for from his youth his heart had been intimately bound up in certain great appearances of nature , and to these he clung as to the raft of his inspiration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #27:1>
But Coleridge became increasingly frustrated by the difficulty of discerning how the laws of nature are co-ordinate with the truths or ideas of mind &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #28:1>
and though he never abandoned a belief from which arose some of his most remarkable meditations on the relations between the two , I believe he tacitly ceased to hope that he could demonstrate that nature was an object of knowledge adequate to his conception of our humanity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #29:1>
From the &lsquo; wily old Witch &rsquo; , he turned to the more pliable muse of History , and there , especially in his study of Hebraic history , found an object which , with considerable refinement , was able to express his complex understanding of the subject , the humanity of man .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #30:1>
His study of Vico , who denied the knowabilty knowability of Nature and asserted that of History , may well have assisted him to achieve more in this field than he laid claim to , and much more than anyone else has since attributed to him .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #31:1>
To chart the progress of this development was my original intention .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #32:1>
But what soon attracted my attention was Coleridge 's frequent assertions as only being conscious of himself in his relations with and love of other people :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #33:1>
these occur with the greatest frequency in the notebooks of the Malta period , when he was separated from the Wordsworths , Sara Hutchinson and his children .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #34:1>
It seemed to me that as Coleridge approached nature in his mature thinking , beginning with the idea and seeking to arrive at sense , so he found that the substance of an individual lay not in their presence , but in their inward and invisible being .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #35:1>
By contrast , Wordsworth rarely conceived of people in separation from what he was able to observe of them and their situation &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #36:1>
it is no accident that the characters of Wordsworth 's contributions to the Lyrical Ballads are largely &lsquo; taken from life &rsquo; , and that those of Coleridge originate as figures of his imagination :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #37:1>
his sense of a person was often most sure when they were absent from him , when he was able to distinguish their inward nature from their outward appearance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #38:1>
With these thoughts in mind , I turned back to the poetry again , for up to this point I had mostly been concerned with making a distinction between those poems in which Coleridge seems to think of nature as mind-making , and others in which it seems predominantly mind-made &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #39:1>
and of course what I found was that almost all his poetry is filled with expressions of his need for and love of other people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #40:1>
In those poems in which he seemed to believe that nature was mind-making , such expressions are in contrast or in conflict with the actions of nature , and the twin motions of Coleridge 's heart and mind at first appear irreconcilable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #41:1>
But his willingness to put another person at the centre of experience , and always a person more or less ideally conceived and deeply loved , provides a method of reconciliation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #42:1>
In this conventional analysis of Coleridge 's poetry , I have attempted a methodological distinction between the Conversation and the Supernatural poems , a distinction which I believe is resolved in &lsquo; Kubla Khan &rsquo; and &lsquo; Dejection . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #43:1>
These chapters are therefore both a schematic rehearsal of the current understanding of Coleridge 's poetry , and a laying of the foundations for his intellectual development .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #44:1>
My purpose then became to show how Coleridge 's development of the idea of a person enabled him to find in history rather than nature the adequate and correlative object .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #45:1>
Although his supernatural poems offer some evidence that he was willing to conceive of the reality of human nature as independent of time and space , there is less evidence that this tenet had ever been tempered in the fire of personal experience .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #46:1>
However , during the long and crucial period from about 1801 to 1814 , this became the dominant theme of his thought .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #47:1>
His love for Sara Hutchinson was then his greatest reality , and because he considered his marriage indissoluble , he struggled to see how Asra , as he coded her name in his notebooks , could exist for him and be loved by him in separation from the forms of temporal and corporal experience .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #48:1>
Out of this heroic if not always glorious struggle , Coleridge emerged profoundly conscious of the inter-relations of love , human consciousness and personal immortality - aware , one might say , that the ground of all human life had its ineffable and unalterable existence in God alone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #49:1>
It is the achievements of these years that I regard as crucial to Coleridge 's career , and it is the idea of person that I believe provides the unifying force in Coleridge 's intellectual development .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #50:1>
Coleridge sought explanation of and expression for his private experience within the tradition of Christianity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #51:1>
Because he refused to dissociate his experience from his belief , he sought to re-think , re-explain and render properly metaphysical doctrines which had become petrified in the material language of Paley and the mechanists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #52:1>
To follow this aspect of Coleridge 's development is the business of Chapter 6 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #53:1>
The presence of God in us Coleridge called Reason , but it exists for us as God exists , a matter of faith and not of fact , and is therefore dependent upon an act of will .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #54:1>
The possibility of experience depends upon the Understanding , which provides the forms by which we order the sensations derived from phenomena .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #55:1>
This faculty may of course exist independently of Reason , as it does in most of us most of the time , but because the Reason would speak of that which is not of time and space , which is invisible and incorporeal , it is dependent upon the Understanding for its expression .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #56:1>
Because Reason is the groundwork of our distinct humanity , and the Understanding the basis of our being in time , their conjunction or union will create a person - and this incarnational relationship was , Coleridge thought , uniquely perfected in Christ .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #57:1>
It is our duty to our humanity to effect this union of Reason and Understanding within ourselves , for only in this way is the person fully realized .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #58:1>
The power that enables this union Coleridge categorized as the imagination , which has its basis in an act of will .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #59:1>
In its primary form this power neither begins with sense-presented material nor produces an object for the senses :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #60:1>
what it does produce is an object for the mind , or a series of objects expressed as symbols which are part and parcel of the ideas that constitute our humanity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #61:1>
It is through this primary act of the imagination that we find our proper and divinely human being .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #62:1>
One significant aspect of these symbols is that not only are they the life of the &lsquo; infant Christ &rsquo; in our souls , but that they also represent the progress of his unique and historical life &semi; that is they have an &lsquo; outness &rsquo; , and therefore where we find life , we do not find it in abstraction from experience , but as its foundation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #63:1>
The function of the secondary imagination is to reconcile the revealed life within us with the world we find without us , a reconciliation which , prima facie , is more easily realized in respect of history than of nature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #64:1>
It may seem an anomaly to outline the structure of the primary and secondary imaginations without first considering the source of that famous distinction and definition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #65:1>
I have done so because I believe that , philosophically , the Biographia is an aberration in Coleridge 's thinking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #66:1>
It seems to me that every form of personal mediation which , first appearing in the Supernatural poems , had become central to his thinking , is abandoned , and nature made a direct or primary object , when it has only ever been an indirect or secondary object - the primary object having always been a person in the form of constitutive ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #67:1>
This has consequences in his criticism , and I try to trace them , but my main reservation about this work does not concern its value as literary criticism :
<ICE-GB:W2A-003 #68:1>
it is the belief that not only did Coleridge , unable to draw on his most intimate and &lsquo; forbidden &rsquo; experiences , put himself off his proper thought , but he also succeeded in putting off nearly all his subsequent commentators .

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #9:1>
Written in English over the period from 1929 to 1938 , Beckett 's early work seems restless , nomadic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #10:1>
It straddles two cultures , the Anglo-Irish and the continental , and interweaves two styles of discourse , bohemian iconoclasm and academic bookishness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #11:1>
The effect is of instability , in tone , literary register , genre and idiom , the result impermeability rather than clarity , and Beckett 's language a record of disruption rather than communication .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #12:1>
Beckett 's readers have often acknowledged the unsettled character of the author 's early prose and poems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #13:1>
One argument is that Beckett , in the 1930s , was still searching , unsuccessfully , for his own personal voice and needed to rid himself of an excess of learning. 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #14:1>
To say this , however , is immediately to be committed to a series of problematical assumptions about the status of voice in Beckett 's fiction as a whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #15:1>
For what the argument inevitably implies is that , because it came later , Beckett 's trilogy , say , is purer , more unified , more authentic , less discontinuous , than the early writings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #16:1>
Yet however much one might prefer the trilogy over earlier texts , the criteria of purity , continuity and authenticity create more problems than they solve .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #17:1>
The later novels require a more sceptical response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #18:1>
Second , to take Beckett 's early work , the essays on Joyce or Proust , the stories in More Pricks Than Kicks or the novel Murphy , as being important for what they tell us about Beckett 's better known later writings , is to grant these early texts secondary status , while still claiming that they contain more transparent evidence of the author 's underlying intentions and his formative ( yet already formed ) ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #19:1>
The contradiction seems plainly untenable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #20:1>
In the past Beckett criticism has not always avoided these pitfalls .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #21:1>
Repeatedly , the essays on Proust or Joyce have been scoured for statements that might be applied to Beckett 's own fiction and More Pricks Than Kicks and Murphy pillaged for what they say ( or may be persuaded to say ) about their author 's vision of the world or philosophic beliefs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #22:1>
This has tended to obscure to what extent Beckett 's early writings possess a coherent , though dislocated rhetoric of their own , which Beckett develops , in various ways , sporadically at times , and at others dogmatically , across both some of his critical pieces and his experiments with novel and short story .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #23:1>
In systematic terms , that rhetoric is most clearly articulated in the 1929 piece on Joyce 's future Finnegans Wake , the essay &lsquo; Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce &rsquo; , and in Beckett 's 1931 monograph on Proust. 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #24:1>
This is why it is worth looking closely again at these early essays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #25:1>
The aim is not to begin thinking about Beckett 's early fiction as a thematic redrafting of the novels of his two predecessors ( once a critical commonplace ) , nor is it to use the essays as sources for Beckett 's own alleged opinions or ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #26:1>
More pertinent for the present discussion is an assessment of the method adopted by Beckett in his readings of Joyce and Proust .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #27:1>
One of the distinctive features of the two essays is their preference for criticism as explication rather than as an act of measured evaluation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #28:1>
It is not that the essays are free of value judgements , content with describing neutrally the functioning of the two texts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #29:1>
On the contrary , Beckett is seldom other than peremptory and polemical in his references to received opinion or other literary works .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #30:1>
If Beckett makes few value judgements in his text , it is because his whole position is one of assertive though ungrounded evaluation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #31:1>
In refusing to play the detached observer , Beckett identifies himself in a brashly partisan way with the text he is reading .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #32:1>
When explicit value judgements do occur , as when Beckett introduces his account of Proust 's &lsquo; Les Intermittences du c&oeligature;ur &rsquo; ( P , 39 ) , it is to castigate the audience and promote the text ( even when this might mean , in Beckett 's view , defending it against itself ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #33:1>
But Beckett does not use criticism as an excuse for paying homage to a master , and the biographic person of the author is singularly lacking from his essays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #34:1>
Proust is prefaced by a short note declining all interest in the &lsquo; life and death of Marcel Proust &rsquo; ( P , 9 ) , and much the same is true of the Joyce essay , though the collection in which it appeared , initially in transition , then in Our Exagmi<l>nation round His Factification ... , had an obvious celebratory function . 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #35:1>
Rather , criticism is undertaken by Beckett as an act of submission to the terms of the text he is discussing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #36:1>
The only valid criteria , in the case of Proust and Joyce , are those already contained in the text , and Beckett 's essays take it as their central purpose to propound ( and extrapolate from ) the aesthetic system of the novels concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #37:1>
Thus , with Joyce , Beckett concentrates on the relevance of Vico 's cyclical theory of history , while with Proust he makes no distinction between Proust the author and the narrator of A la recherche du temps perdu , drawing extensively on the comments of the latter as a way of organising his own essay .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #38:1>
One effect of this is that when Beckett has the &lsquo; impertinence &rsquo; , as he puts it ( P , 75 ) , to criticise the text ( this happens only three times in Proust ) , it is in the name of its own logic , as Beckett construes it , and not extraneous values .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #39:1>
To this extent , by illustrating the underlying method of his subjects , what Beckett often ends up doing is pushing the terms of the text into hyperbolic overstatement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #40:1>
Thus the description of Habit as &lsquo; the ballast that chains the dog to his vomit &rsquo; ( P , 19 ) mainly serves to underline Beckett 's own habit of pugnacious advertisement of a classic Proustian theme .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #41:1>
Beckett 's readings are identificatory rather than evaluative , explicative rather than appreciative , synthetic rather than analytic ( Proust is presented at one point by Beckett as a &lsquo; synthesis &rsquo; ) , and , as any reader familiar with A la recherche will realise , the sheer amount of paraphrase in Beckett 's text is overwhelming . 4
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #42:1>
The uncompromising nature of Beckett 's declared commitment to his subjects is such that he might with good reason pass for little more than an apologist .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #43:1>
Beckett brooks no objections on grounds of obscurity or difficulty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #44:1>
Of Proust 's novel he declares that &lsquo; the complaint that it is an involved style , full of periphrasis , obscure and impossible to follow , has no foundation whatsoever &rsquo; ( P , 88 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #45:1>
In rebutting a similar reaction to Joyce 's &lsquo; Work in Progress &rsquo; , Beckett delivers the following , famous tirade :
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X46:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X47:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X48:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X49:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #50:1>
( D , 26 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #51:1>
The attack on cultural decadence has a familiar ring , recalling many of the claims being made in the 1920s and 1930s by the literary avant-garde , Futurists , Surrealists , Joycians and others alike .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #52:1>
In the process , Beckett commits himself to a by now routine modernist conception of the autonomy of the literary text and the indissoluble unity of form with content .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #53:1>
He dismisses the idea of separating the two by insisting that &lsquo; the one is a concretion of the other , the revelation of a world &rsquo; ( P , 88 ) and that , in &lsquo; Work in Progress &rsquo; , &lsquo; form is content , content is form &rsquo; ( D , 27 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #54:1>
Fusion here results from the innovative use of language , and in turn Beckett observes &lsquo; for Proust the quality of language is more important than any system of ethics or aesthetics &rsquo; ( P , 88 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #55:1>
The autonomy enjoyed by the work of art means that the text is not only independent of extraneous value systems , but also irreducible to a mimetic theory of art ( in the unpublished &lsquo; Dream of Fair to Middling Women &rsquo; Beckett writes off Balzac as relying on a &lsquo; proc&eacute;d&eacute; that seems all falsity &rsquo; [ D , 46 ] ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #56:1>
Instead , according to Beckett , the literary text works as a dynamic whole in which substance and architecture , theme and structure come together to form a rhythmic whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #57:1>
Speaking of Joyce 's use of Vico as a &lsquo; structural convenience - or inconvenience &rsquo; , Beckett explains :
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X58:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X59:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #60:1>
( D , 22 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #61:1>
Likewise , Proust 's novel is treated as a self-correlating , dynamic texture of language , in which symbolic relationships are generated from the sheer density of the language and not imposed by the author allegorically .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #62:1>
In Proust ( and the claim originates with Proust 's narrator ) , there is no divorce between sensible and intelli<l>gible , between an impression and its sense .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #63:1>
, Beckett comments , ( P , 79 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #64:1>
, he adds , ( P , 80 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #65:1>
Proust 's symbolism is an &lsquo; autosymbolism &rsquo; ( P , 80 ) , fusing together the two sides of the linguistic split between real and ideal , signifier and signified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #66:1>
The literary texts Beckett is describing transgress the stable contrasted oppositions of non-literary discourse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #67:1>
This is the second of Beckett 's emphases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #68:1>
As the literary hoists language clear from its fixed dichotomies , what the text uncovers is not a world of pacific transcendence , of dualisms incorporated and effaced , but rather its opposite , an endless circle of interpenetrating differences and unredeemed contrasts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #69:1>
Prompted by Joyce , Beckett focusses closely on this motif of the &lsquo; coincidence of contraries &rsquo; ( D , 21 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #70:1>
This is Bruno 's contribution to &lsquo; Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce &rsquo; , and Beckett expounds it as follows :
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X71:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X72:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X73:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #75:1>
( D , 21 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #76:1>
The coincidence of contraries affirms the relativity and instability of all fixed points .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #77:1>
Each position , each meaning becomes answerable to at least two antagonistic systems , occupying a provisional place in the round of language , constantly being displaced or undermined by its opposite ( itself similarly unstable ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #78:1>
The autonomy of the literary text is an autonomy without homogeneity : what it describes is a mobile process of perpetual commingling in which each element continually passes into its contrary by a sequence of circular transmutations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #79:1>
Extremes meet : unity disperses into multiplicity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #80:1>
Beckett 's reading of Proust is informed by a similar sense of duplicity and reversal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #81:1>
His account of A la recherche is guided by a series of self-inverting or self-displacing thematic and structural figures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #82:1>
These are isolated under the headings : Time , Habit , and Memory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #83:1>
Proust 's novel , says Beckett , is a novel of multiplicities but the multiplicities behave like dualisms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #84:1>
The presiding divinity of A la recherche is Janus , who always faces both ways and extracts from apparent unity the divisiveness of perpetual reversal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #85:1>
Thus Beckett on involuntary memory stresses the crucial dual identity of Time , Habit and Memory , each poisoning the hero 's life precisely to the extent that it is also , inescapably , a remedy for the symptoms it creates ( P , 35 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #86:1>
Proustian memory , then , behaves according to what Derrida , using the same metaphor , describes as the logic of the pharmakon : poison and remedy , the one because the other , the one despite the other , retracing and suspending in one movement the bar of opposition which differentiates the two meanings and allows them to exist. 5
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #87:1>
In Beckett 's account , the literary text follows a similar logic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #88:1>
Like memory , it is predicated on a movement of passage and transformation by which contraries merge and fuse and unity reveals its hidden freight of swarming dispersion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #89:1>
Proust 's text bears the mark of this inner reversibility like a dual signature : &lsquo; each spear may be a spear of Telephus &rsquo; ( P , 11 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #90:1>
Undermining difference , this logic of reversal carries writing towards the infinity of myth and revelation , not myth as a symptom of cultural stability but myth as a process of unending verbal condensation and displacement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #91:1>
Writing redistributes the verbal surface of the world and illuminates its underlying dynamic by dramatising , writes Beckett , in a close paraphrase of Proust , an &lsquo; experience [ ... ] at once imaginative and empirical , at once an evocation and a direct perception , real without being merely actual , ideal without being merely abstract , the ideal real , the essential , the extratemporal &rsquo; ( P , 75 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #92:1>
Beckett adopts , then , the same method or set of assumptions in approaching both authors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #93:1>
As he does so , Beckett does not compile a personal anthology of commonplaces , nor foist a series of idiosyncratic views on two unwilling authors ( as critics have mooted in the past ) , but rather puts in place an embryonic theory of modern fiction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #94:1>
It is a theory committed to defending the autonomy of literary texts and it defines fiction as an activity of language in which , paradoxically , the foundations of meaning are attacked by the uncontrollable , self-inverting character of meaning itself .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #95:1>
Beckett 's approach to Joyce and Proust is not neutral .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #96:1>
He defends their break with tradition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #97:1>
This is evident in the stress laid on how both &lsquo; Work in Progress &rsquo; and A la recherche du temps perdu respond to crisis by redefining the terms within which writing is legitimated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #98:1>
In a review essay devoted to Denis Devlin in 1938 , Beckett speaks of &lsquo; social reality &rsquo; having &lsquo; severed the connexion &rsquo; with art , thus allowing art to rediscover its status as &lsquo; pure interrogation , rhetorical question less the rhetoric &rsquo; ( D , 91 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #99:1>
The response of Joyce and Proust to that severed connection , as Beckett shows , lies in the totalising dynamic which both deploy as a means of giving their writing some foundation or necessity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #100:1>
In Finnegans Wake it has the form of a totalising of language and myth within the cyclical theory of history taken from Vico , while in Proust it is articulated by way of what Beckett rightly terms his &lsquo; religious &rsquo; justification of art .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #101:1>
But it is symptomatic that as Beckett begins his account of &lsquo; Le Temps retrouv√à &rsquo; , he demurs , and impugns the expression , &lsquo; le temps retrouv√à &rsquo; , declaring it inappropriate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #102:1>
For Beckett the dialectic of art does not culminate , as it did , at least in principle , for Proust 's narrator , in an aesthetic &lsquo; adoration perp&eacute;tuelle &rsquo; ( the initial title of Proust 's book ) but rather in a purgatorial structure which knows no end other than its own infinite circularity and sluggish<l>ness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #103:1>
Indeed , for the author of &lsquo; Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce &rsquo; , the literary text knows no closure nor structure of redemption , no transcendence or term .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #104:1>
In its mingling of contraries , its dissolving of unities , what the text embodies is not the world either as paradise or as inferno : it is the world as purgatory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #105:1>
Beckett explains :
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X106:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X107:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #X108:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #118:1>
( D , 33 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #119:1>
The approach Beckett outlines here , displaying paradox and self-contradiction as its motive forces , is not systematic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #120:1>
It is informed by the knowledge that all totalising systems are precarious .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #121:1>
Nonetheless the emphasis on the Janal dynamic of writing and its logic of circularity and reversal is indicative of Beckett 's own understanding of what constitutes a modern literary text .
<ICE-GB:W2A-004 #122:1>
More importantly , the purgatorial aesthetic set out in these early essays provides Beckett with an initial enabling strategy , a rhetorical framework which he explores at greater length , in the fictional mode , in his most important early work , the collection of stories , or episodic novel , More Pricks Than Kicks. 6

ARCHITECTURE , PHILOSOPHY AND THE PUBLIC WORLD
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #2:1>
John Haldane
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X3:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #4:1>
I
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #5:1>
THE STYLE of this quotation indicates its antiquity &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #6:1>
though , of course , there are many today who would echo its sentiments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #7:1>
In aligning themselves with the author , however , they might also be victims of a certain irony the character of which I shall reveal shortly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #8:1>
A contemporary philosopher invited to consider relevant difficulties raised by modern urban redevelopment might think to approach the issues from the direction of either of the now well-established traditions of social philosophy or aesthetics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #9:1>
Among other things , I shall be concerned to suggest that no adequate treatment of the problems is possible unless both perspectives are adopted , or , better still , merged .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #10:1>
Architecture being the paradigm of a public art , its philosophical examination is an exercise in social aesthetics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #11:1>
That these matters are currently a topic of considerable public and pro<l>fessional discussion is due in large part to the several widely reported occasions on which the Prince of Wales has castigated modern architects for producing &lsquo; gross inhuman monstrosities &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #12:1>
Among the targets of these attacks have been the existing layout and buildings of Paternoster Square ( adjacent to St Paul 's Cathedral ) and proposed designs for the redevelopment of the site .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #13:1>
Prince Charles regards both what exists and what has been projected as entirely at odds with the historical character of the surroundings , and in themselves repellent to the search for comfort , delight and inspiration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #14:1>
In these judge<l>ments he is joined by many others who likewise look away from Modernist and Post-Modernist styles of building back towards vernacular and classical designs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #15:1>
In the particular case of Paternoster the Prince has expressed a per<l>sonal preference for the restoration or recreation re-creation of pre-existing patterns .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #16:1>
In his 1987 Mansion House address he spoke as follows :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X17:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X18:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #19:1>
II
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #20:1>
Before commenting on the merits of the Prince 's case it will be as well to recall the point illustrated by the opening quotation , namely : that dissatisfac<l>tion with contemporary architecture is by no means only a twentieth-century phenomenon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #21:1>
Remembering that earlier generations have spoken ill of build<l>ings which are now regarded as masterpieces one may then be wary of the danger of slipping into an unobservant and unreflective reactionary stance , uncritically assuming the superiority of things ancient and identifying change with decline .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #22:1>
The warning is especially apt given the previous older criticism &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #23:1>
for in the same place as he offers it the author also singles out one particular unnamed but easily identifiable City of London redeveloper as having abused his commissions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #24:1>
He writes :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X25:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X26:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X27:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X28:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #29:1>
The architect under censure is Wren , the Cathedral is St Paul 's and the critic is Anthony Ashley Cooper , the Third Earl of Shaftesbury , a writer whose ideas about beauty were of considerable influence in the development of philosophical aesthetics , and yet more widely in the promotion of that ideal of cultivated sensibility among gentlemen of noble birth to which the Prince of Wales is heir .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #30:1>
So much for the irony .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #31:1>
The point is not to side with Shaftesbury , or to suggest that criticism of the new is at any time no more than discomfort with the unfamiliar .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #32:1>
Rather , it is a reminder that there may be aesthetic viewpoints from which what we have come to regard as a paradigm of archi<l>tectural excellence may appear seriously flawed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #33:1>
This , I hasten to add , should not incline one to any simple version of aesthetic relativism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #34:1>
On the contrary , it should encourage us to set aside the too often unexamined , postcard image of great buildings and to ask why they are great and how others could fail to see this .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #35:1>
These questions in turn raise others about those buildings which , at best , fail to engage our admiration , or , at worst , actually repel us .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #36:1>
In short , the facts of disagreement should encourage one to investigate the grounds of aesthetic judgement and the possibilities of establishing by reason<l->giving the superiority of one building or scheme over another .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #37:1>
Too often it is simply assumed that disagreement over values within a community is proof of the subjective character of the rival attitudes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #38:1>
What is more rarely noticed is that a necessary condition of there being such disputes is that all parties to them share a common presupposcd belief in the objectivity of value . 4
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #39:1>
III
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #40:1>
In the matter of the objectivity of aesthetic value the Prince of Wales and the Earl of Shaftesbury are , I think , in broad agreement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #41:1>
But more than this they share a belief in the social importance of good building and in the need for architects to engage the loyalty of the public .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #42:1>
Sadly there can be no doubt that in recent years the social standing of architecture has declined .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #43:1>
Indeed , for so long as the many disasters of post-war building remain in place it is unlikely that the architectural profession will ever be regarded with the sort of admiration , respect and gratitude that was its privilege in , for example , the eighteenth century , in cities such as Edinburgh and Bath .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #44:1>
A loss of public esteem may have many different causes not all of which need reflect badly on those who suffer it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #45:1>
This said , however , a decline in the standing accorded a profession which exists to provide a service to the community suggests , and not just verbally , a decline in the standards which that profession offers in its practice .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #46:1>
Elsewhere , I have argued that architecture in this century has suffered from the pernicious influence of quasi-philosophical ideas . 5
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #47:1>
My concern here , however , is less with the reductionist aesthetics of Modernist and Post-Modernist architecture than with its neglect of the circumstances of city development &semi; more precisely , with its insensitivity to the community-wide social role of building design , i.e. , to the political character of architecture .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #48:1>
The special interest of the Paternoster affair , therefore , is that it raises , in an acute form , several of those issues which a political aesthetic must address .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #49:1>
IV
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #50:1>
The project of inner-city development in a location such as London presents considerable challenges for designers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #51:1>
A concise and sharply focused statement of these difficulties appears in the submission of Arata Isozaki &ampersand; Associates in the recent competition for a broadly sketched Paternoster redevelopment :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X52:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #53:1>
In fact , however , the constraints under which the competitors were required to operate were in one respect less tightly drawn than would have been the case a few years ago .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #54:1>
As recently as 1984 , the City Corporation Planning Commit<l>tee produced a draft plan for future developments which emphasized conserva<l>tion and sought to preserve the existing layout and much of the building stock within the City of London .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #55:1>
This envisaged reanimating traditional areas of small businesses and blocking the drift towards large-scale redevelopment for offices by imposing restrictions on site amalgamation and changes of use .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #56:1>
When the scheme was published , however , it met with considerable opposi<l>tion from City companies and institutions , and from would-be developers who were looking to create large-scale complexes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #57:1>
The background to this opposition was the general euphoria in the money and commodity markets at the expected consequences of &lsquo; Big-Bang &rsquo; - the deregulation in October 1986 of security trading .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #58:1>
The prediction was that broking firms would expand their operations and that very many new com<l>panies would be created .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #59:1>
All of which would increase the demand for City sites and , more importantly , for monumental structures built upon them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #60:1>
The alternative picture of the square mile which &lsquo; Big Bang &rsquo; encouraged is of the Capital of the commercial world block-solid with tall large-plate trading halls and screen-to-screen electronic dealing offices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #61:1>
What , then , was the response of the City planners ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #62:1>
In a word : capitulation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #63:1>
Within eighteen months the Corporation produced a new scheme which con<l>ceded the demands of the markets .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #64:1>
Opportunities for large private develop<l>ments were created by abandoning the protection of the traditional areas of specialist small-scale businesses , by reducing the scope of conservation pro<l>grammes , by no longer requiring coordinated planning on single sites , by increasing plot-ratio allowances and by similar liberalizing measures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #65:1>
The result of this parallel deregulation was as intended .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #66:1>
Shortly thereafter , appli<l>cations were lodged for large single and multi-building developments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #67:1>
Regarding Paternoster , the consortium which early in the same year as the new Corporation report was published had bought most of the leases from the Church ( of England ) Commissioners then sought to avail itself of the opportunity for intensive development by planning to build a million square feet of office space within the 4.3 acre site .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #68:1>
The intention of the original Paternoster Consortium ( the site has since changed ownership ) was that 850,000 square feet of this created space should be devoted to offices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #69:1>
The consequent com<l>petition for a design to these requirements produced the results of which Prince Charles was uniformly critical in the Mansion House speech .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #70:1>
As he then expressed it :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X71:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #72:1>
Here it is neither necessary nor possible for me to consider in any detail the seven competition entries , though some commentary is appropriate since the plans and accompanying texts exhibit features characteristic of the conceptions of architecture favoured by leading professionals but spurned by the general public and some few traditionalists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #73:1>
Having examined the published pro<l>posals , I cannot agree with the Prince that they uniformly neglected the con<l>siderations he mentions , or that they produced wholly inappropriate designs . 8
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #74:1>
I have already commended Isozaki 's acute description of the architect 's task .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #75:1>
It is disappointing , therefore , that the submitted design should fall far short of its clearly stated goal : &lsquo; to discover an architectural form that can accommodate all these functions , activities and contexts at once &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #76:1>
Indeed , I cannot help wonder<l>ing if there is not some recognition of this failure in the minds of the design group .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #77:1>
For whereas the problems are clearly and concisely identified , the language in which their &lsquo; solution &rsquo; is described is inflated , pretentious and often vacuous .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #78:1>
They write :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X79:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X80:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X81:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X82:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #83:1>
The capacity to produce intelligent and perceptive descriptions of works of art and architecture is not unrelated to the ability to create them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #84:1>
Accordingly , no one reading such prose should be surprised if the corresponding &lsquo; rhetoric of urban building design &rsquo; is equally crude and ill-conceived .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #85:1>
This said , the Isozaki scheme is not entirely without merit .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #86:1>
In particular , the varied pattern of incident , interval and allusion is of interest and compares well with the unim<l>aginative and depressing grid plans offered by Foster Associates and by Richard Rogers Partnership , and with the animal-maze cum rural open-prison cum Japanese factory exercise-yard sketched out by MacCormack , Jamieson , Prichard and Wright .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #87:1>
Both Foster and Rogers seem at best insensitive and at worst wilfully unresponsive to the context in which the site is located .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #88:1>
Consider the ways in which they advert to the surrounding historical , architectural and social elements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #89:1>
First Foster :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X90:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X91:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X92:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #93:1>
And now Rogers et al . :
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X94:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X95:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #X96:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #97:1>
Notwithstanding this explicit denial of any positive architectural intentions , they do allow themselves the opportunity to sketch a few utterly familiar city<l->complex type structures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #98:1>
What is yet more depressing is the way in which Rogers and Foster limit the concept of contextual engagement , focusing on flexibility to accommodate changing commercial needs and letting this act as the major constraint on architectural form .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #99:1>
There is no sense at all of a guiding idea seeking incarnation and of a struggle to resolve the functional aspects in accord with this .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #100:1>
Similarly , the interplay with the massive forms of St Paul 's is restricted to limitations of size .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #101:1>
There is simply no attempt to create forms that echo those of Wren 's loquacious oratory , or to convey ideas of any relevance to those broadcast from its fa&ccedille;ade and dome .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #102:1>
Something considerably better in these respects is achieved in the plan proposed by Skidmore , Owings and Merrill who provide views of the Cathedral from framed perspectives within the development and incorporate elements that approximate to some form of architectural continuity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #103:1>
Likewise , Stirling , Wilford and Associates recall earlier city building traditions , if not exactly recreating them , and the proposed loggia screen and cloistered build<l>ings provide an area of mediation between Cathedral and offices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #104:1>
The scheme which won the redevelopment commission , viz. that by Arup Associates , is something of a curate 's egg - good in parts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #105:1>
The most recently published design is a revised version of that originally submitted and bears the marks of adaptation in accord with the preference for traditional styles voiced by the Prince and others .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #106:1>
On the one hand , it promises to preserve the pic<l>turesque perspective of St Paul 's which is a distinctive and much appreciated feature of the existing approach from Ludgate Hill &semi; and the buildings are low-rise , allowing for a roofscape which may yield the impression the Prince envisages of &lsquo; St Paul 's floating like a great ship on the sea &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #107:1>
Likewise , the planned use of Portland stone and the introduction of a colonnaded crescent , garden courtyards and arcades faintly recalls something of the scheme drawn up in 1710 by Hawksmoor , then Wren 's assistant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #108:1>
On the other hand , and notwithstanding an acknowledgement that &lsquo; any development must be subord<l>inate and complementary to the presence of this great building &rsquo; , 12 the design is unmistakably Post-Modernist .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #109:1>
Unlike the official &lsquo; alternative proposal &rsquo; pro<l>duced by John Simpson and Partners which aims at a version of Baroque neo<l>classicism close to that of the eighteenth century , the Arup plan bears the familiar features of late twentieth-century architectural orthodoxies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #110:1>
The con<l>cern with &lsquo; authenticity &rsquo; and &lsquo; integrity &rsquo; expresses itself in , for example , gridded metal-framed canopies in the arcades , supported by steel ( ? ) rods emerging out of free-standing stone pillars &semi; and pole-like , gun-metal columns on the fa&ccedille;ade of the great crescent bounding the Cathedral Close .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #111:1>
In both cases the point is to employ contemporary materials and building techniques and to exhibit this employment in the design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-005 #112:1>
However , the effect of this compromise is uncertainty and confusion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #1:1>
The previous chapter was concerned wholly with the problems of those in charge of England and Wales .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #2:1>
The time has come to consider some of those experienced by the 5 million people whom they ruled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #3:1>
What did they think of the events of 1649-53 ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #4:1>
And how were they affected by them ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #5:1>
To begin to answer these questions it is necessary to under<l>stand the way in which most provincial commoners had re<l>garded the political and social system before the Civil War .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #6:1>
The essential fact was that they had thought it to be a relatively good system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #7:1>
Unlike the other states of its age , the English monarchy had combined a respected national representative body ( Parliament ) with a structure of taxation whereby the rich ( in theory ) paid most , an elaborate machinery of poor relief , and the jury system for trials .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #8:1>
The national Church had enjoyed the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of people , who thought it to be the best in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #9:1>
Thus , even after the Great Civil War had shattered Church and State together and opened some minds to new possibilities , the instincts of the most radical reformers tended towards improving rather than demolishing the political and social structure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #10:1>
Even those who wanted to remove the Church or decentralise power had no plans to alter the institu<l>tions of local government ( which represented government in general to most individuals ) , let alone to redistribute wealth within society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #11:1>
Furthermore , rural commoners in particular were principally concerned with issues such as grain shortages , the use of common land and the encroachment of drainage or disafforestation projects upon traditional rights .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #12:1>
The Great Civil War had afforded them a tremendous opportunity to settle their grievances by taking the law into their own hands when public order broke down .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #13:1>
At many places scattered up and down the country the property of unpopular landowners was attacked , drainage dykes breached and new enclosures levelled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #14:1>
As a result , by 1649 there were not many communities left which harboured acute resentment of their social superiors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #15:1>
The Level<l>lers and the Fifth Monarchists both displayed little understand<l>ing of the world of the countryside .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #16:1>
And within a few months of its accession to power , the Purged Parliament obliged a group of nobles and gentry by empowering them to drain a huge tract of fenland , in flagrant disregard of the wishes of the inhabitants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #17:1>
There were good reasons why the Commonwealth should not have been popular with the English and Welsh in general .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #18:1>
It had raised taxation to record levels and maintained an army which was quartered in the homes of many civilians .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #19:1>
Historians can do no more than guess at the political views of the mass of the population , but every piece of evidence points to the conclusion that most people bitterly regretted the passing of the monarchy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #20:1>
Some indication of this is provided by the runaway success of Eikon Basilike , a volume put out just after the regicide which pur<l>ported to contain the prayers and meditations of the dead King .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #21:1>
It was utterly dishonest compilation , either heavily reworked or actually written by an opportunist clergyman , John Gauden , and perverting the truth of the past to foster the image of Charles I as saint and martyr .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #22:1>
But its mawkish piety caught the public imagination so well that it went into a record thirty-five editions in English ( and twenty-five in foreign tongues ) in one year .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #23:1>
When the Council of State asked John Milton to refute it , he commenced his reply with a recognition that the &lsquo; vulgar audi<l>ence &rsquo; responded easily to the book 's sentiments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #24:1>
His own magni<l>ficent prose clearly did not , for his rebuttal of Eikon never made it to a second edition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #25:1>
Such tests of public political opinion are , however , rare and the historian 's task is not much easier when examining attitudes to the Church under the Commonwealth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #26:1>
One of the avowed aims of the Civil War parliamentarians had been to improve the quality of national religious life , by which they generally meant a more conscientious clergy with a better ability to preach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #27:1>
A negative tactic which they employed to secure this was to eject all clergy whom they considered to be unsatisfactory , among whom they naturally included royalists and confirmed neutralists who were otherwise excellent minis<l>ters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #28:1>
This process was continued under the Commonwealth , with the removal of clergy who preached against the new regime or refused the Engagement to be loyal to it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #29:1>
In Wales the commissioners &lsquo; for the Propagation of the Gospel &rsquo; √≠ , set up by the Purged Parliament , deprived 278 churchmen during the three years of their existence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #30:1>
It was quite impossible for them to find replacements for losses upon this scale , and they resorted to paying preachers stipends to travel around circuits .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #31:1>
We do not know how well this device functioned , or how much satisfaction it gave parishioners .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #32:1>
All that is certain is that , as recounted earlier , it frightened local gentry , and through them the Parlia<l>ment , sufficiently to bring about the end of the scheme .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #33:1>
In total , almost a fifth of the parish clergy of England were permanently deprived of their livings during the Civil War and under the republic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #34:1>
In some counties over a third went , while in Wales a shire such as Anglesey was practically denuded of its familiar ministers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #35:1>
This process would have pleased those parishes where the incumbent had been generally unpopular , but divided or caused widespread distress in others .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #36:1>
The county committees of Parliament which performed the work relied upon information from local people , but too often this was provided by groups within a parish or its own partisans , who were not representative of majority opinion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #37:1>
Many ejected clergymen were reappointed at a later date , but never to their old benefices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #38:1>
Some ministers were paid extra to officiate temporarily in vacant livings , but this proved inadequate to the problem of supplying the places of those who had been evicted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #39:1>
In September 1648 forty parishes were vacant in London , Essex and Hertfordshire .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #40:1>
The villagers of Toft , Cambridgeshire , had to wait six years before getting a new incumbent , and it must be presumed that such cases were as or more common in areas further from the capital .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #41:1>
The par<l>liamentarians had , however , a more positive programme as well : to augment the poorest livings with money taken from former Church revenues and from those of royalists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #42:1>
This work , also , was continued after Pride 's Purge , but from start to finish the funds available for it were never sufficient .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #43:1>
Thus , in Derbyshire 77 livings were augmented between 1645 and 1653 , yet the number which afforded at least the minimum subsistence deemed adequate by the Parliament of 1624 , was only raised to 62 per cent of the whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #44:1>
And in some cases money was not forthcoming to provide even the increases which had been ordered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #45:1>
The Commonwealth 's failure either to impose a framework and a doctrine upon the Church of England or to dismantle it , naturally left all parties dissatisfied , but then it made none desperate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #46:1>
The result was a range of parochial practice deter<l>mined , in different places , by the gentry , the minister or the parishioners .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #47:1>
In some churches the pre-war Prayer Book was certainly read ( illegally , ) though the clergy involved sometimes only used extracts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #48:1>
Others employed the Directory of Worship made mandatory by Parliament in 1645 , to replace the Prayer Book . 5
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #49:1>
In London and Lancashire some parish clergy tried to restrict communion to those whom they considered worthy :
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #50:1>
at Bolton the presbyterian elders issued tickets for this purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #51:1>
There is no evidence for what went on in the great majority of parishes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #52:1>
Control over the presentation of clergy to livings remained very much in the hands of the nobles and gentry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #53:1>
It is true that where the patron had been the Crown , the bishops , the cathedral chapters or a royalist leader , the power of appointment was taken by the same parliamentary committee which dealt with augmentations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #54:1>
But its members generally took advice from local landowners , including royalists , and only occasionally listened to parishioners , or imposed its choice without reference to local views . 6
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #55:1>
From 1646 to 1649 most clergymen entering the Church still went to the deposed bishops for ordination as no alternative means had been clearly established .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #56:1>
It is tempting to say of the Church of the Commonwealth that the lack of direction from above encouraged most parishioners and minis<l>ters to cling as much as possible to pre-Civil War ways .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #57:1>
But the lack of records makes this only an overall impression .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #58:1>
More evidence survives for some of those distinct religious groups which existed either within or without the national ecclesiastical framework .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #59:1>
Least need be said about that which had been the most important before 1642 , the Roman Catholics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #60:1>
Hated by the Civil War parliamentarians both for their faith and for the support which many of them had given to the royalist cause , they had been savagely punished .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #61:1>
Those landed Catholics who had fought for the King lost their estates completely , while those who remained neutral were still deprived of two-thirds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #62:1>
Most had set about recovering their lands by repurchase , but they still had to pay a double share of the national tax upon real estate , and the traditional fines levied upon them for avoiding Protestant worship , levied with a novel stringency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #63:1>
They appeared to be so completely crushed , indeed , that attention was diverted from them for the first time in a century .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #64:1>
Instead , it was drawn to those varieties of Protestant who had formed them<l>selves into pressure-groups .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #65:1>
Two of these accepted the notion of a national Church .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #66:1>
One consisted of the presbyterians , who between 1645 and 1648 had expected to replace the bishops with local classes of clergy and laity whose representatives would determine national policy in synods .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #67:1>
During those years such bodies had been established in London and eleven counties , most of them in the south-east or north-west .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #68:1>
Parliament intended these to be the first of a nationwide system , but it must be noted that twenty-four counties did not even draw up plans for them , suggesting a lack of general enthusiasm for the project .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #69:1>
As soon as Pride 's Purge aborted it , no more classes were set up and those in existence began to lose membership and some to collapse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #70:1>
Nonetheless , in the capital and in Lancashire , Cheshire and Derbyshire , they remained a significant local force .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #71:1>
The other discernible group active within the Church comprised ministers such as John Owen , who were usually called &lsquo; independents &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #72:1>
They wished for a much less stringent definition of orthodoxy than the presby<l>terians , and aimed to level the national body to individual congregations gathered round their ministers , who would meet in national conferences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #73:1>
Their inclination was to limit commun<l>ion , and perhaps worship , to true believers :
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #74:1>
some compromised by forming &lsquo; inner circles &rsquo; of &lsquo; godly &rsquo; parishioners who held additional meetings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #75:1>
Relatively few , and found mainly in south-eastern England , these men wielded considerable influence among the leading army officers and MPs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #76:1>
Outside the Church 's boundaries lay the truly independent congregations , of whose political importance , small numbers and doctrinal divisions something has already been said .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #77:1>
A few were led by ministers who were prepared to let a national system exist but preferred to remain separate from it themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #78:1>
The majority of them rejected the whole idea of a general Church , and their members were nicknamed &lsquo; anabaptists &rsquo; by contempor<l>aries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #79:1>
The name related to the beliefs of the most clearly differentiated sects among them , who reserved baptism to adult believers and were therefore the ancestors of the modern Baptist churches .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #80:1>
They divided in turn over the great question of whether humans in general , or only an elect group of them , could achieve salvation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #81:1>
The adherents of the latter view , the Particular Baptists , had formed regional groupings of congrega<l>tions in the West , the South Midlands , the East Midlands , South Wales and Northumberland by 1653 , but all looked to the churches in London for leadership .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #82:1>
Those who held the former view , the General Baptists , were also strongest in the capital , with groups concentrated in the Fens , Chilterns and Weald of Kent , all areas of weak gentry authority and long traditions of religious heterodoxy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #83:1>
Both sects together had a total of 54 congregations by 1644 , not counting their members in the army , and these multiplied considerably during the next decade .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #84:1>
All were voluntary associations grouped around lay preachers who expounded the Scriptures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #85:1>
They were the best organised of the networks of gathered churches , but there were many other such congregations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #86:1>
Some Baptists were included among the Fifth Monarchists , who were not themselves a sect so much as a set of congregations of differing religious beliefs who endorsed the radical political programme outlined earlier .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #87:1>
In the years 1648-53 there were also , scattered across the country , many small informal groups who rejected the national Church and met to discuss religion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #88:1>
They had no recognised leaders and could hardly be termed congregations or sects at all .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #89:1>
Individuals often wandered between them , seeking ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #90:1>
What all these clusters of people had in common , apart from their hostility to the Church of England , was their social complexion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #91:1>
They were drawn overwhelmingly from artisans and small traders , with a few gentry and merchants and some labourers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #92:1>
Yet to say that they were in any way &lsquo; representative &rsquo; even of craftspeople , would be a gross inaccuracy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #93:1>
The combined strength of the different baptist groups in 1653 was perhaps the equivalent of 1/4 per cent of the national population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #94:1>
They tended to consist of that minority of the &lsquo; middling sorts &rsquo; of society who had lost faith in the old religious ways and were seriously worried about their personal salvation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-006 #95:1>
What their social and economic position afforded was an opportunity to be more exposed to new ideas than those below them and less worried about the importance of hierarchy than those above .

Narrative Theories and Legal Discourse
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #3:1>
BERNARD S. JACKSON
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #4:1>
Introduction
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #5:1>
Narrative models of different kinds have been used in and around legal studies for a number of different purposes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #6:1>
Lawyers have used them , for example , to justify some of the inferential processes of fact-finding in court , while social scientists have used them in a descriptive account of the processes of construction of truth by the jury .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #7:1>
Lawyers have also begun to study the rhetorical implica<l>tions of the presentation of facts by judges in their published judgments , and have noted particularly the relationship between fact and law which is implicit in that practice .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #8:1>
Psychologists have considered the role of narrative in the operation of memory and other psychological processes - an issue clearly important for our assessment of the construction of legal facts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #9:1>
Some semiotic approaches , notably that of Greimas , place considerable impor<l>tance upon narrative in the deep structure of signification of any form of discourse &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #10:1>
this approach , too , has been applied to legal discourse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #11:1>
In this chapter , I first review these various uses of narrative in the legal context , and then offer my own recipe for their inter<l>relationship .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #12:1>
It is a recipe which adopts semiotics as its overall conceptual structure , and which in so doing endorses a Saussurian-based semiotics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #13:1>
By using this recipe , I seek to achieve an integrated model of legal processes : one which , through its emphasis upon the narrative construction of the pragmatic as well as the semantic dimension of legal discourse , is able to offer parallel accounts of the construction and of the justification of facts , and of the construction and justification of law within ( and outside ) the processes of the courtroom . 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #14:1>
While more traditional accounts stress ( or presuppose ) the difference between &lsquo; fact &rsquo; and &lsquo; law &rsquo; , my approach attaches greater importance to the distinction between the often unconscious processes of decision-making on the one hand and the explicit rationality of the justification of decisions on the other 2 - whether those decisions concern fact or law .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #15:1>
Narrative in the Rhetorical Presentation of a Case
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #16:1>
Twining , in a recently completed book , 3 considers a view some<l>times expressed by practising advocates , and endorsed by some American realists , that the statement of facts can often be formu<l>lated so as to advance a particular legal argument :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #17:1>
&lsquo; The statement of facts is the heart of the case . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #18:1>
He offers as an example the opening passage of Lord Denning 's judgment in the case of Miller v. Jackson .

<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #48:1>
Twining notes that this example of the presentation of facts by a judge is sometimes regarded as extreme , or &lsquo; in some undefined way unjudge-like &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #49:1>
It seems to be arguing a case , &lsquo; in favour of cricket , against the Millers personally , or against property developers , or private property &rsquo; , 5 rather than merely to provide a neutral descrip<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #50:1>
To my mind , what is interesting is the manner in which the rhetoric is expressed in a narrative form .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #51:1>
There is a picture of a community bonded together by this common interest :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #52:1>
in summer , they all go and enjoy the cricket .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #53:1>
Cricket even unites the young and old ( an oppositional pair within which conflict is often expected ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #54:1>
In Lintz , the villagers are so wedded to cricket that they have actually purchased their own ground , and have looked after it with love and attention .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #55:1>
This is not a bias in favour of &lsquo; cricket &rsquo; in the abstract , but rather in favour of the traditional playing of cricket , with all the associations which its narrativization presents .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #56:1>
These value-laden associations are not legally relevant , yet they are inextricable from the narrative understanding of the situation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #57:1>
This first narrative ( of traditional cricket-playing ) is then put into a wider narrative framework .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #58:1>
The fact that the villagers have always ( or at least for seventy years ) played cricket on this site implies that they want ( and are entitled ) to continue to do so . 6
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #59:1>
But along comes an opponent , &lsquo; a newcomer who is no lover of cricket &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #60:1>
We have immediately the narrative framework of an outsider who comes along and tries to interfere with traditional practices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #61:1>
This comes laden with social disapproval .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #62:1>
Not only that .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #63:1>
The outsider gets &lsquo; a Judge of the High Court &rsquo; to order them to stop playing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #64:1>
Another &lsquo; disapproved &rsquo; narrative is here introduced : the person in authority who interferes with the traditional pleasures of the people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #65:1>
More<l>over , the effect of the judge 's order might well prove socially detrimental :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #66:1>
Lord Denning conjures up a narrative of young men , deprived of their traditional pursuits , who turn to violence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #67:1>
All this , of course , is &lsquo; factual &rsquo; description .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #68:1>
But then , the coup de gr‚Äöce : &lsquo; And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #69:1>
This refers obliquely ( and disapprov<l>ingly ) to the legal rule that it is no defence that the plaintiff &lsquo; came to the nuisance &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #70:1>
Here , the activity existed before the Millers arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #71:1>
They had the choice not to buy a property affected in that way .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #72:1>
Lord Denning has clothed his opposition to the application of the legal rule in a vivid , narrative presentation of the facts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #73:1>
The effectiveness of that strategy of persuasion is attested by its recur<l>rent use from ancient 7 to modern times. 8
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #74:1>
In discussing this passage I have sought to identify only those underlying narrative frameworks which appear to have affected Lord Denning 's decision as to the proper rule to apply .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #75:1>
There are many other features of the passage which are worthy of attention ( such as the relative lack of interest in the background of the Millers - &lsquo; This newcomer has built , or has had built for him &rsquo; - as compared to that of the cricketers ) which contribute , at the rhetorical level , to the justifiability of the conclusion , albeit in non-legal terms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #76:1>
In the event , this persuasion was - at least in terms of the narrative structure here presented - successful :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #77:1>
the outcome of the case was that the order of the High Court judge was reversed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #78:1>
The cricket club was allowed to continue - although with a require<l>ment to compensate if the cricket balls caused damage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #79:1>
The reason why the judgment stands out as unusual , and - to Twining and some of his students - &lsquo; deviant &rsquo; , is because Lord Denning appears here to have misjudged , according to the conven<l>tions of at least these types of audience , the dividing line between those factors in decision-making which conventionally remain private , and those which may be used publicly in the processes of justification .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #80:1>
That dividing line is imposed to a large extent by the content of rules of law :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #81:1>
it is the content of the substantive rules which determines &lsquo; relevance &rsquo; ( &lsquo; relevance &rsquo; , of course , as understood for legal purposes ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #82:1>
Where the judge does stray , in his presentation of the facts , from those issues which the law regards as relevant , we may reasonably hypothesize that he is giving an account of ( some of ) those non-legal factors which have actually influenced his decision-making .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #83:1>
This is one part of the answer to an obvious methodological difficulty :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #84:1>
if the judgment is a justificatory discourse , how can we use it to provide evidence of the anterior processes of decision-making ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #85:1>
Judicial discourse , I suggest , leaves traces of decision-making to the extent that it is &lsquo; deviant &rsquo; √≠ , and breaches conventions as to what may legitimately be said within justificatory discourse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #86:1>
But this is not our only resource for the detection of decision-making .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #87:1>
Even where the facts recounted are limited to those which are &lsquo; relevant &rsquo; in terms of the legal rules , 9 we may still have recourse to the rhetorical construction of the narrative .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #88:1>
For though the law may define that which is relevant , it cannot define how the relevant facts , in a particular case , are to be expressed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #89:1>
Nor can the judge 's presentation of the facts ever be entirely neutral .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #90:1>
It reflects by its inclusions and exclusions , the emphases of its sentence construction , and the structures of its argumentation - choices which , precisely because they are deployed spontaneously in the act of writing , may well be relevant to the subconscious , decision-making level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #91:1>
Narrative and the Assessment of Probabilities
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #92:1>
Neil MacCormick has offered a conception of &lsquo; narrative coherence &rsquo; as &lsquo; a test of truth or probability in questions of fact and evidence upon which direct proof by immediate observation is unavail<l>able &rsquo; . 10
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #93:1>
He compares detective fiction , as exemplified by the Sherlock Holmes stories :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #94:1>
the reason something strikes us as plaus<l>ible in literature , and equally in life , is that &lsquo; we treat the natural world as explicable in terms of explanatory principles ( &ldquo; laws &rdquo; ) of a causal and probabilistic kind , and the world of human affairs as explicable in terms of explanatory principles of a rational , intentional and motivational as well as a causal and probabilistic kind &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #95:1>
That narrative coherence , for MacCormick , comes into play only in the absence of truth based upon observation ( and communicated through referential language ) is well illustrated by his account of the difficulty in the notorious Edinburgh murder case of Burke and Hare :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #X96:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #X97:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #X98:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #X99:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #100:1>
If coherence comes into play only when direct observation stops , it also falls short , for MacCormick , of providing a sufficient means of assessing possible inferences from the observed facts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #101:1>
What it provides is no more than one or more coherent theories .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #102:1>
In order to assess the relative weight of such theories , he suggests , we must hand over to the analyst of probabilities . 12
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #103:1>
At the end of the day MacCormick is apparently not satisfied by the commonsensical status of narrative coherence &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #104:1>
he seeks , at the least , to validate narrative coherence through recourse to a more specific form of justificatory discourse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #105:1>
Narrative and Plausibility :
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #106:1>
The Modern Jury Trial
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #107:1>
It is a mistake , I would suggest , to limit the role of &lsquo; narrative coherence &rsquo; to the assessment of inferences from direct testimony .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #108:1>
At least as important is the assessment of the truth-claims of that direct testimony itself .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #109:1>
While paying substantial attention to different types of inference , Bennett and Feldman apply narrative models to the assessment both of direct evidence ( that which the witness claims personally to have observed ) and of inferences which the jury is invited to draw from such direct evidence . 13
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #110:1>
Taking their inspiration from frame analysis in sociology , they sought to test a hypothesis derived from their observations of jury trials , combined with discussions with participants , through the use of social-psychological experimentation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #111:1>
Their hypothesis was that the construction of truth within the courtroom was primarily a matter of the overall narrative plausibility of the story told .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #112:1>
They argue that it is not the weighing of individual elements of the story , each in terms of the evidence for that element , which renders a case persuasive or not , but rather the plausibility of the story structure taken as a whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #113:1>
One argu<l>ment for this lies in the fact that several different witnesses are called to construct a single story .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #114:1>
&lsquo; In the end , &rsquo; they argue , &lsquo; it is the fit of the symbolised element into the larger structure , and not the pure documentation for the element itself , that dictates final judgment ...
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #115:1>
alternative definitions are available for virtually any fact or bit of evidence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #116:1>
Once again , the key issue is how the chosen definition fits within the competing accounts of the incident &rsquo; ( Bennett and Feldman 1981 : I l3ff . ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #117:1>
In order to test this , they set up an experiment within which two groups of undergraduates told stories to the rest of the class , the one group telling true stories ( involving themselves ) , the other group telling false stories ( also involving themselves ) , and the audience rating the truth of each story .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #118:1>
They then determined whether audience judgments varied independently of the truth status of the story , by comparing audience guesses to each story<l>teller 's claim about his or her story .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #119:1>
The stories were scored for ambiguities by each author , and 80 per cent agreement on all the various aspects of the coding task was achieved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #120:1>
Their results indicated no statistical association between the actual truth status of stories and their perceived truth status .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #121:1>
Moreover , they found that the structure of a story had a considerable impact on its credibility &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #122:1>
as structural ambiguities in stories increased , credibility decreased , and vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #123:1>
Bennett and Feldman claim , in effect , that judgements as to truth are based upon comparison with common-sense knowledge , and that this knowledge is itself constructed as narrative .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #124:1>
But we must distinguish ( perhaps more clearly than Bennett and Feldman do ) between narrative structures on the one hand and substantive narrative typifications of behaviour on the other .
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #125:1>
Narrative struc<l>tures are of understanding which allow us to recognize discourse presented to us as an intelligible story &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #126:1>
it has much in common , in this respect , with &lsquo; story grammar &rsquo; as developed by some social psychologists , 14 and indeed with the syntagmatic level of the &lsquo; deep structures of signification &rsquo; of Greimasian semiotics.
<ICE-GB:W2A-007 #127:1>
Bennett and Feldman present an account of narrative structure in terms of setting , concern , central action , and resolution :

CAROLINGIAN UNCIAL :
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #2:1>
A CONTEXT FOR THE LOTHAR PSALTER
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #3:1>
ROSAMOND McKITTERICK
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #4:1>
IN his famous identification and dating of the Morgan Golden Gospels published in the Festschrift for Belle da Costa Greene , E.A. Lowe was quite explicit in his categorizing of Carolingian uncial as the &lsquo; invention of a display artist &rsquo; . 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #5:1>
He went on to define it as an artificial script beginning to be found in manuscripts of the ninth century and even of the late eighth century .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #6:1>
These uncials were reserved for special display purposes , for headings , titles , colophons , opening lines and , exceptionally , as in the case of the Morgan Gospels Lowe was discussing , for an entire codex .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #7:1>
Lowe acknowledged that uncial had been used in these ways before the end of the eighth century , but then it was &lsquo; natural &rsquo; not &lsquo; artificial &rsquo; uncial .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #8:1>
One of the problems I wish to address is the degree to which Frankish uncial in the late eighth and the ninth centuries is indeed &lsquo; artificial &rsquo; rather than &lsquo; natural &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #9:1>
Can it be regarded as a deliberate recreation of a script type , or is it a refinement and elevation in status of an existing book script ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #10:1>
Secondly , to what degree is a particular script type used for a particular text type in the early Middle Ages ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #11:1>
The third problem , related at least to the first , if not to the second , is whether Frankish uncial , be it natural or artificial , is sufficiently distinctive when used by a particular scriptorium to enable us to locate a manuscript or fragment to one atelier rather than another .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #12:1>
This problem needs , of course , to be set within the context of later Carolingian book production , the notions of &lsquo; house &rsquo; style as opposed to &lsquo; regional &rsquo; style and the criteria for locating manuscript production to particular scriptoria in the Frankish kingdoms under the Carolingians that I have discussed elsewhere . 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #13:1>
It is also of particular importance when considering the Hofschule ateliers of the mid-ninth century associated with the Emperor Lothar and with King Charles the Bald .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #14:1>
Did they develop &lsquo; house styles &rsquo; of either minuscule or uncial , and can manuscripts written in high-grade scripts of the Carolingian period be linked palaeographically without the aid of minuscule ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #15:1>
The discussion is particularly pertinent in relation to a fragment of a hitherto unlocated Gospel Book of the mid-ninth century , written in an uncial script of great elegance and beauty , of which I shall have more to say at the end of this paper .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #16:1>
To tackle the question of natural versus artificial uncial one needs to consider the history of uncial script in early mediaeval Europe and its differentiation into &lsquo; national &rsquo; types .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #17:1>
Uncial was a book hand which became increasingly common in the course of the fourth century and which , according to Lowe , reached perfection in the fifth . 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #18:1>
An early example is the fourth-century Livy &semi; 4
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #19:1>
other typical perfected uncial scripts are those of the Victor Codex in Fulda , written in South Italy in A.D. 546 , or the Burchard Gospels , now in W&uumlaut;rzburg , also written , according to Lowe , &lsquo; doubtless in Italy &rsquo; . 5
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #20:1>
What gives it its &lsquo; peculiar grace and beauty &rsquo; is the emphasis on curved strokes , particularly to be noted in the forms of the &lsquo; a &rsquo; , &lsquo; d &rsquo; , &lsquo; e &rsquo; , &lsquo; h &rsquo; , &lsquo; m &rsquo; and &lsquo; u &rsquo; ( fig. I ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #21:1>
Distinctive &lsquo; national types &rsquo; of uncial developed in the course of the early Middle Ages throughout Western Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #22:1>
Quite apart from &lsquo; English uncial &rsquo; which has been fully documented , 6 there is also a type of &lsquo; Frankish uncial &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #23:1>
Indeed , far from there being a hiatus in the evolution of uncial script in the Frankish kingdoms , still less a period of decadence , there was an essential continuity in the development of uncial script in the Frankish kingdoms which culminated in Carolingian uncial .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #24:1>
Jouarre and Chelles in the first half of the eighth century were the most productive and influential centres &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #25:1>
the uncial script they produced was refined and given the forms in which it can be recognized as the ancestor of the elegant Carolingian uncials of the next century . 8
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #26:1>
Yet theirs are also forms clearly related to the distinctive Frankish uncial types that one can observe in the manuscripts from Merovingian Gaul in the seventh and eighth centuries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #27:1>
In other words there is a direct continuity traceable in the letter forms of Frankish uncial from the fifth century through to the ninth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #28:1>
From the point of view of the development of script , Frankish uncial in the Carolingian period cannot be labelled an artificial development .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #29:1>
It is a natural one .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #30:1>
The definition Lowe offered of Carolingian uncial as an &lsquo; artificial script &rsquo; , therefore , on the basis of analysis of the development of the letter forms , cannot be sustained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #31:1>
If there is no abrupt change , but rather a gradual transformation , in uncial letter forms , it is perhaps in the use of uncial that a break or change is to be observed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #32:1>
It is important to note that in the early stages of its history uncial appears to have been associated with Christian texts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #33:1>
Choices of types of script for particular purposes , indeed , had been made throughout the Roman period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #34:1>
Surviving evidence suggests a preference for capitals , whether square or rustic , for non-Christian texts , and uncial for Christian writings in the fourth century , just as the codex appears to have been the Christians ' preferred format for the book . 9
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #35:1>
Lawyers and notaries on the other hand , as well as private letter-writers , preferred the cursive forms , and the former in particular developed their own distinctive shorthand - tironian notes - as part of the technical writing of their professions. 10
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #36:1>
Different letter forms , therefore , were recognized as suitable or appropriate for different purposes in the late Roman world .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #37:1>
As far as uncial is concerned , moreover , it was joined as a book hand at a very early stage by half uncial ( and do not let us forget the still lower ranking &lsquo; quarter uncial &rsquo; ! ) . 11
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #38:1>
There seems little doubt that this was a differentiation according to formality and rank of script .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #39:1>
Use of uncial to provide headings in half-uncial codices of the sixth and seventh centuries seems to me to reinforce an understanding of uncial as a high-grade script from the very beginning of its existence and one that in principle at least would be reserved for special books .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #40:1>
Of the 138 Gospel Books recorded in McGurk 's handlist , for example , apart from those written in insular half-uncial , itself a high-ranking script , only sixteen are not written in uncial script .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #41:1>
Half of these were written at the end of the eighth century or in the early ninth and may represent deliberate choices for one reason or another ( including delight in experimenting with the new minuscule , for two - Trier 22 and Cotton Claudius B.V - come from the court school of Charlemagne ) . 12
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #42:1>
The remainder seem to represent departures from a norm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #43:1>
The two earliest , the Aberdeen fragment written in rustic capitals and the St Gall Vulgate in half-uncials , may have been written at a time when the hierarchy of appropriate scripts was being worked out . 13
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #44:1>
The others constitute interesting exceptions to uncial being a standard script for Gospel Books on the Continent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #45:1>
Two sixth-century Gospel Books , Karlsruhe Landesbibliothek Aug.fragm. 14 and the Split Chapter Library Gospels , were written in half uncial . 14
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #46:1>
An eighth-century example of a half-uncial Gospel Book is Leningrad O.v.I. 2 , from Corbie . 15
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #47:1>
The other three eighth-century Gospels are written in minuscule .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #48:1>
Berne 199 is a fragment of St John 's Gospel written in eastern France in pre-Caroline minuscule . 16
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #49:1>
Leningrad O.v.I.3 , possibly from Corbie , is written in Merovingian cursive . 17
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #50:1>
Montpellier 3 was written in b-minuscule in the second half of the eighth century and is among those from the Jouarre-Chelles constellation I mentioned earlier . 18
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #51:1>
N-uncial is used for the headings in Montpellier 3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #52:1>
These examples of the use of scripts other than uncial towards the end of the eighth century are indications that uncial was beginning to go out of use as the exclusive book hand for this kind of text .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #53:1>
In view of the number of ninth-century Gospel Books of a grand format preserving uncial for the text from the early ninth century , however , ( such as the Lorsch Gospels ) , and its continued appearance in the grander Gospel Books of the later ninth century ( such as the Gospels written for Lothar or Charles the Bald ) , it by no means went totally out of use .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #54:1>
With regard to Sacramentaries the evidence is less conclusive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #55:1>
Of the forty-four Sacramentaries recorded by Delisle dating to before the tenth century , only eleven date to before the ninth , but these , with the exception of the anomalous Bobbio Missal , were written in uncial . 19
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #56:1>
Thereafter it appears only to be the very grandest of Sacramentaries that would use uncial for portions of the text other than headings and titles , such as the Drogo Sacramentary , BN lat. 9428 , some of the group of Sacramentaries produced at St Amand for export and on commission in the second half of the ninth century such as Stockholm MS.fr. I , Pierpont Morgan G 57 and BN lat. 2290 , and the Metz Sacramentary produced by the court school of Charles the Bald .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #57:1>
Again , however , there is at least an indication of the high status of uncial in that it appears in prefaces and in the central canon of the Mass when it is used as a text hand , and there is no reason to posit a major hiatus in the use of the script in Mass Books . 20
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #58:1>
What of the other books produced in Frankish Gaul in the pre-Carolingian period ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #59:1>
Is there a clear differentiation in script type in relation to text type ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #60:1>
The answer would appear to be not at all .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #61:1>
There is an enormous variety of texts written in uncial extant from the period before the middle of the eighth century .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #62:1>
There are Roman and canon law , the works of Gregory the Great , Augustine , Jerome , Isidore , Julianus Pomerius , Ambrose , Lactantius , Cyprian , Origen , Paterius , Eucherius , Iuvencus and Hilary , as well as Ovid , Livy , Pliny , Probus , grammatical texts , poetry , medical texts , Eusebius and Fredegar . 21
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #63:1>
These range in date from the fifth to the mid-eighth century , but there are far more manuscripts produced in the eighth century generally than in the two preceding centuries , and this may not just be an unfortunate pattern of survival .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #64:1>
The books produced in the eighth century , moreover , appear to be exactly the same kind of text as in those produced in half-uncial , though in books of a larger and somewhat more sumptuous format .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #65:1>
They raise the question of whether the use of a particular type of script outside the special category of Gospels might depend as much on the wealth of the commissioner or producer of the book as on the type of text it contained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #66:1>
Uncial could have been not only a higher-grade script but also a more highly paid one , requiring greater skill and special training . 22
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #67:1>
Conversely , the mass of books written in the standard grade , minuscule , may represent a widening of the market for cheaper books . 23
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #68:1>
If one surveys the Frankish manuscripts produced in the first half-century of Carolingian rule , that is , between the mid-eighth century and the beginning of the ninth there is a quite remarkable change in emphasis in script types .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #69:1>
Uncial as a text hand is hardly in evidence at all as the main text hand in books .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #70:1>
Apart from the Gospel books , uncial is only to be seen in the Anthologia Latina in BN lat. 10318 , 24 the North French Psalter in BN lat. 13159 ( 795-800 ) 25 and the fragment of a homiliary possibly from Bavaria and now in Bamberg ( Stadtsarchiv fragm. 43 ) , 26 some canon law ( BN lat. 281 + lat. 298 ) 27 and some medical texts ( BN lat.n.a.lat. 203 ) from southern France or perhaps northern Italy and one or two others . 28
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #71:1>
What we are witnessing is a major script revolution , in which a conscious choice of script type appears to have been made for a variety of reasons , not all of which are as yet understood . 29
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #72:1>
Uncial was elevated in status , and minuscule took the place of both uncial and half uncial as the normal text hand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-008 #73:1>
Uncial is preserved for titles , prefaces , headings , opening pages and the like , but we now only find it as a text hand in the most glorious of books destined for the wealthiest of patrons .

<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #1:1>
&lsquo; Where are the war-poets ? &rsquo; asked Day Lewis in 1943 . 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #2:1>
It was an inevitably ironic question .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #3:1>
The 1914-18 war destroyed the ideal of the heroic warrior , but it also established a particular role for the soldier-writer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #4:1>
There could be no Rupert Brooke in 1940 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #5:1>
Another tradition over the previous twenty years had displaced that of the celebratory and conformist war-writer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #6:1>
The soldier-writer was now both a heroic and an anti-heroic figure &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #7:1>
the unambiguous position of the &lsquo; public &rsquo; poets of 1914 - Bridges , Newbolt , Hardy , Kipling , Watson , Phillips - was scarcely possible in the Second World War .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #8:1>
The disintegration of the soldier 's heroic status involved a re<l->evaluation of the writer 's role and authority .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #9:1>
HEROIC LITERATURE IN THE GREAT WAR
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #10:1>
In the first edition of Punch during the war , a short story by A.A. Milne satirises military commanders and foretells of 100,000 dead ( pretty well the size of the BEF then being mobilised ) . 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #11:1>
It was , from the magazine 's point of view , an unfortunate story in a generally unfortunate issue :
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #12:1>
the magazine had gone to press several days earlier and found itself outmoded by the diplomatic events of early August .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #13:1>
The following issue soon righted affairs and Punch , under its editor Owen Seaman , became an illiberal supporter of the war effort .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #14:1>
It celebrated the end of the war with a more conventional and less realistic image : a full-page cartoon showing Haig , on horseback &agrave; la Wellington , receiving the acclaim of his infantry. 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #15:1>
One of the more remarkable things about the home front during the war was its ability to sustain for four years an image of warfare so pictorially distant from the reality whose literal distance would have been negligible were it not for the Channel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #16:1>
It is even more remarkable given the vast amount of prewar literature , in the form of invasion stories , which sought to establish in the public 's mind the likely horrors of occupation by an enemy army : amoral warfare &semi; arbitrary shootings of civilians &semi; and battlefields like slaughter-houses .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #17:1>
All of these are to be found , for instance , in W. Douglas Newton 's novel War , published just before the war broke out , but this was merely one of the last in a long series of works - drama , fiction and verse - going back to Sir George Chesney 's Battle of Dorking ( 1871 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #18:1>
Most of these works conceived of some future &lsquo; great &rsquo; war with ( usually ) Germany &semi; and their conception was of advanced technology , deliberate atrocity and scientific militarism. 4
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #19:1>
When the war did break out , such images were not so much forgotten - it was soon termed the Great War - as distorted by propagandist caricature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #20:1>
Whereas Germany was seen to personify victory at all costs , Britain 's war effort was pictured in archaic , chivalric images made readily available by the Victorians ' medieval revival and its popularisation in the didactic literature of social heroism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #21:1>
The moral issue in August 1914 seemed as clear as a Raemaekers cartoon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #22:1>
The home front 's understanding of the war was filtered through literary and pictorial images which varied in origin from official propaganda to individual enthusiasm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #23:1>
These images came mainly from poems , novels , articles , cartoons , postcards , films and post<l>ers , which on the whole depicted warfare sentimentally and emphasised the social nature of heroism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #24:1>
It is not true that this constituted the sum total of literary and artistic Britain in 1914-18 , but it was the most likely civilian way of comprehending the war .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #25:1>
John Brophy , later a war novelist , was to say of the war years :
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #26:1>
There were , of course , exceptions to this .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #27:1>
Sassoon published two volumes of satirical and indignant war poetry in 1917-18 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #28:1>
There was also from the start a small but continuous vein of writing directed against aspects of the war effort or the war itself . 6
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #29:1>
And some writing remains more than a historical curiosity , such as Wells 's account of troubled liberalism in Mr Britling Sees It Through or Hugh Walpole 's evocative picture of the Eastern Front in The Dark Forest ( both 1916 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #30:1>
Nevertheless , civilian society was largely fed on a diet of heroic stories and atrocity tales .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #31:1>
The literary celebration of heroism continued the tradition of redemptive suffering and action so beloved by writers of parlour poetry and Sunday School storybooks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #32:1>
The ne'er-do-well who is transformed in Flanders is the subject of a host of verse and prose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #33:1>
John Buchan made him &lsquo; King of Ypres &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #34:1>
Donald Hankey wrote about him for the Spectator . 7
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #35:1>
R.W. Campbell , a Boer War veteran , makes him the title-hero of Private Spud Tamson ( 1915 ) , promoted to sergeant in the next volume ( 1918 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #36:1>
Many even more minor versions of him abound in journals and newspapers , revealing &lsquo; the tremendous amount of heroism that lay latent in the commonplace lads &rsquo; . 8
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #37:1>
Some went further , turning Tommy into a Christ-figure ( a comparison that was to be used by both supporters and critics of the war ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #38:1>
The most popular example was probably that of John Oxenham , easily the best-selling poet of the war , who had no doubt that the soldiers were &lsquo; Christs All &rsquo; . 9
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #39:1>
The enlistment of Kitchener 's Army encouraged stories which showed what an adventure war could be .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #40:1>
Ruby Ayres 's Richard Chatterton V.C. ( 1915 ) is a variant of Mason 's The Four Feathers &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #41:1>
Cicely Hamilton 's hero in William - An Englishman ( 1919 ) redeems not his cowardice but his prewar socialism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #42:1>
Escott Lynn and William Le Queux continued their adventure stories but with a war setting .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #43:1>
Le Queux had written a prewar scare story , The Invasion of 1910 , which had been serialised by Harmondsworth in 1906 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #44:1>
At the Sign of the Sword ( 1915 ) combines romance with atrocity propagan<l>da .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #45:1>
Lynn 's prewar success had been as a light historical novelist &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #46:1>
he employed similar fanciful ideas in his war novels - In Khaki for the King ( 1915 ) , Oliver Hastings V.C. ( 1916 ) and Knights of the Air ( 1918 ) - and sustained them briefly after the war in Tommy of the Tanks ( 1919 ) and Lads of the Lothians ( 1920 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #47:1>
Joseph Hocking 's war novels 10 are also dominated by romance and adventure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #48:1>
His heroes are naturally decent , brave and honest &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #49:1>
they are used to voice their author 's belief in a Christian war and his spleen against pacifists and shirkers ( Hocking was a Wesleyan clergyman whose son was to be killed on active service in 1918 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #50:1>
One particular quality in the model Englishman was especially emphasised : his playing for others .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #51:1>
Team games are a ubiquitous motif in the visual and verbal propaganda of the war &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #52:1>
they were a part of a widely held self-image of England as a fair nation with an amateur 's approach to war ( amateur not being a pejorative term , except in the case of right-wing critics such as Kipling ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #53:1>
Although this may have been a valid way of comprehending the war - and for many volunteers it was - it left behind a view of war no more accurate of the Western Front than a Morris romance was of a medieval battle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #54:1>
The imagery of team games and medievalism often went together .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #55:1>
One of the earliest pieces of fiction about the war , Arthur Machen 's &lsquo; The Bowmen &rsquo; in which the spirits of St George and his archers repel a German attack , was popular enough to have been believed ( because of or despite Machen 's reputation as a writer about the supernatural ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #56:1>
indeed , it was considerably embellished . 11
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #57:1>
Other writers , too , resorted to chival<l>ric romance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #58:1>
One bestseller was The Love of an Unknown Soldier ( published anonymously but actually by Coningsby Dawson , who was a serving soldier at the time ) . 12
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #59:1>
The book is a series of letters purportedly written but not sent by a modern Arthurian officer &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #60:1>
the last letter is melodramatically incomplete :
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #61:1>
the enemy are rapidly encroaching .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #62:1>
In Arthur Fetterless 's Gog : The Story of an Officer and Gentleman ( 1916 ) , the young hero has his story told under such headings as &lsquo; The Knight &rsquo; , &lsquo; Setting Forth &rsquo; and &lsquo; The Hour of Trial &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #63:1>
More sophisticated is John Masefield 's Gallipoli ( 1916 ) , written in response to American criticisms of the Dar<l>danelles campaign and stemming from Masefield 's time on a hospital ship at Gallipoli .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #64:1>
The book makes fanciful analogies with The Song of Roland &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #65:1>
it is hard to accept their conviction or Masefield 's unqualified admiration for Hamilton , literary dilettante and commander in charge of the campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #66:1>
While sporting metaphors and chivalric euphemisms delineated the social nature of heroic action , other accounts conceived of the fighting in naively comprehensible terms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #67:1>
The reader of Henry Newbolt 's Tales of War ( 1916 ) would easily recognise the strategical value of the incidents related &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #68:1>
trench warfare also makes sense in Buchan 's The Battle of the Somme : the First Phase ( 1916 ) , written from the viewpoint of someone who joined Haig 's staff in September 1916 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #69:1>
Unsurprisingly , the home front was kept ignorant of the reality .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #70:1>
Soldiers were reticent &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #71:1>
journalism had to pass the censor &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #72:1>
the famous war films faked frontline scenes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #73:1>
Propaganda could hardly insist that troops suffered anonymous death &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #74:1>
better to imagine , as the alliterative author of Aunt Sarah and the War did , &lsquo; each dying in doing a voluntary deed of daring &rsquo; . 13
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #75:1>
One example of the home front 's clinging to an antiquated idea of war occurs in late 1917 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #76:1>
The British Army was then engaged in the huge Passchendaele offensive , but on 31 October a number of papers carried verse extolling the exploits of the small BEF who in 1914 had resisted the numerically superior German Army .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #77:1>
On 15 December a choral commemoration of the First Seven Divisions took place at the Albert Hall .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #78:1>
The image of a small heroic army , defiant like the Spartans at Thermopylae , was easier to celebrate than the reality of contemporary Flanders . 14
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #79:1>
Many schoolboy stories worked the war into a recognisable Henty tradition , most notably Captain ( later Lieutenant-Colonel ) Brereton , whose series of novels from Under French 's Command ( 1915 ) to With the Allies on the Rhine ( 1919 ) sustains a saga of heroic achievement . 15
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #80:1>
D.H. Parry ( 1917 ) and Herbert Strang ( 1918 ) both wrote adventures With Haig on the Somme &semi; no one seems to have managed With Plumer at Passchendaele .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #81:1>
There were more convincing kinds of propagandist literature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #82:1>
Perhaps the most famous was Ian Hay 's The First Hundred Thousand ( 1915 ) , a good-humoured account of an amateur army turning professional .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #83:1>
However , its sentimental humour and gentle satire are already losing their charm by the time Hay describes frontline action .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #84:1>
Clich&eacute;s such as &lsquo; grim realities &rsquo; hide more mischief than they reveal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #85:1>
This was deliberately so &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #86:1>
Hay had seen enough of war to win the MC and his book was intended to sustain morale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #87:1>
Carrying On - After the First Hundred Thousand ( 1917 ) sustains the &lsquo; greater game &rsquo; imagery , taking the story up to the unit 's &lsquo; profitable parti<l>cipation in the Somme &rsquo; ( p. vii ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #88:1>
A more brutalised hero emerges in the short stories of &lsquo; Sapper &rsquo; ( H.C. McNeile ) , a regular soldier with the Royal Engineers ( &lsquo; Sap<l>pers &rsquo; ) , who began writing during the war .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #89:1>
His stories portray a violence which sometimes seems at odds with euphemistic prop<l>aganda :
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #90:1>
a lieutenant murders surrendering Germans &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #91:1>
a staff officer shoots a Tommy to prevent panic . 16
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #92:1>
Yet this violence , too , is within a popular moralistic tradition &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #93:1>
and &lsquo; Sapper &rsquo; remains an uncompli<l>cated propagandist , revelling in enemy atrocity story and extolling British fair play .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #94:1>
His didactic violence and nationalist caricatures were sustained in the postwar adventures of Bulldog Drummond .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #95:1>
Propaganda could admit even more degrees of realism &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #96:1>
it was a question of how that realism was handled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #97:1>
Bairnsfather 's cartoons were safely comic &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #98:1>
Caton-Woodville 's pictures of blinded soldiers were sentimental &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #99:1>
Sassoon 's poem &lsquo; The Rear-guard &rsquo; is harmless when it appears in E.B. Osborn 's unduly uplifting anthology The Muse in Arms ( 1917 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #100:1>
Indeed , realism is not by nature anti-heroic , as is clear from the sculpture of Charles Sargeant Jagger .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #101:1>
It was irony , dissent and satire , as in Nevinson 's censored picture &lsquo; Paths of Glory &rsquo; , which were to be kept out and on the whole were .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #102:1>
Generally , the cult of heroes in the war was naive because popular tradition , propaganda and ignorance made it so .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #103:1>
Certain individuals achieved hero-worship &semi; some of them , such as Roberts , Kitchener or Rupert Brooke , dying not very noticeably heroic deaths &semi; some of them , such as Edith Cavell and Jack Cornwall , dying through gallantry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-009 #104:1>
Their common link was that their heroism resided in social duty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #1:1>
6 Anglo-French Conflict
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #2:1>
6.1 The Causes of War in 1294
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #3:1>
Between 20 June 1294 and 24 March 1298 England and France were formally and publicly at war .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #4:1>
Historians have been more than usually censorious about the nature and upshot of this war .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #5:1>
It was &lsquo; one of those wars that accomplish nothing and should never have occurred &rsquo; &semi; &lsquo; a complicated and ultimately futile conflict &rsquo; &semi; &lsquo; a prolonged but singularly inconclusive incident &rsquo; &semi; and &lsquo; a non-existent war from the military historian 's point of view &rsquo; . 1

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #7:1>
Such verdicts rest largely upon analysis of the damaging financial consequences of the conflict and its apparent lack of tactical and strategic interest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #8:1>
Yet lessons were learned from it by both sides which will be considered later in this chapter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #9:1>
To describe a conflict as &lsquo; futile &rsquo; or &lsquo; useless &rsquo; may be to place too high a value upon the efficacy of war as a solvent of political problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #10:1>
Medieval wars were not fought solely for political , econ<l>omic or material gain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #11:1>
A society which set a high value upon lavish gift-giving and exchange , and upon what later generations have seen as &lsquo; conspicuous waste &rsquo; and conscious dissipation of resources , was unlikely to have much room for more recent notions of both political and economic gain . 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #12:1>
2 See K.B. McFarlane , The Nobility of later Medieval England ( Oxford , 1973 ) , p. 96 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #13:1>
Warfare commenced when diplomacy failed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #14:1>
Diplomacy was conducted in a highly legalistic manner , and the points at issue in this extended lawsuit tended to focus upon rights and status as well as incomes and revenues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #15:1>
We should not underestimate the defence of honour or the realization of claims to certain titles , rights and privileges as motivating factors leading to the outbreak of open and public war during this period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #16:1>
Warfare was both a demonstration of right and a gesture , symptomatic of more general tendencies within later medieval society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #17:1>
However misguided and deluded we may believe the rulers of this period and their advisers to have been in seeking to resolve conflicts by force of arms , the relative weakness of diplomatic alternatives must always be borne in mind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #18:1>
Princes were conditioned to believe in the justificatory , and even cathartic nature of war as a positive force in human affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #19:1>
It was for the gens des comptes and the Exchequer or Wardrobe clerks to count the cost , and we might seek analogies between the behaviour of later medieval rulers and that of oriental and African potentates rather than with the &lsquo; constitutional &rsquo; monarchs of later epochs . 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #20:1>
3 See , for example E.E. Evans-Pritchard , &lsquo; Zande kings and princes &rsquo; in his Essays in Social Anthropology ( London , 1969 ) , pp. 87-116 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #21:1>
But there were many things which both the Plantagenets and Capetians had more will than strength to do .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #22:1>
The conduct of successful war , as the French learned in Aragon and Flanders , the English in Scotland , and both discovered in Aquitaine , demanded resources in money , manpower and supplies which ultimately lay beyond their available means .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #23:1>
If the Anglo-French war of 1294-8 proved anything , it was that neither side could hope to emerge victorious from a conflict fought exclusively in the duchy of Aquitaine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #24:1>
That in itself was a salutary lesson .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #25:1>
It has been observed that there is little evidence that Anglo-French tension &lsquo; was any more unbearable in 1293 than it had been earlier &rsquo; . 4

Until 1290 or so , it could on the contrary be argued that relations between the two kingdoms were relatively harmonious .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #28:1>
From the peace-making and arbi<l>tration of the period before 1294 , however , a transition to episodic warfare took place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #29:1>
Before that date we are presented with the image of a peace<l->loving Edward I , seeking to establish concord among the princes of Europe , moved by the interests of Holy Church and the promptings of a crusader 's conscience. 5

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #31:1>
In November 1294 , as war with Philip the Fair of France loomed , Edward was seeking the prayers of the Franciscan chapter-general assembled at Assisi that &lsquo; the present tempestuous time be succeeded by a more tranquil one &rsquo; . 6
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #32:1>
6 Foedera , I , ii , p. 815 ( 23 November 1294 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #33:1>
As a peace-maker Edward 's reputation between his accession and 1294 was high and he spent much time and energy on attempting to reconcile his warring kinsmen abroad . 7
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #34:1>
7 F.M. Powicke , The Thirteenth Century ( Oxford , 1954 ) , pp. 245-6 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #35:1>
In Sir Maurice Po<l>wicke 's account , Edward assumes the role of a benevolent uncle , striving ( often vainly ) to reconcile and placate a fractious group of squabbling children .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #36:1>
His own cosmopolitan background and pedigree placed him in an ideal position for such a task .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #37:1>
Close relationships between the courts of England , Savoy , Bar , Champagne , Brabant , Aragon , Castile , Navarre and Provence enabled him to act upon requests to arbitrate disputes with some confidence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #38:1>
Most analyses leave no room for aggression on Edward 's part -
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #39:1>
he had no wish to use his extensive continental connections against France , and he had no &lsquo; policy of encirclement &rsquo; which sought to isolate and surround the French kingdom , depriving it of allies in the Low Countries , Burgundy and Savoy. 8
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #40:1>
8 Powicke , Thirteenth Century , p. 246 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #41:1>
This may well be true of the first decades of his reign , but it could not be said of the years after 1294 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #42:1>
However , there is some evidence of increased tension before 1294 between Edward 's role as diplomatic arbiter and his vassalic status as liegeman of the French crown .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #43:1>
This is seen most clearly in the Gascon problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #44:1>
But there was a sense in which Edward 's reputation as , for want of a better word , a statesman and as the foremost representative of western knighthood , served to challenge and threaten the Capetian monarchy of France .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #45:1>
His personal role as arbitrator of disputes , for example , between the houses of Aragon and Anjou , acting from his own duchy of Aquitaine between 1286 and 1289 , hardly enhanced the status of Louis IX 's heirs . 9
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #46:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #47:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #48:1>
Knighthood at his hands was actively sought and highly prized , a further reflection of his reputation as knight and crusader .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #49:1>
There was , crucially , an unspoken expectation among English diplomatic envoys that both Philip III and his son would behave according to the accepted code of kingly honour in their dealings with Edward and his subjects , rather than as liege lord to vassal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #50:1>
But parity of status between the two kings could be difficult to achieve in this context .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #51:1>
On the Plantagenet side , Edward barely concealed his assertion of equality , as king of England , with the house of France in some of their exchanges and Edmund of Lancaster assumed in 1294 that Philip the Fair would act as &lsquo; loiaux Roy &rsquo; . 10
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #52:1>
10 Foedera , I , ii , p. 794 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #53:1>
Philip did not fulfil their expectations and the easy harmony of the Anglo-French circle was broken .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #54:1>
By the early 1290s , Edward I 's international reputation as a just ruler , who was prepared to implement justice - as he perceived it - by force of arms if necessary , was well known .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #55:1>
If the Maccabean victories depicted on the walls of the Painted Chamber at Westminster date from a campaign of works undertaken between 1292 and 1297 , then they are uniquely relevant as a reflection of Edward 's preoccupation with the justice of his cause - in Scotland and , after 1294 , in Aquitaine - at this time . 11
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #56:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #57:1>
Edward 's court &lsquo; resonated as a source of new imagery , particularly the new secular imagery of romance and chivalry &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #58:1>
The paintings were described in 1323 , very inaccurately , as showing &lsquo; all the warlike stories of the whole Bible &rsquo; , and their predominantly martial character may tell us some<l>thing about the ethos of Edward 's household in the 1290s . 12
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #59:1>
12 Binski , Painted Chamber , pp. 1 , 96-103 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #60:1>
As we have seen , reassertion of identification with the Plantagenet past also took place at this time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #61:1>
His progress of 1286-9 through France and Gascony had been an opportunity to renew existing associations and establish new ones , and Edward 's liberality towards religious houses and shrines , and the splendour of his entourage , did not pass unnoticed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #62:1>
He fulfilled expectations in an appropriately regal manner . 13

The young Philip the Fair was to some extent upstaged by Edward , as elder statesman , who took the cross during the chapter-general of the Dominicans at Bordeaux in May 1287 , preoccupied all the while with the search for peace between Aragon and Anjou as a necessary condition for the Crusade. 15

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #69:1>
This concern was apparently on Edward 's mind throughout this period and was in part to determine his behaviour towards the French .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #70:1>
Anglo-French relations degenerate from relative harmony into outright hostility in 1294 ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #71:1>
The answer to that question lies in a series of closely interrelated problems which are difficult to disentangle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #72:1>
Many were related to the search for a settlement of the Angevin-Aragonese conflict which erupted from the war of the Sicilian Vespers in 1284 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #73:1>
Edward 's dealings with the crown of Aragon in its war with the house of Anjou for the kingdom of Naples and Sicily should be assessed in the light of French humiliation after the disastrous &lsquo; Aragonese crusade &rsquo; of 1285 when a French invading army was overwhelmingly defeated . 16

By negotiating a truce between Philip the Fair and Alfonso of Aragon at Oloron-Ste-Marie in July 1287 , followed by the release of Charles of Salerno ( son of Charles of Anjou , titular king of Sicily ) under the terms of the treaty of Canfranc in October 1288 , Edward reversed the previous role of the French and English monarchies in diplomatic arbitration . 17

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #77:1>
The treaties of Oloron and Canfranc were perhaps not quite the equivalent of St Louis 's Mise of Amiens or his other arbitrations , but the fact that one who was technically a vassal of the French crown was intervening in this manner in Philip IV 's affairs could not pass disregarded by the French .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #78:1>
Moreover , Edward was undeniably popular with at least some of the Aragonese nobility .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #79:1>
Celebrated in troubadour poetry as &lsquo; the best lance in the world &rsquo; , and as Christendom 's best defender against the heathen , Edward 's repu<l>tation seems borne out by the eagerness of Catalan nobles to serve him in war . 18

In April 1294 , Artoldo de Alagone said that he had been in Edward 's company at Oloron in 1287 during the arbitration proceedings , and men<l>tioned the king 's great generosity towards him then. 19

The Catalans were to have a significant role in the events which led to the onset of Anglo-French war in 1293-4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #84:1>
By 1290 the problems associated with Edward 's authority and status in the duchy of Aquitaine were becoming more acute .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #85:1>
In the past it has often been argued that Edward was content to work within the limits set upon him by his father 's treaty of 1259 with Louis IX. 20
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #86:1>
20 Powicke , Thirteenth Century , p. 271
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #87:1>
His evasive actions in 1282 and 1285 , when he gave military aid to neither side in the Franco-Aragonese war , might appear to support this , but it could be argued that Edward 's aim was to limit , if not to undo , the more damaging effects of a treaty which , at least initially , he had vigorously opposed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #88:1>
He performed only a conditional form of homage to Philip the Fair in July 1286 and it was dependent upon French implementation of their part of the treaty of Paris. 21

<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #90:1>
Edward 's acquisition of the Agenais and the comt&eacute; of Ponthieu at Amiens in 1279 and of southern Saintonge in 1286 had substantially extended his power-base , while his brother Edmund 's marriage to Blanche of Artois in 1275 had given him a further northern French foothold in Champagne .
<ICE-GB:W2A-010 #91:1>
This had been lost as a result of Jeanne of Navarre 's marriage to Philip the Fair in 1284 . 22

<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #1:1>
Interdependencies
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #2:1>
It will be clear from the previous chapter that the innovations currently being implemented in industry and business involve both technological and organisational systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #3:1>
The emphasis overall must be on integration , and so the technological and organisational aspects have themselves become increasingly interdependent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #4:1>
For example , in manufacturing , the introduction of computer-integrated manufacturing ( CIM ) must involve both the technological system and an organisational approach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #5:1>
Without the organisational &lsquo; effort &rsquo; the full benefits are unlikely to be forthcoming .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #6:1>
Implementation has to be accompanied ( and preceded ) by strategic reappraisal of organisational aims , structures , practices and attitudes ( Campbell , 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #7:1>
The era of the simple technological &lsquo; fix &rsquo; , whereby specific innovations could be applied successfully in isolation from each other , is now remote , if indeed it ever existed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #8:1>
In this chapter we shall develop some of the issues dealt with in Chapter 2.1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #9:1>
We shall refer again to organisational structures , but primarily in connection with management roles and skills .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #10:1>
Priorities and Outcomes
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #11:1>
The discussion in Chapter 2.1 raises several questions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #12:1>
For example , given technological change , will managers have more or less flexible roles ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #13:1>
Will they have more or less distcretion discretion in decision-making ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #14:1>
Should management become more participative or less ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #15:1>
The answers to such questions depend , in part , on why new technologies are being introduced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #16:1>
As Child ( 1984 ) has pointed out :
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #17:1>
To this we can add that different managerial groups are likely to have different goals regarding technology , which may be related to different perceptions of the organisational environment and what its implications are for strategy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #18:1>
As we have seen , markets and the changes taking place within them provide one explanation for the extent of the interest in new technology :
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #X19:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #X20:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #21:1>
( Warner , 1986 , p. 280 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #22:1>
Market factors provide a link in the causal chain , leading to responses involving new technology ( although , as stated above and in Chapter 2.1 , the process can work the other way round ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #23:1>
The changes in markets and technologies in turn imply a variety of organisational effects , and therefore effects on managers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #24:1>
For example , in recent years markets for manufactured items have become fragmented , with more differentiated markets , smaller batches and greater customisation ( Campbell and Warner , 1988a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #25:1>
While in practice it is still likely that the &lsquo; giant company &rsquo; will continue to provide the context within which the activities of smaller firms operate ( Pratten , 1986 ) , the increased &lsquo; hiving off and sub-contracting to smaller firms represents one of the major organisational changes taking place in the manufacturing sector &rsquo; ( Shutt and Whittington , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #26:1>
There are thus a number of discernible trends towards decentralisation , reintegration of skills , smaller batch production and increased customisation ( linked to higher expectations from customers regarding quality ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #27:1>
So , in many situations , and not only in manufacturing , the use of new , potentially more flexible technologies makes economic , strategic and technical sense .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #28:1>
If organisations operated according to classical free-market theory , whereby firms are guided by &lsquo; market forces &rsquo; to make appropriate decisions , there would be no organisational problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #29:1>
However , as Senker ( 1988 ) has pointed out , the actions of management and of &lsquo; market forces &rsquo; are not the same thing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #30:1>
Management always have the discretion whether or not to innovate in a particular fashion , and the consequences of their not doing so , or doing so badly , may not immediately become apparent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #31:1>
This choice is a significant factor even where new technology is introduced as part of an integrated strategic approach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #32:1>
The potential for success may still be constrained by managements ' inabilities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #33:1>
Thus before looking at the implications of new technology for management , it is important to emphasise that management attitudes are crucial in terms of whether ( or how ) such changes take place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #34:1>
As Long ( 1987 , p. 257 ) argues :
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #X35:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #36:1>
Impact of New Technologies on Management Roles
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #37:1>
Management structures may emphasise either the vertical or the horizontal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #38:1>
If the former , roles and tasks are sharply delineated and communication ( in theory ) is rooted in the lines of hierarchical authority .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #39:1>
If the latter is emphasised there is more delegation of responsibility , the flow of information is more open , and there is a blurring of organisational barriers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #40:1>
Organisations of the latter type tend to be more adaptive , as we saw in Chapter 2.1 , and it is such organisations that are more likely to be successful in periods of rapid change .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #41:1>
At present organisations are being influenced in the direction of a more horizontally oriented structure , not only by the pace of change generally , but also by the intrinsic qualities of the technologies involved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #42:1>
This process is likely to be accelerated ( and complicated ) by the expanded networks of informal links that occur where task groups and project or matrix structures are involved ( Campbell and Warner , 1988b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #43:1>
These forms of &lsquo; team work &rsquo; are likely to become an enduring feature of organisation where new technology is concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #44:1>
The above trend confirms the findings of Rothwell ( 1984 ) on new technology and the elimination of the supervisory level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #45:1>
If such elimination occurs , it would be very likely to amplify the role played by middle management , along with the latter 's need , in present circumstances , to liaise more closely with customers and suppliers regarding design , deliveries , quality and service .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #46:1>
A different scenario is of course possible :
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #47:1>
the potential provided by technology for closer monitoring by senior management could be used by them as a protective cloak under which they would have few reservations about delegating more responsibility to supervisory level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #48:1>
Middle management , therefore , deprived of both its authority-enforcing and information-passing roles , could be rendered increasingly redundant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #49:1>
Such a projection may depend on how the term &lsquo; middle management &rsquo; is defined .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #50:1>
If , for example , decentralisation of functional or business units is increased , and this decentralisation takes place on account of senior management 's increased ability to monitor performance from a remote point , are the managers who head up such satellite units &lsquo; senior managers &rsquo; , or does their increased day-to-day accountability to the organisational &lsquo; core &rsquo; of senior managers mean that their status is in reality lower than it would have been considered in the past ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #51:1>
Impact on Management Skills
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #52:1>
What new skills will &lsquo; technology managers &rsquo; need ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #53:1>
First , they will need to be more technically aware , if not technically qualified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #54:1>
German firms have an existing advantage as a greater number of their managers have technical or engineering degrees .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #55:1>
Japanese managers , too , have technical qualifications of a high order ( see Handy et al. , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #56:1>
Second , they need specific management training to acquire the appropriate &lsquo; interpersonal skills &rsquo; needed for operating within more complex , less hierarchical organisational structures ( in addition to the likelihood of more external contacts ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #57:1>
The nature of managerial work , and therefore the skill requirements also , will change , from first-line supervisor to top management , according to Boddy and Buchanan ( 1986 , p. 181 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #58:1>
Managers need to be able to manage the process of change , in which communication plays a very significant part .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #59:1>
With the introduction of information technology into increasingly complex areas of the business , the management of change becomes an intrinsic part of the management role , rather than being associated with one-off projects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #60:1>
Whether in financial services , retailing or manufacturing , competitive pressure and expansion in the range of viable applications mean that there is frequently no clear break between successive stages of a particular innovation project , and no clear dividing line between projects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #61:1>
This will have a number of consequences for management roles , which will be acted out within what may be termed a &lsquo; culture of permanent implementation &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #62:1>
Technological Awareness and Organisational Politics
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #63:1>
There may be an increase in the power of whichever internal function has most control over , or awareness of , systems development and application .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #64:1>
This is important in terms of the relationships between senior and middle management .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #65:1>
Although senior management reserve the power to make strategic decisions , those lower down , if they have an awareness of the strategic dimensions of systems-related decisions , may exercise a hidden influence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #66:1>
This potential will clearly be pronounced to the extent that senior management lack such an awareness ( Campbell et al. , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #67:1>
The lack of such an awareness at higher levels may , however , suffocate strategically appropriate use of new technology , or the adjustment of strategy to derive the full benefits available from its use .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #68:1>
A survey of consultants ' views on systems implementation ( Campbell , 1989 ) revealed this lack of awareness to be a recurrent problem in terms of effective choice and implementation of systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #69:1>
Senior managers in many firms were said to fail to comprehend the scope of changes implied by a move into or up-grading of information technology .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #70:1>
As a result , consultants found themselves forced to play down some of these implications in the early stages for fear of losing the contract .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #71:1>
Where internal managers rather than external consultants play the leading role in initiating change of this type , a similar sequence of events is not uncommon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #72:1>
With internal managers there may , however , be some benefit in political terms , since the same lack of awareness at higher levels that necessitates the use of guile on their part may consolidate their &lsquo; ownership &rsquo; ( see Pettigrew , 1973 ) of the technology concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #73:1>
The studies referred to in the previous section found decisions on the acquisition , implementation and up-dating of technology to be highly political in terms of the managerial interactions involved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #74:1>
This is in apparent contrast to the findings of a larger survey by Hickson et al. ( 1986 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #75:1>
The latter study found decisions on new technology ( in most cases ) to be &lsquo; not unduly complex or political &rsquo; , unlike other areas of decision-making , where the politicality derived from the range of functions and personnel involved ( as in major reorganisation , for example ) , such that the decision became a &lsquo; vortex &rsquo; drawing everything in behind it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #76:1>
The reason for the discrepancy between these two views on technology is of fundamental importance for the subject of this chapter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #77:1>
In the study of Hickson et al. decisions were identifiably of political importance because they were seen to imply major changes for a wide range of different groups and for the functioning of the organisation as a whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #78:1>
With new technology , according to our findings , the politics of decision-making were more hidden , and derived precisely from the fact that such decisions were not seen by senior managers to have far-reaching implications for the business , while others ( whether inside or outside the organisation ) did see such implications if any benefit was to be derived .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #79:1>
This lack of awareness is more serious to the extent that each successive decision on technology may narrow the effective scope for manoeuvre on further decisions ( Clark et al. , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #80:1>
Managerial Misconceptions of Technology
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #81:1>
The preceding section points to the need for a more thorough understanding by senior management of new technology and its strategic potential and implications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #82:1>
Two fallacies are held by the more traditional managers : first that technological systems are ultimately &lsquo; pieces of kit to do a job &rsquo; and unproblematic in terms of effective incorporation and utilisation &semi; and second , that investment in such &lsquo; kit &rsquo; is a one-off decision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #83:1>
In fact , it may mean the beginning of a complex series of projects involving modification , up-dating and recommissioning , to say nothing of the need to review and restructure organisational procedures and train and retain staff .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #84:1>
Systems applications rely in the long term on the accumulation of knowledge within the organisation , not merely technical knowledge of data-processing , etc. , but a broader understanding of the benefits systems can provide , what configuration of systems functions best suits the needs of the business and how best to implement with a view to achieving those benefits .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #85:1>
Matching technology to the needs of the business is not the only problem , however .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #86:1>
Too often managers have doubts on what their strategic requirements actually are , and are therefore all the more likely to pursue the &lsquo; technological fix &rsquo; , hoping that expenditure on technology will of itself fill in the gap left by their lack of a coherent or forward-looking strategy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #87:1>
Although overall strategy may be the preserve of senior management , such strategies only work through the development and implementation of sub-strategies at lower levels ( Clark et al. , 1988 , p. 33 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #88:1>
The successful development and implementation of strategy relies on co-operation and communication at all levels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-011 #89:1>
The findings of Rothwell ( 1985 , p. 375 ) are not encouraging in this regard , showing decisions on technology to be usually &lsquo; top-down &rsquo; in character , to the extent that supervisors and end-users are often the last to know about the nature of the changes proposed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #1:1>
No one knows exactly how many new religions there are , nor does anyone know how many members are in each movement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #2:1>
Depending on how &lsquo; new religious movement &rsquo; is defined , it is possible to claim that there are hundreds , thousands , or tens of thousands , but many of these movements will have well under a hundred members. 10
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #3:1>
What is rarely admitted by either the move<l>ments or their detractors is that there is a very high turnover rate , with far more people leaving the than staying in them for more than a limited period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #4:1>
In other words , many people have &lsquo; gone through &rsquo; the movements , but only a few have stayed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #5:1>
There are , for example , only about 250 full-time Moonies in Britain at the present time , with roughly the same number of British Moonies overseas , mainly in North America &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #6:1>
the number of Krishna devotees is comparable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #7:1>
Such statistics obviously question the so-called &lsquo; brainwashing thesis &rsquo; , which claims that once such a movement has got a victim into its clutches , he or she will never be able to escape . 11
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #8:1>
Given the variety to be found within and between the move<l>ments , it is not altogether surprising that variety is to be found in the characteristics of those who join them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #9:1>
It is certainly not the case that all those who become members of one of the new religious movements are necessarily oppressed and/or inadequate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #10:1>
In fact , although some movements ( the Rastafarians and the People 's Temple are examples ) have appealed to poor blacks , it is quite clear that the majority of the new religions attract their members from the privileged middle classes , and a growing body of research has indicated that those who join the movements are no more likely to be psychologically disturbed than are the majority of their peers . 12
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #11:1>
Those who enter into a life of total commitment are likely to be in their twenties &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #12:1>
those who enter upon expensive courses are more likely to be in their thirties or forties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #13:1>
It is possible to argue that one of the reasons for the variety of the new religions and the attraction that they hold for some people is related directly to the more general , secular pluralism of modern society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #14:1>
At a fairly obvious level , one can point to the ever<l>increasing division of labour , with sons and daughters less and less commonly following in their fathers ' or mothers ' footsteps , frequent social and geographical mobility , and greatly enhanced opportunities to travel , to learn about alternative world-views and life-styles through the diverse channels of the media and the continuous waves of immigration from the East ( and , indeed , previously unfamiliar parts of the West ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #15:1>
All this means that people have different experiences , different ( often heightened ) expectations , and different opportunities to shop around in the various markets of a pluralist society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #16:1>
To switch the metaphor : rather than producing a melting-pot in which differences disappear , the increased input has resulted in an ever<l>expanding smorgasbord .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #17:1>
It can , indeed , be argued that each new potential for experiencing a variety of cultural , political , and/or economic aspects of a society results in a further potential for novel schisms and syntheses &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #18:1>
pluralism can reinforce itself as it leads to the creation of further divisions , distinctions , distortions , and discoveries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #19:1>
But pluralism can also foster a potential threat to pluralism from within itself .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #20:1>
While societal pluralism allows for , and can even encourage , the existence of a wide range of permissible attitudes , beliefs , life<l>styles , and values , it is also the case that the very permission which allows the supra - ( and other ) markets to offer such variety will encompass organizations that can restrict rather than enhance the options available at the individual level - sometimes , but by no means always , as a consequence of the individual 's own volition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #21:1>
Not all values and not all ways of life are compatible -
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #22:1>
many of those celebrated by contemporary western society are in direct conflict with each other .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #23:1>
We find , for example , value placed on both individualism and community &semi; on both freedom and security .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #24:1>
This can lead not only to tensions but also to some curious contra<l>dictions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #25:1>
For example , it is not difficult to recognize instances of conforming individualism , organized spontaneity , determined freedom - and so on . 13
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #26:1>
There are various ways of dealing with the contradictory options that arise within society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #27:1>
One is to allow the contradictions to appear side by side &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #28:1>
another is to try to eliminate any inconsistency by adhering to a single truth that excludes all competition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #29:1>
The first ( the pluralist ) solution has both the strengths and the weaknesses of ambiguity and uncertainty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #30:1>
While it enables there to be constant checks , balancing , and flexibility in dealing with problems as they arise , many people find the lack of absolute certainties psychologically uncomfortable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #31:1>
It is possible that these people will seek an ideology that espouses unambiguous truths and a community of like-minded believers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #32:1>
This is , indeed , what many of the new religions offer their members - a haven of certainty within the shifting sands of modern pluralism . 14
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #33:1>
At the same time , there are new religions that offer their member release from those constraints which exist in a complex , imper<l>sonal society , and which extend the promise of enriched relation<l>ships , self-development , heightened spirituality , and unbridled explorations into the true , inner being of consciousness ( or what<l>ever ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #34:1>
Neither of these types of new religious movements is likely to permit much in the way of &lsquo; internal pluralism &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #35:1>
Not all sects are new religious movements , but many of the new religions exhibit the sectarian characteristic of proclaiming an exclusive truth , and even those that claim that they do not do so may , in practice , turn out to be far less internally tolerant of diversity than might at first appear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #36:1>
It could be claimed that the same was true of many of the &lsquo; old religions &rsquo; , but religions tend to change in many ways as they become more established &semi; 15
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #37:1>
second and subsequent generations are less likely to be as fervent as the convert in their beliefs &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #38:1>
the mere fact of growth in numbers means that believers in a differentiated modern society will have different experiences , and it will become increasingly unlikely that each member will have the same perception and understanding of the faith .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #39:1>
This is not to say that large , well-organized , and long<l>established long established religions may not be monolithic - history clearly shows us that they can be , but it is to suggest that the more established a religion is in a pluralistic society , the more &lsquo; internal pluralism &rsquo; it is likely to display . 16
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #40:1>
Even those who have argued that established , traditional religions present a major hegemonic force can recognize their potential for developing an &lsquo; internal pluralism &rsquo; :
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #X41:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #42:1>
The coexistence of variety in and around the Church of England has been cogently illuminated by Robert Towler 's analysis of the letters received by the then Bishop of Woolwich , John Robinson , after the publication of what has been described as the best-known religious book of the twentieth century , Honest to God . 18
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #43:1>
Some 4,000 people ( most of whom had heard about , but not actually read the book ) wrote to Dr Robinson , telling him of their own faith , beliefs , convictions , feelings , or special knowledge concern<l>ing matters religious .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #44:1>
These letters provided the data that Towler used to construct a set of &lsquo; Ideal Types &rsquo; which would describe a range of ways in which the British population is &lsquo; conventionally religious &rsquo; . 19
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #45:1>
Five distinct types emerged from the analysis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #46:1>
The first type , &lsquo; exemplarism &rsquo; is a Christian form of humanism &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #47:1>
the idea of God is seen as unnecessary and unreal &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #48:1>
&lsquo; Jesus appears as the pinnacle of human aspiration , not as the link between the human and the divine . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #49:1>
The second type , &lsquo; conversionism &rsquo; , is based on the conviction that the only hope for salvation is to have been &lsquo; born again &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #50:1>
Two boundaries define the conversionist 's life :
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #51:1>
for the individual , there is the wretched period before , and the completely transformed period after , rebirth &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #52:1>
within society , there are those who have not accepted the Lord Jesus , and there is the fellowship of true believers who have .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #53:1>
The third type , &lsquo; theism &rsquo; , is a religious attitude that is grounded in a sense of wonder and awe , and which focuses on God as a benevolent creator .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #54:1>
Jesus is not seen as especially divine , for such a vision would detract from the great<l>ness and majesty of God .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #55:1>
Theists tend not to &lsquo; believe that &rsquo; so much as to &lsquo; believe in &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #56:1>
&lsquo; Gnostics &rsquo; , however , &lsquo; know that &rsquo; , and concentrate on knowledge of the spiritual world &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #57:1>
God is perceived as a principle rather than a person or a being .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #58:1>
A strongly defined dualism distinguishes between the ( everlasting ) divine soul within each one of us , and the ( transitory ) material body which clothes it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #59:1>
Finally , there is the &lsquo; traditionalist &rsquo; , who believes in and will &lsquo; cherish and hold dear &rsquo; everything that is conventionally a part of the Christian religion . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #60:1>
Not altogether surprisingly , traditionalists tended to be exceedingly upset by the publication of Honest to God .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #61:1>
Towler does not claim that his typology was exhaustive - he might , for example , have added mysticism or millenarianism - but he convincingly demonstrates that assumptions that only one type of religiousness represents &lsquo; real &rsquo; Christianity or even &lsquo; real &rsquo; Anglicanism are unwarranted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #62:1>
The conclusion is that orthodox , conventional religion is composed of a number of distortions that exaggerate different , but legitimate , strands , which &lsquo; taken together , and held together ... keep one another in check , and the result is &ldquo; normal &rdquo; Christianity &rsquo; . 20
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #63:1>
So long as these different , but legitimate strands are taken together and held together within the institutional boundaries of the Church of England and , to a lesser or greater extent , other traditional churches , they can keep each other in check .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #64:1>
But , as has already been suggested , the pluralism of modern society also embraces options that are internally monolithic in belief and/or practice .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #65:1>
In other words , within the pluralist society , one is free to choose to be unconfronted by choice &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #66:1>
one may find oneself choosing from the variety to have no variety .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #67:1>
It has already been suggested that not only might one make such a choice at a relatively conscious level in the case of those movements that clearly demand an unquestioning commitment to an uncompromising , absolute truth , but also that the denial of one 's freedom can , just as surely , be the unintended consequence of becoming embroiled in one of the movements that actually promise their members freedom from the constraints of modern society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #68:1>
Within such a movement the pursuit of freedom can be a genuine source of individual freedom , but it can also result in surrender to the well-nigh unconditional control of others .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #69:1>
There are numerous variables that can contribute towards an increasing totalitarianism within a new religious movement :
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #70:1>
one fairly obvious one is physical isolation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #71:1>
This was , of course , evi<l>dent in the tragic case of Jonestown , Guyana , where over 900 of the followers of Jim Jones committed suicide or were murdered in 1978 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #72:1>
While not in a remote part of the jungle of an alien country , relatively isolated communities such as Bhagwan 's Oregon ranch , Rajneeshpuram , and the ISKCON Temple com<l>plex , New Vrindaban , West Virginia , have been recent examples of authoritarian control being wielded by a charismatic individual and/or a small elite group .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #73:1>
In such situations , criminal acts have been performed by those who find themselves falling victim to some of the very evils from which they had hoped to escape by joining the movement . 21
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #74:1>
I hope that enough has already been said about the differences between the movements to make it clear that no single scenario could possibly describe the range of their potential development , but one scenario that is by no means confined to a single move<l>ment can be briefly sketched .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #75:1>
Movements that demand surrender from their members tend to erect a strong social barrier that will cut them off from the rest of society , even when there is little in the way of a geographical barrier . 22
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #76:1>
In such cases , it is likely that the movement will regard non-members with a suspicion that leads them ( the non-members ) to react in a way that seems to confirm to the insiders that they are fully justified in their distrust .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #77:1>
Suspicion of outsiders is quite likely to develop into a suspicion that there are insiders who may not be sufficiently committed to the Truth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #78:1>
Anyone who questions the beliefs or actions of the leaders becomes defined first as disruptive , then as disloyal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #79:1>
Mem<l>bers become more and more constrained - less and less free to explore ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #80:1>
The Truth that is conceived in absolute , unidimen<l>sional terms is so unquestionably Right that methods which go against even the stated values of the Truth are thought to be justified by reference to the Ultimate goal of establishing the Truth at a higher and/or more complete level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #81:1>
Eventually there is no permissible way of redressing the balance when things go too far in one direction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #82:1>
It is expected that those who are suggesting alternative ideas or means of achieving the common goal will be reported to the leaders , and then , when the potential reporters are suspected of not reporting , a 1984-type system of spying ( possibly incorporating the use of electronic surveillance ) is established .
<ICE-GB:W2A-012 #83:1>
So too is Big Brother ( or , in the case of Ma Prem Sheela , Big Sister ) and his/her every whim . 23

INSTITUTIONAL CARE AND COMMUNITY CARE
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #3:1>
The first half of Chapter 5 looks at the interface between institutional provision ( residential homes and nursing homes ) and housing provision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #4:1>
The second half of this chapter looks at the interface between community care and housing policy .

The future development of government policy towards both institutional care and community care will have significant repercussions upon the housing finance implications of an ageing population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #6:1>
The demography section of Chapter 1 underlined the ageing of the elderly population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #7:1>
It is the &lsquo; old old &rsquo; or those over 75 who are most likely to experience major health and mobility problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #8:1>
It has been estimated that by 2001 , more than 3 million people over 65 will be living alone , 185,000 will be unable to get out of bed unaided and nearly 700,000 will be suffering from dementia ( Sinclair , 1988 , p 246 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #9:1>
Such figures lead some commentators to talk of a demographic time bomb .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #10:1>
These trends are of major concern to a government with a strong policy objective to control public expenditure on all its social programmes ( Thain and Wright , 1990 ) and to reduce the level of direct state involvement in service provision ( Flynn , 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #11:1>
This combination of factors has initiated a major debate about how best to meet the growing care need of the &lsquo; old old &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #12:1>
Should this be through institutional care or should elderly people be encouraged to remain in their own homes ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #13:1>
This debate has important implications for housing finance issues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #14:1>
For example :
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #15:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #16:1>
Would a growth of institutional care influence future inheritance patterns through residents paying their fees from home sale receipts ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #17:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #18:1>
Should elderly people be encouraged to use home equity release schemes to meet their health and social care needs ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #19:1>
3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #20:1>
What are the design and adaptation implications of encouraging older people with disabilities to remain in their own homes ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #21:1>
These and other issues are discussed in this section .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #22:1>
First , however , it is necessary to say something about the changing politics of community care to put the subsequent discussion in context .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #23:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #24:1>
The changing politics of community care
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #25:1>
In December 1986 , the Secretary of State for Social Services asked Sir Roy Griffiths &ldquo; to review the way in which public funds are used to support community care policy and to advise me on the options for action that would improve the use of these funds as a contribution to more effective community care &rdquo; for what the report calls &ldquo; adults who are mentally ill , mentally handicapped , elderly or physically disabled and similar groups &rdquo; ( Griffiths Report , 1988 , p 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #26:1>
Community Care : Agenda for Action was published in March 1988 and called for social services departments to be given the lead role in community care planning at the local level for all these need groups &semi; for central government to provide earmarked funds for service development &semi; and for a mixed economy of provision in which the private and voluntary sectors would play the lead role in service provision .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #27:1>
Local authority social services departments would plan and regulate &semi; the private and voluntary sectors would provide services &semi; and health authorities would concern themselves only with the medical components of community care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #28:1>
Sir Roy also argued for more public expenditure to be directed to community services and less towards funding the fees of elderly people in private residential homes and nursing homes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #29:1>
With regard to housing , he argued that housing authorities should only provide &ldquo; bricks and mortar &rdquo; so that , for example , all wardens of sheltered schemes for rent should be employed by social services authorities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #30:1>
The report also argued that better-off adults had a responsibility to plan for their own social and health care needs so that public resources could be targeted at those in greatest need .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #31:1>
The Griffiths Report was not received with great enthusiasm by the Conservative government who disliked the emphasis upon local authorities as lead agencies and the idea of a major expansion of earmarked funds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #32:1>
A White Paper entitled Caring for People : Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond was , however , finally published in November 1989 ( Secretaries of State , 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #33:1>
This confirmed the lead role of social services departments , emphasised the need to maximise the use of the private and &lsquo; not for profit &rsquo; sectors as service providers and changed the arrangements for providing public subsidy for those in private residential and nursing home care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #34:1>
However , the White Paper offered little in the way of earmarked funds other than a limited scheme for those with mental health problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #35:1>
The main proposals of the White Paper will come into operation in April 1991 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #36:1>
With regard to housing , the White Paper had much more to say about its importance than the Griffiths Report .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #37:1>
&ldquo; Suitable good quality housing &rdquo; is seen as &ldquo; essential &rdquo; to social care packages ( Secretaries of State , 1989 , p 9 ) and the importance of improvement grants , Care and Repair schemes and Staying Put schemes are all stressed ( Secretaries of State , 1989 , p 25 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #38:1>
It is argued that &ldquo; social services authorities will need to work closely with housing authorities , housing associations and other providers of housing of all types in developing plans for a full and flexible range of housing &rdquo; ( Secretaries of State , 1989 , p 25 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #39:1>
The groups covered by the Griffiths Report and the subsequent White Paper were neglected in the welfare legislation of the 1940 s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #40:1>
Services for these groups tended to be institution based , whether provided through the National Health Service ( NHS ) or local government , and they were often starved of funds relative to that available for the acute sick ( in the NHS ) or for children ( in local authorities ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #41:1>
There was a professional pessimism about the ability to help the so called so-called &lsquo; chronic sick &rsquo; and so the neglect of their services seemed justified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #42:1>
A common term for the services of these groups became &lsquo; the Cinderella services &rsquo; , an attempt to express their failure to capture resources ( Means and Smith , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #43:1>
The development of legislative support for domiciliary services and community care provision has been slow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #44:1>
The 1946 National Health Service Act enabled local authorities to provide a home help service .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #45:1>
The provision of residential accommodation was the main responsibility placed on local authorities by the 1948 National Assistance Act .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #46:1>
Section 29 did empower local authorities &ldquo; to promote the welfare of persons who are blind , deaf or dumb , and others who are substantially and permanently handicapped by illness , injury or congenital deformity &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #47:1>
The Act did not allow local authorities to promote the welfare of elderly people , or to carry out preventive social work with this group .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #48:1>
Local authorities could grant aid to a voluntary agency to provide a &lsquo; meals on wheels &rsquo; service , but it was illegal to provide a direct service of its own .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #49:1>
The voluntary sector , and especially local old people 's welfare committees ( now local branches of Age Concern ) were encouraged to play the lead coordination role in visiting schemes , luncheon clubs , meals on wheels services and so forth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #50:1>
Gradually , this situation changed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #51:1>
A 1962 Amendment Act to the 1948 legislation empowered local authorities to provide their own meals on wheels services .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #52:1>
The 1968 Health Services and Public Health Act gave local authorities the general power to promote the welfare of elderly people , and the 1970 Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act placed a further set of obligations on local authorities , with regard to community care provision ( for example , assessment for a telephone ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #53:1>
But the implementation of these last two Acts was delayed until April 1971 so as to coincide with the creation of unified social services departments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #54:1>
These new departments were soon dominated by child care concerns , especially after the death of Maria Colwell in January 1973 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #55:1>
Hopes of a major expansion of domiciliary services were further hit by the first tremors on the public expenditure front in the mid-1970s with the oil crisis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #56:1>
Increasingly , debate shifted away from the need for overall increases in social care expenditure towards arguments about the need for a shift of priorities between domiciliary and residential provision ( Means , 1986 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #57:1>
Government interest in community care became far more marked in the early 1980s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #58:1>
They were becoming concerned about demographic projections on the likely growth in the number of older people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #59:1>
They wished to close down expensive long-stay hospital provision for other community care groups , especially those with learning difficulties and those with mental health problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #60:1>
A succession of government and semi-official reports criticised the performance of community care services , especially over slowness in running down long-stay hospitals .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #61:1>
This was seen as partly the result of organisational fragmentation between health authorities , social services authorities and housing authorities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #62:1>
These reports complained increasingly at how private residential homes and private nursing homes were being used to facilitate hospital run-down &semi; consumers were being moved from one institution ( NHS hospital ) to another ( a private sector home ) rather than into ordinary housing , backed up by community services .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #63:1>
The most damning report was produced by the Audit Commission ( 1986 ) entitled Making a Reality of Community Care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #64:1>
This report asked the government to establish a high level review and hence the appointment of Sir Roy Griffiths .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #65:1>
Issues in residential care
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #66:1>
Perhaps the most striking feature of institutional care in Britain has been the consistent percentage of older people who enter such care over time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #67:1>
Over the last four centuries , this percentage has only varied from 3% to 6% ( Fennell , Phillipson and Evers , 1988 , p 29 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #68:1>
Table 40 breaks down the different components of institutional care , although unfortunately it was not possible to separate elderly people from younger adults who are chronically ill or have physical disabilities . table 40
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #69:1>
Public institutional provision ( NHS beds and residential homes ) will now be considered and this will be followed by a review of the private residential and nursing home sector .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #70:1>
The emphasis throughout will be on funding and home equity release issues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #71:1>
The section concludes by considering the likely impact of the proposals of the White Paper upon future trends in residential care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #72:1>
The NHS inherited large numbers of long stay hospitals where the &lsquo; chronic sick &rsquo; were kept in terrible conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #73:1>
Many of these patients were suffering from frailty rather than ill-health .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #74:1>
Increasingly , local authorities were encouraged to take over responsibility for this group leaving the NHS to concern itself with those elderly patients requiring either a rehabilitation programme after ill-health or long-term nursing care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #75:1>
However , despite the growth in the elderly population , geriatric hospital bed provision has been in decline in recent years .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #76:1>
Increasingly , long-stay elderly patients are encouraged to enter private nursing homes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #77:1>
Elderly people in NHS beds retain their pension and the full costs of their care are met by the NHS .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #78:1>
This is , therefore , the most expensive form of institutional provision by the state and one in which owner occupier patients are not under any pressure to use their home equity assets to meet their health care costs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #79:1>
We will see later that this changes very quickly once they enter a private nursing home .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #80:1>
Local authority residential homes were established by Section 21 of the 1948 National Assistance Act which stated that : it shall be the duty of every local authority .... to provide residential accommodation for persons who by reason of age , infirmity or any other circumstances are in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #81:1>
The residents of these homes were expected to pay 21 shillings a week from their 26 shillings pension and keep five shillings for &lsquo; pocket money &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #82:1>
This was in marked contrast with the previous system of public assistance institutions whose inmates lost their pension rights and where a charge for upkeep could be levied on other members of the family ( Means and Smith , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #83:1>
In other respects the 1948 National Assistance Act had limited impact upon the previous system of institutional care .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #84:1>
Residential homes were usually the same buildings as public assistance institutions and run by the same staff who were offered no re<l->training .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #85:1>
It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that there was a major expansion of purpose-built residential homes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #86:1>
From the early 1960s , there was a growing critique of local authority residential homes as the prime social welfare provision for older people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #87:1>
Townsend ( 1964 ) in his national survey of homes argued that residents suffer from a loss of occupation &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #88:1>
they fail to make new relationships &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #89:1>
they experience a loss of privacy and identity &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #90:1>
and they suffer a collapse of powers of self determination .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #91:1>
Townsend ( 1964 , p 190 ) concluded that residential homes failed to give residents &ldquo; the advantages of living in a &lsquo; normal &rsquo; community &rdquo; and they should be abandoned .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #92:1>
The alternative was to improve pensions , expand sheltered housing and develop preventive medical and domiciliary services .
<ICE-GB:W2A-013 #93:1>
Over 20 years later Booth ( 1985 , p 209 ) was complaining that all 175 homes in his sample : .... contain a very sizeable proportion of really quite independent residents , many of whom , according to staff , should not have been admitted in the first place or , after a spell of care , could have been moved into other accommodation more suited to their needs .

<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #1:1>
Our overall approach is that of organisational analysts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #2:1>
Other social researchers could equally well have chosen to examine behaviour and lifestyles , patients ' perceptions of care , to derive indicators of quality , or to collect costs data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #3:1>
These are all important topics for social research in the Aids field .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #4:1>
But our initial focus was how a health care Organisation responded to a major new disease given important constraints on its action .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #5:1>
Can a district make radical changes to patterns of services quickly ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #6:1>
What are the special problems of responding to a &lsquo; new issue &rsquo; which has blown up on a crisis basis ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #7:1>
What are the motors of and barriers to change ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #8:1>
The district concerned was a Resource Allocation Working Party ( RAWP ) loser , faced internal competition for declining resources and was concerned that a balance of specialties should be retained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #9:1>
There was also the question of whether certain services ( such as Aids ) are &lsquo; bad for image &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #10:1>
We therefore need to develop an initial reference framework which can sensitise us to key debates in the field of change in the health care sector in general and the Aids issue in particular .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #11:1>
These are not hypotheses to test , nor were we able to impose any sort of experimental design which allowed for the controlling of certain variables , but they are broad themes which influenced the collection and analysis of more qualitative data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #12:1>
However , the approach elaborated here combines categories derived from the data with initial categories formed on the basis of other research .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #13:1>
It contrasts with the method of purely grounded analysis with no a priori questions outlined by Glaser and Strauss ( 1967 ) ( see Strong and Robinson , 1988 , for a recent example of this approach ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #14:1>
Why have we adopted this compromise ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #15:1>
Given the very recent emergence of the Aids issue , the high degree of uncertainty and of fluidity and given also its political and social complexity , any analysis must be flexible enough to capture diverse and rapidly changing definitions of the problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #16:1>
Highly standardised methods based on measurement and replication could not easily reflect nuances of behaviour and perception .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #17:1>
On the other hand locating the initial research questions in a wider body of literature enables us to script in previously derived knowledge about how health care organisations function , not to get trapped in detail and believe that everything within the case study is sui generis , and to project our data against this established knowledge base .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #18:1>
There has also been an emphasis within the methodology on retrospective analysis using a longitudinal case study approach and on tracing the Aids issue back to its origins , and even exploring some of the antecedent conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #19:1>
We need to establish such a history if we believe that the assumptions of today may be heavily shaped by the events of the past .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #20:1>
There seem three such blocks of literature which could help move the case study analysis on to a more thematic basis and generate subsequent topics for discussion : ( 1 ) literature on organisational change , in both the public and private sectors &semi; ( 2 ) the characteristics of Aids as a new issue &semi; ( 3 ) the emergent literature on the potential impact of general manage<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #21:1>
We consider each in turn .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #22:1>
Each sheds a different light on this key question :
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #23:1>
given the assumption that incrementalism is generally dominant within the health sector , can health care organisations ever change their pattern of services and their &lsquo; policy &rsquo; rapidly ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #24:1>
If so , what are the forces associated with change and with continuity ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #25:1>
ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE PROCESSES
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #26:1>
The wider literature on organisational change in the NHS has been reviewed by Pettigrew , McKee and Ferlie ( 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #27:1>
But at a more focused level of analysis one can ask : how do specific new patterns of service or more grandly , service &lsquo; policies &rsquo; , emerge ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #28:1>
These questions relate in turn to well established bodies of work on organisational decision making and processes of change both within private sector organisations and ( traditionally evolving in a separate manner ) the social policy literature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #29:1>
The politics of organisational decision making is a well established theme in literature on change processes in private sector organisations ( Pettigrew , 1973 &semi; 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #30:1>
Considering the organisation as a political system directs attention ( among other areas ) to the group based factors which facilitate and hinder change , including the identification of a variety of interest groups which may intervene in the change process , each possessed of a different rationality for action .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #31:1>
Strategy is a key concept within this literature , but one which should be treated as a process rather than an output , conceived of as consistency over time in a stream of decisions ( Mintzberg , 1978 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #32:1>
Organisational style as well as structure can be seen as related to the organisational propensity to innovate : what Kanter ( 1985 ) terms &lsquo; integrative &rsquo; ( treating problems as wholes ) rather than segmented thinking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #33:1>
Recently some concepts have been moving across the sectoral divide and found to be useful within the public sector :
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #34:1>
Stocking 's ( 1985 ) idea of a clinical product champion derived from work originally done on industrial innovation , while the strategy literature has also found increasing resonance within the NHS , particularly associated with the writings of Tom Evans ( Stocking ( ed. ) , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #35:1>
No doubt the literature on private sector change could also benefit from some of the work in the public sector ( managing in a dense political environment &semi; the role of professionals within bureaucracies ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #36:1>
While there are clearly important differences between private and public sector organisations , particular and well specified concepts have moved across the sectoral divide .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #37:1>
Yet broadly speaking the literature on policy change within what might be loosely termed the &lsquo; welfare state &rsquo; , although exploring similar arguments in some ways , has developed its own tradition , rooted if anything in more basic political science literature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #38:1>
The attempt by Hall et al. ( 1975 ) to examine social policy changes within a political science framework contrasted pluralist models of decision making ( a wide range of competing pressure groups , policy stability , moderate conflict and incremental issue resolution ) , a class model of decision making ( a narrow and relatively homogenous class bias , marked inequalities in power , a potentially high level of conflict often hidden by considerable ability to keep issues off agendas ) and their preference for a model of &lsquo; bounded &rsquo; pluralism ( where there could be competition between elites , which in turn could also coalesce to keep difficult issues off agendas ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #39:1>
New issues did not rise up agendas automatically but required legitimation , needed to be seen as &lsquo; feasible &rsquo; and depended on a critical mass of powerful support .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #40:1>
The emergence of &lsquo; implementation deficits &rsquo; as an analytical problem of the 1970s reflected increasing concern about the limits to government , especially amongst those who adopted a &lsquo; top down &rsquo; perspective .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #41:1>
Other writers , however , subsequently sought to redefine the initial &lsquo; problem &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #42:1>
Crude policy/implementation distinctions were seen as less helpful than notions of the &lsquo; policy/implementation chain &rsquo; ( Hill , 1981 ) or the &lsquo; policy process &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #43:1>
The implementation of much public policy was dependent on action by groups which were relatively autonomous ( street level bureaucrats exercising discretion , professionals ) and where consent had to be mobilised .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #44:1>
A useful review by Barrett and Hill ( 1984 ) argued that not all policy emerged from the top , but could develop in response to a frontline problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #45:1>
Action could therefore predate policy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #46:1>
An alternative model would have to recognise that policy could be ambiguous , often with symbolic , poorly defined or conflicting goals and that policy could emerge during as well as before the implementation process &semi; that implementation should be seen as a policy/action continuum &semi; and that there was a need to focus on the interactions within the process , which included questions of power .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #47:1>
Although organisations need to be seen as negotiated orders , Barrett and Hill also argued that power structures and &lsquo; rules of the game &rsquo; both set parameters within which bargaining took place and were themselves prizes in the bargaining process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #48:1>
From the mid-1970s onwards successive policy initiatives ( such as RAWP ) tried to move the NHS on from policy incrementalism , although in terms of the process of decision making there was as yet no challenge to the bounded pluralist and interest group based model of decision making some saw as enshrined in consensus management .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #49:1>
Securing policy change was as great a topic of research interest as policy maintenance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #50:1>
The study by Dearlove ( 1973 ) of decision making in a local authority painted a world of policy maintenance , where environmental signals were filtered out , where established routines and service provision were rolled forward and where major &lsquo; policy &rsquo; issues rarely arose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #51:1>
Later empirical work in the NHS , on the other hand , sometimes glimpsed ( rare ) exceptions to the picture of policy maintenance ( Hunter , 1980 &semi; Ham , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #52:1>
Recent literature both in the private sector ( Pettigrew , 1985 ) and the public sector has explored further the role of action ( including managerial strategies ) , as opposed to formal systems , in processing policy im<l>plementation ( Korman and Glennerster , 1985 &semi; Hardy , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #53:1>
National policy initiatives , sustained retrenchment , &lsquo; scandals &rsquo; and changing models of professional practice stand out as possible sources of change .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #54:1>
The general picture , however , is one of policy maintenance and of incrementalism , with rapid policy change taking place only under certain limited conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #55:1>
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AIDS AS A NEW ISSUE
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #56:1>
The response of any district to a new issue will be shaped not only by its own approach to decision making , but by the characteristics of the issue which it now has to process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #57:1>
It is not clear , for instance , that &lsquo; necessity is the mother of invention &rsquo; as responses to changing disease patterns can be heavily shaped by the values of health care decision makers which determine how new issues are received into an organisation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #58:1>
In America , the health care response to Aids in New York , at least initially , was much weaker than in San Francisco , despite the fact that New York had many more cases ( Shilts , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #59:1>
The Aids issue also found it extremely difficult to climb up the federal policy agenda .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #60:1>
The first point is that during the time of the case study disease patterns were only slowly being defined , and knowledge bases were &lsquo; prep<l>aradigmatic &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #61:1>
The first &lsquo; official &rsquo; cases were only recorded in 1983 , although nurses said that they were caring for &lsquo; unofficial &rsquo; cases prior to that date .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #62:1>
In addition , because the district was ahead of the rest of the country in experiencing a very early caseload , it was constantly having to invent new solutions , and could not borrow good practice from elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #63:1>
Hall et al. ( 1975 ) suggest that issues have &lsquo; images &rsquo; which affect the ease with which they are handled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #64:1>
We here consider a number of the dimensions which they identify :
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #65:1>
- Is the issue self contained and hence detached or does it have more systemic repercussions ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #66:1>
The Aids issue should be seen as systemic in nature , affecting preventive , hospital and community care programmes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #67:1>
Indeed , precisely because it cuts across units in this fashion , it could potentially be seen as a core topic for general management .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #68:1>
- Does it take the form of a crisis which may make it easier to short circuit conventional patterns of decision making ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #69:1>
Certainly an initial crisis blew up in 1983 , focusing on concerns about safety , although we also need to ask whether the &lsquo; crisis &rsquo; is real or constructed since epidemics can be seen as social as well as medical events ( Stark , 1977 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #70:1>
Some interest groups may resist the &lsquo; crisis &rsquo; label &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #71:1>
others support it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #72:1>
Yet others have argued on the basis of the American experience that &lsquo; hurried large scale medical efforts &rsquo; may produce their own problems in terms of competition for resources and publications ( Johnson and Murray , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #73:1>
- What is the origin of the issue and how close are the key lobbyists to decision makers ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #74:1>
This is in effect a key &lsquo; power &rsquo; question .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #75:1>
Certainly the Aids issue was able to gather perhaps a surprising degree of national political support amongst ministers ( House of Commons Select Committee on Social Services , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #76:1>
Central political ownership of the issue rose markedly in late 1986 with the formation of the Whitelaw Committee , the announcement of an enhanced public education campaign and the first debate in the House of Commons , with a large bipartisan component .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #77:1>
We know little about how these changing central agendas were constructed , but the ability of clinicians in central London teaching hospitals to lobby , through letters to The Times , links with the Departmental medical advisory machinery , ministerial site visits and the provision of expert advice at a national level may have played an important part .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #78:1>
Doctors are always key power brokers in the NHS , and this case may shed light on some influence mechanisms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #79:1>
- What level of &lsquo; rational &rsquo; information is there to support the claims of lobbyists ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #80:1>
In one sense , there was a high degree of epidemiological uncertainty in the early phases of the Aids issue and caseload projections are still fragile .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #81:1>
Indeed , a &lsquo; projection &rsquo; ( however dubious ) could itself become a tool in the negotiation process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #82:1>
Nevertheless the astute anticipation of the problem by clinicians and the early formation of research teams meant that research results were coming out from as early as 1983 ( Pinching et al. ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #83:1>
An important paper by Cheingsong-Popov et al . ( 1984 ) found a substantial pool of indigenous infection :
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #84:1>
17 per cent of a ( Central London ) cohort of symptomless homosexual men were shown to be antibody positive , 34 per cent of haemophiliacs receiving pooled clotting factors and 1.5 per cent of a group of intravenous drug users .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #85:1>
- Is the issue ideologically neutral or politically charged ( issues may be set in wider social and political contexts ) ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #86:1>
The Aids issue certainly had the potential to arouse strong political passions and mobilise conflicting social movements ( Shilts , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #87:1>
In so far as it was defined politically , that might be expected to weaken governmental support for providing resources to deviant subgroups .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #88:1>
Maintaining a &lsquo; non political &rsquo; public health perspective offered one way round these potential political barriers to change .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #89:1>
We need also to consider the local level where issues are also competing for attention , and some will struggle to rise up the agenda or never get onto the agenda at all if they challenge the position of dominant groups .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #90:1>
There may also be informal assumptions locally about what are the major issues which legitimately soak up time and effort .
<ICE-GB:W2A-014 #91:1>
The case study is able to explore whether there are such local agendas , and if so , how they are defended and challenged .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #1:1>
INTRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #2:1>
The motor and components industries will undergo radical restructuring during the 1990s , and this will have major reper<l>cussions for particular firms and particular regions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #3:1>
This pre<l>sents local and regional authorities in European motor manu<l>facturing regions with many new challenges .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #4:1>
If tackled constructively , however , it also opens up new opportunities for regional and local authorities to play a positive role ( alongside the employers , trade unions , the national governments and the European Commission ) in preparing and planning for the future of the auto industry , as part of the transport needs for a changing Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #5:1>
This paper is intended to provide a frame<l>work within which change in the motor industry , and the impli<l>cations for localities and regions , can be considered. 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #6:1>
RESTRUCTURING OF AUTO PRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #7:1>
Excess Capacity in the 1990s
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #X8:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #X9:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #10:1>
Since the mid 1980s the European market for passenger and commercial vehicles has been growing strongly to reach the highest recorded levels of production and sales in 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #11:1>
In the UK the new car market exceeded the two million mark for the first time in 1987 and sales reached a record level in four suc<l>cessive years between 1985 and 1988 ( Done , 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #12:1>
Throughout Europe the story has been very similar .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #13:1>
However , there is a growing recognition on the part of many motor industry analysts and indeed major motor manu<l>facturers ( The Economist , 1989 &semi; Brown , 1990 &semi; WMEB , 1989 &semi; Poling , 1989 ) , that the current high levels of demand for new vehicles in Europe will not
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #14:1>
The debate now seems centred on the extent to which demand will level off or fall in the early 1990s and whether or not a further surge in demand can be expected towards the middle of the decade .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #15:1>
These market trends must , however , be placed in the context of investment decisions by the industry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #16:1>
The projected slowing demand for new passenger cars in Europe ( a reality in the US in 1989 ) will be occurring at a time when vehicle manufactur<l>ers in Europe , the US and Japan are bringing considerably more capacity on-stream .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #17:1>
In Japan , for example , both Honda and Nissan are planning new plants each capable of manufac<l>turing 240,000 units per year whilst in the UK the new Honda , Nissan and Toyota plants are committed to an output of at least 500,000 per year .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #18:1>
The dramatic increases in capacity planned by the Japanese producers have been paralleled by reinvestment and capacity increases by the US and European auto companies and it is estimated that between 1985 and 1990 European pro<l>duction capacity will have increased by almost 20 per cent - from 11.2 million to 13.2 million units per annum .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #19:1>
Thus the basic problem facing the world motor industry in the 1990s will be an excess of productive capacity - at least in relation to the expected size and composition of the market for motor vehicles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #20:1>
The estimates of potential overcapacity vary considerably &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #21:1>
nine million units per year is anticipated by Ford US , between two and three million units by General Motors and more than one million per year in a recent analysis by the West Midlands Enterprise Board .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #22:1>
In direct response to this key fact , the 1990s will see a further global restructuring of the auto industry , with West and East Europe ( in different ways ) at the centre of the stage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #23:1>
Clearly the issue of excess productive capacity will impact on specific countries in different ways as the major firms refine their com<l>petitive strategies to retain or enhance market share .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #24:1>
The major political changes in Eastern Europe have given a boost to the plans of several of the major manufacturers , such as Fiat , to develop or expand production capacity in Eastern bloc coun<l>tries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #25:1>
This potentially provides ready access to developing mar<l>kets in the longer term ( Brown , 1990 ) , and for the moment at least a source of lower-cost production .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #26:1>
Europe will therefore be the arena for a fiercely competitive battle for dominance of the world auto industry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #27:1>
The American transnational corporations ( Ford , General Motors and Chrysler ) , the Japanese giants ( Nissan , Toyota and Honda specifically ) , and the European &ldquo; National champions &rdquo; includ<l>ing VW , Rover , Fiat and Renault are fighting for dominance or survival .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #28:1>
The problem of global overcapacity will be exacerbated in Europe by four factors in particular : &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #29:1>
A further drive to increase sales and production in Europe by the American-based multi-nationals who face increasing pressure from Japanese &ldquo; transplant &rdquo; factories in a declining US vehicle market .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #30:1>
Chrysler has already started to export from the US to Europe whilst GM has stated its intention to treble exports from the US to all markets in the next three years &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #31:1>
The moves by Nissan , Toyota and Honda to increase produc<l>tion and sales in Europe from their rapidly expanding new car plants in the UK and commercial vehicle ventures in Spain &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #32:1>
Reorganisation between the European national champions , including mergers , takeovers , and joint ventures ( also under<l>taken increasingly with Japanese companies ) to increase their size and access to capital , technology , research and development in order to compete from a position of greater combined strength . &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #33:1>
The additional capacity introduced by the expansion of motor production from East European bases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #34:1>
The Soviet Union , for example , plans to double car production to two million units a year by the late 1990s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #35:1>
While at present the quality problems faced by East European producers are severe and production volumes are low by comparison with Western Europe , there is growing evidence of Western and Japanese firms setting up production in Eastern Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #36:1>
The intense competitive struggle associated with excess pro<l>ductive capacity will take three main forms :
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #37:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #38:1>
A major restructuring of production locations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #39:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #40:1>
A new round of mergers and takeovers and the development of new alliances between motor manufacturers , usually taking the form of joint ventures on specific models or major component developments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #41:1>
3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #42:1>
The establishment of new working practices and new pro<l>duction methods , involving state-of-the-art technologies and new manufacturing strategies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #43:1>
Car Plants on the Move :
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #44:1>
The Relocation of Investment and Production
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #45:1>
Despite the assertion on the part of certain motor industry ana<l>lysts that the issue of overcapacity has been overplayed , it appears inescapable that particular European regions will be winners and others , losers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #46:1>
The winners will be those areas which prove attractive , in plant investment terms , either to the established European motor manufacturers , or to the new play<l>ers ( primarily the Japanese motor producers ) , or to companies like Chrysler who wish to re-establish their European presence in preparation for the completion of the single market in 1992 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #47:1>
The losers will be those areas where plant closures , or , as seems more likely in the 1990s , &ldquo; rationalisations &rdquo; take place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #48:1>
One key point to make is that there is no one strategy being pursued by all the major manufacturers and thus decisions about relocation and investment take different forms across the different companies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #49:1>
For example , Ford 's stated aim is to become the lowest-cost car producer in Western Europe , to increase production by 10-15 per cent and launch three new generation models in the next four years .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #50:1>
This is a response to the fact that Ford 's share of the European market slipped from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent between 1984 and 1988 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #51:1>
Part of Ford 's strategy is to ration<l>alise production with one or two models at each European plant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #52:1>
Ford UK is proposing to relocate Sierra production from Dagenham to Genk in Belgium by 1990 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #53:1>
Dagenham will con<l>centrate solely on the Fiesta , but even with increased produc<l>tion capacity for Fiestas , this is likely to mean the loss of some 500 jobs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #54:1>
In the early 1990s Dagenham 's body and assembly lines will be modernised and the plant will become the only production source for the new high-roof Fiesta van .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #55:1>
However , the total investment on these projects will only reach &pound-sign;165 mil<l>lion mil<l>lion mil<l>lion mil<l>lion - a very small slice of the &pound-sign;1.8 billion capital investment package billion capital investment package billion capital investment package billion capital investment package allocated to the UK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #56:1>
However , the current uncertainty of investment plans , even large-scale ones , is illustrated by Ford 's plans for Bridgend .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #57:1>
Ford proposed capital investment of some &pound-sign;725 million million million million in a new engine plant at Bridgend to produce the next generation of multi-valve , lean-burn petrol engines for the company 's mid<l->range cars in Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #58:1>
This was scheduled to come on stream in the summer of 1991 and to provide an additional 700 jobs , cast<l>ing doubt on the long-term future of the Dagenham engine plant ( West Midlands Enterprise Board , 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #59:1>
Early in 1990 however , Ford announced that this new investment at Bridgend was not now to go ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #60:1>
Rover , the UK 's last remaining independent volume car pro<l>ducer , proposes to end production of the Maestro and Montego in Oxford in the early 1990s with substantial job loss<l>es .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #61:1>
But while Oxford would lose car assembly jobs , Swindon , where the Rover pressings plant is located , will be gaining .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #62:1>
Honda , which has had a collaborative relationship with Rover since 1979 , is to build a &pound-sign;60 million engine plant million engine plant million engine plant million engine plant million engine plant there , and in July 1989 the same firm announced its intention to site a &pound-sign;300 million assembly plant million assembly plant million assembly plant million assembly plant million assembly plant at Swindon to produce some 100,000 cars per year by 1994 with 80 per cent local content .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #63:1>
Another crucial development in the geography of auto plant location has been the decision by Nissan to site a car plant in Washington , Tyne and Wear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #64:1>
The plant produced about 75,000 cars in 1989 and Nissan intends production to be up to 200,000 by 1992-3 and ultimately 400,000 in the late 1990s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #65:1>
Nissan 's goal is to be the UK 's largest exporter of cars to continental Europe by 1992 :
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #66:1>
Spain and Italy are particular targets .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #67:1>
Nissan have also signalled their intention to set up a European design and development facility in the UK , offsetting fears that invest<l>ment in passenger car production in the UK ( and commercial vehicle production in Spain ) would be limited to assembly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #68:1>
Between now and 1992 the company is committed to investing &pound-sign;31 million million million million in its European Technology Centre , split between Cranfield in Bedfordshire and Sunderland .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #69:1>
Similarly wide<l->ranging decisions about investment in existing or new plant by both Japanese and European producers are taking place throughout Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #70:1>
The reorganisation of motor vehicle production affects not only the major assemblers but also their relations with the com<l>plex network of supplier firms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #71:1>
The moves towards so-called &ldquo; just in time &rdquo; production systems ( pioneered by Japanese auto manufacturers and widely copied and adapted by the European and US majors ) , and closer integration of motor manufactur<l>ers and suppliers resulting from this , have a number of major implications for auto component firms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #72:1>
One of the most widely discussed issues concerns the location of supplier firms and , in particular , the extent to which &ldquo; just in time &rdquo; production implies a closer geographical link between motor manufacturer and supplier firms ( Glasmeier and McCluskie , 1987 &semi; Mair et al , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #73:1>
In the US , Japanese producers are appearing to adopt a variety of solutions to this question .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #74:1>
In the UK , proximity of supplier firms appears to be an important locational consider<l>ation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #75:1>
Thus the new Honda assembly site at Swindon and the Toyota plant in Derby will house component firms as well as the main assembly operation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #76:1>
Whether the majority of the supplier firms will be newly established branch plants of , for instance , Japanese or West German firms , or include suppliers relocating from elsewhere in the UK or Europe , remains to be seen .
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #77:1>
The Shape of Things to Come :
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #78:1>
Joint Ventures , Mergers and Takeovers
<ICE-GB:W2A-015 #79:1>
The corporate structure of the European motor industry is altering rapidly , not simply through the process of merger and takeover so evident in the 1980s , but increasingly through the development of joint ventures among the major motor manu<l>facturers , between the motor and key component firms and among the compo<l>nent firms themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #1:1>
DEVELOPING A SYSTEM
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #2:1>
This is an approach to setting up a time-recording system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #3:1>
Formally , this &lsquo; design process &rsquo; will have the following stages : &bullet; define requirements of product ( system ) &bullet; propose solutions &bullet; examine for practicability
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #4:1>
These steps are iterated until an acceptable solution is reached .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #5:1>
First , let us consider some of the questions that a designer of such a system may ask when defining the requirements to see what they reveal about the proper<l>ties of a good time-recording system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #6:1>
Then , consider some of the factors not considered in this approach and the way they affect the results of our time-recording exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #7:1>
Lastly , we show how a time-recording system can be set up in order to avoid these problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #8:1>
Basic questions for a designer
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #9:1>
&bullet; How much information do we want to collect ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #10:1>
As much as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #11:1>
&bullet; What sort of information do we want to collect ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #12:1>
Whatever might be needed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #13:1>
&bullet; How do we get the information ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #14:1>
By asking people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #15:1>
These questions may seem a reasonable approach , even if the answers are questionable !
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #16:1>
However , there are problems with this line of attack .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #17:1>
Each question will be considered in turn before looking at an alternative approach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #18:1>
How much information do we want to collect ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #19:1>
One wants as much information as it is possible to get .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #20:1>
This is not the same as getting as much data as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #21:1>
The first decision to be made is how frequently recordings should be made .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #22:1>
For example , one could record every minute of the operation and gain an enormous amount of data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #23:1>
However , it is unlikely that the computer would be able to process this amount of data in a reasonable time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #24:1>
The best unit of time for activities is highly dependent on the nature of the operations ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #25:1>
but a suggestion is somewhere in the order of half an hour to half a day .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #26:1>
This problem is also related to the problem of how detailed or specific are the requests for each time interval .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #27:1>
This is covered later .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #28:1>
What sort of information do we want to collect ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #29:1>
The sort of information needed may seem obvious at first sight , but on reflection it will become clear that there is a conflict of interests here .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #30:1>
Typically , individual products may be developed as a project , each with a project leader . .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #31:1>
The project leader will want to know how each part of the project is progressing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #32:1>
However , others in the company responsible for long term planning will be more interested in the way each part is developed so that they can compare one project with another and identify the best techniques .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #33:1>
This differ<l>ence in requirements can mean that requests made of the employees are very detailed and specific because each activity needs to be classified under several headings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #34:1>
If activities are classified under different headings , then one may also need frequent recordings because the ending of an activity for a project leader may not be at the same time as the ending of an activity for another manager .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #35:1>
So , separate recordings will be needed for the end of every activity under any classification .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #36:1>
How do we get information ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #37:1>
In the business of collecting data on a regular and frequent basis it would be desirable to have as much analysis as possible done automatically .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #38:1>
So , a codified way of entering data is needed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #39:1>
This creates special problems because some idea is needed of what em<l>ployees are likely to want to record .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #40:1>
This is something of a chicken-and-egg situation !
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #41:1>
A good approach is to draw on the experience of someone who is familiar with most of the business and is likely to know how employees will use the system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #42:1>
Below is suggested a more sophisticated approach to this problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #43:1>
A wider view of the requirements
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #44:1>
The approach given above only tackles some of the problems one may encounter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #45:1>
Basically , it takes no account of the fact that one is asking employees to provide information on a regular basis with little immediate benefit to themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #46:1>
Furthermore , this exercise may even be seen as an unwelcome intrusion into their work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #47:1>
Work has a direct benefit to employees because they can identify it with their personal goals and the goals of the firm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #48:1>
It is possible to take account of all the problems listed above and yet not have a viable system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #49:1>
Using only the guide described above may lead to a &lsquo; techno-centric &rsquo; system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #50:1>
Such systems are described in more detail by Enid Mumford 2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #51:1>
A &lsquo; techno-centric &rsquo; system is one which was considered during design as a technical specifi<l>cation only and was not designed with users in mind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #52:1>
The result is not user-friendly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #53:1>
It is important to note here that whereas the user and customer are usually one and the same person , in a time-recording system they are different .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #54:1>
So , one has to take account of the requirements of two sets of people - the employees ( users ) and the managers ( customers ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #55:1>
The &lsquo; techno-centric &rsquo; system has several consequences for the employees .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #56:1>
Techno-centric systems
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #57:1>
The system may be difficult to use .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #58:1>
If so , making entries will become very tedious , especially if employees do not see the personal benefit of the system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #59:1>
There may be some dissatisfaction with time-recording if this happens .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #60:1>
There are two main ways in which the system may be difficult to use . &bullet; ‚àë
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #61:1>
&bullet; The codes may be difficult to understand because they are difficult to relate to the job , because they are difficult to remember , or because there are too many codes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #62:1>
Indeed , even after much development and rationalization , the initial CADCentre system involved codes with six parts ( fields ) for each time entry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #63:1>
Three fields were specific to a particular project and three were general company fields , each with 33 , 8 and 12 codes giving a total of 3200 codes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #64:1>
This proved to be just too complex .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #65:1>
This effect causes serious problems for the system because the employees may become sloppy in their approach to entering data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #66:1>
One is also likely to see employees &lsquo; making their own interpretations of the bits they do not understand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #67:1>
So , one may receive bad data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #68:1>
&bullet; The system may be difficult to use because insuf<l>ficient time has been spent on developing the operating system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #69:1>
This can make entering data very laborious .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #70:1>
This techno-centric system takes no account of the needs of the users :
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #71:1>
it merely collects data and gives nothing in return .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #72:1>
It is important to provide the employees with feedback .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #73:1>
If there is no feedback then : &bullet; The employee puts in effort with no visible return .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #74:1>
If there is no feedback then : ‚àë There is no incentive to provide good ( accurate ) information .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #75:1>
One may see slackness and different &lsquo; interpretations &rsquo; of the system which are actually ways of minimizing the individual 's effort in filling in the data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #76:1>
If there is no feedback then : ‚àë Inefficient work effort - difficult to detect at the best of times - will be more likely to be concealed as the system takes on an Orwellian aspect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #77:1>
It is important that the employees consider the system as an &lsquo; information retrieval system &rsquo; rather than a &lsquo; policing system &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #78:1>
A revised set of priorities
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #79:1>
If one includes these considerations then one can redefine one 's priorities as follows :
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #80:1>
&bullet; Collect as much information as is justified by a perceived need .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #81:1>
It may prove necessary to educate both users and managers so that they can recognise their requirements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #82:1>
&bullet; Make sure the system is easy to use .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #83:1>
&bullet; Make sure there is feedback .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #84:1>
Application at CADCentre
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #85:1>
At CADCentre , a sophisticated arrangement for imple<l>menting this information system was suggested in an attempt to meet the above requirements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #86:1>
Broadly speaking , the process followed reflected the revised priorities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #87:1>
Requirements
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #88:1>
The most clear need came from project leaders for information about the progress of their projects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #89:1>
Consequently , it was suggested that the problem of understanding codes which could not be related to jobs could be solved by having definitions for each code specific to each group .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #90:1>
However , a secondary need is for company-wide data collection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #91:1>
The facility of the computer can be used to relate definitions which may be different from department to department but actually describe the same process simply by using the same codes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #92:1>
In identifying needs it is important to take account of needs which may appear in the future but have not yet been identified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #93:1>
The design should be open to development .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #94:1>
Ease of use
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #95:1>
In this we aimed to use the full abilities of the computer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #96:1>
It was suggested that time spent on the development of the system would be amply repaid if it made entry of data more speedy for the employee .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #97:1>
The aim was to design the coding system so that one could minimize the amount of data required for each entry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #98:1>
The aim was to use codes that would be easily remembered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #99:1>
It was suggested that definitions should be related to individual departments so that the terms are quickly understood , and that only relevant codes should be revealed to the employees .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #100:1>
These definitions can be easily cross-referenced by computer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #101:1>
It was suggested that the number of codes could be reduced if a &lsquo; bin &rsquo; or X-code was provided for all those jobs which could not be placed under the existing headings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #102:1>
This means that the designer is under no obligation to think of every possibility and so come up with a list far too long .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #103:1>
Feedback
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #104:1>
It is believed that employees and project leaders should receive regular , standard , understandable reports .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #105:1>
These need not be complex and could be a computer printout .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #106:1>
Also , project leaders and employees should have the ability to order their own reports via the computer network .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #107:1>
One idea put forward to encourage use of the system was to allow the employees to report time lost through equipment failure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #108:1>
This is beneficial to all because the company can identify unreliable equipment and the employee now has a clear method of showing that her equipment does need replacement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #109:1>
There should also be feedback to the system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #110:1>
As mentioned earlier , it can be difficult to set up the system because one needs to know the very information one wishes to collect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #111:1>
Information from the system 's operation should be used to develop new codes for activities which have not already been identified , and withdraw codes rarely used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #112:1>
The need for a new code can be easily identified if the &lsquo; bin &rsquo; or X-code is used too frequently , e.g. more than 5% of the time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #113:1>
This last concept is very important because it should allow the system to develop over time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #114:1>
CONCLUSION
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #115:1>
Time-recording systems are very useful .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #116:1>
As an inno<l>vative , high-technology company , CADCentre is adopting these methods in order to control its opera<l>tions and improve its products and methods systematic<l>ally .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #117:1>
However , one should take great care in intro<l>ducing such a system because it has important conse<l>quences for the employees :
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #118:1>
the system is totally dependent on employee goodwill if it is to produce good information .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #119:1>
However , we do know that employees are keen and aware of the benefits of such a system in principle , and that the bulk of the problems encountered are con<l>cerned with the details of a particular system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #120:1>
CADCentre 's employees are used to structured working , but their tolerance to difficulties diminishes as one moves further from the technological targets of the firm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #121:1>
Consequently , companies like CADCentre need to apply the same consideration for the user to their internal administration procedures as they do to the products they sell .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #122:1>
In the particular case of time<l->recording design must take place in a systematic manner which can only be achieved by means of a participative approach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-016 #123:1>

FOREIGN POLICY AND DECISION-MAKERS
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #2:1>
In terms of the successful consummation of foreign policy , there is little to add to what has already been said in chapter 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #3:1>
Given that the ability to mass mobilise a politically integrated national citizenry is a primary power resource in effective foreign policy , identification theory has clearly pointed out how to achieve such a situation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #4:1>
First , there must be successful nation-building .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #5:1>
Second , the mass national public must have foreign policy presented to it in such a way that that foreign policy is perceived to be protecting or enhancing national identity in the face of external threat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #6:1>
The question that does remain to be discussed concerns notions of political responsibility and ethics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #7:1>
It concerns how people in the mass media , politicians and decision-makers behave in relation to international images and to the national identity dynamic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #8:1>
It concerns the responsible and irrespon<l>sible behaviour of media figures , politicians and decision-makers in terms of triggering or calming the national identity dynamic &semi; and could be the subject of further research .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #9:1>
PEACE AND PARADOXES
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #10:1>
What becomes clear from an analysis based in identification theory is the very real and crucial psychological dimension of interna<l>tional relations - a dimension which includes not only leaders and decision-makers , but also the mass national peoples .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #11:1>
In recognising clearly and explicitly the types of communication which may trigger the mobilisation of the mass national citizenry , one can equally clearly prescribe concerning the types of communication which are conducive to international peace .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #12:1>
The point which has first of all to be accepted is the fallacy of the notion that &lsquo; sticks and stones may break our bones , but words will never hurt us &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #13:1>
This is untrue .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #14:1>
Actions and utterances , overt or covert , that can be interpreted as threatening symbols of national identity , do hurt .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #15:1>
They threaten the sense of identity and disturb feelings of psychological security .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #16:1>
Communications which threaten identity always provide the possibility for setting in motion domestic political processes which can overspill into international conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #17:1>
It is unrealistic to expect human nature to change , to expect human<l>ity - overnight , over millennia , ever - to mature and transcend what appears to be one of our most basic bio-sociological drives .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #18:1>
Not satisfying hunger or lust would obviously mean the disappearance of humanity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #19:1>
Equally , not satisfying the identification imperative would also mean no humanity , at least as we know it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #20:1>
Since it would be impossible to alter the essential nature of the animal , our prescriptions , based in identification theory , for a better ordered , more peaceful global society must then be concerned with : ( a ) the communications which affect national identity &semi; or ( b ) the political dynamics entwined with national identity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #21:1>
The communications :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #22:1>
Morgenthau made the cavalier and fallacious suggestion that international conflict was the result of the savage urges of the mass of people , and that peace was the result of the wisdom and wiles of statesmen . 52
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #23:1>
Lord knows how much damage that idiotic statement has done to young ( and old ) minds reading international politics , but its crass stupidity is demonstrated , for example , by thinking back to times before the mass public was involved in interna<l>tional relations , when conflict was mainly , in fact , the preserve of an elite and privileged few .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #24:1>
Historically , the mass of people has mainly not been involved in international conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #25:1>
The age of total war is a recent phenomenon , arguably dating from the Thirty Years War .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #26:1>
Identification theory explicates how the mass public can indeed be mobilised for war , but the causal factor is not an innate urge-to-destroy for its own sake , but a behavioural imperative to defend and enhance identity in the face of an external threat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #27:1>
The crucial and fundamental question then arises :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #28:1>
Who communicates about the threat and for what purposes ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #29:1>
The answer is extremely simple .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #30:1>
It is domestic politicians who communicate about the threat in order to mobilise public support for their own policy and power base .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #31:1>
It is also the mass media who communicate about it in order to mobilise an increased audience .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #32:1>
In terms of effective foreign policy , identification theory has told us that in order to mobilise mass public support behind a particular foreign policy initiative , that initiative must be associated with the defence or enhancement of symbols of national identity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #33:1>
This is merely the theoretical explication of a practical , well-rehearsed political art .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #34:1>
Conversely , if one seeks peaceful coexistence , the prescription is blatantly obvious :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #35:1>
Politicians and mass media communicators should not play upon the national identity dynamic in their utterances .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #36:1>
It is too dangerous a dynamic to be used in the cut and thrust of domestic political competition or as a tool for achieving successful sales or viewing figures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #37:1>
Peaceful coexistence is not , then , simply a matter of controlling intentions , communications and propaganda to other states . 53
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #38:1>
It is also a matter of self-control by domestic actors in their communication with their own constituents .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #39:1>
This is a call for an intelligent and responsible sensitivity to the way in which information concerning international relations can affect the national identity dynamic and , like the sorcerer 's apprentice , unleash forces that get out of control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #40:1>
Is this call for maturity amongst our politicians and communicators naive ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #41:1>
Are the partisan political and commercial benefits of playing the national identity dynamic too great to allow for the consideration of such a sense of responsibility ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #42:1>
I would hope that the lack of responsibility displayed thus far is due , at least in part , to ignorance concerning the structure and dynamics of mobilising national identity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #43:1>
In a perilous nuclear world , it is surely possible for leaders and communicators to appreciate that the benefits which come from manipulating the national identity dynamic are short-term and short<l->sighted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #44:1>
The world is quite simply too dangerous for careless emotive communication .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #45:1>
In the face of nuclear holocaust , not to mention the horrors of contemporary non-nuclear war , it is imperative that a new maturity be achieved in domestic and international communications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #46:1>
It is simply too stupid and too dangerous to continue playing the national identity dynamic game in domestic politics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #47:1>
Equally , the constituents , the mass national citizens themselves , could also display a new maturity in terms of what they actually expect of their leaders and communicators - and what they are prepared to believe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #48:1>
Hope always lies in education and in enlightenment -
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #49:1>
why else are we in this educational business ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #50:1>
The basic propositions of this analysis are not too complex to be stated in simple non-esoteric language :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #X51:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #X52:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #X53:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #X54:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #55:1>
To propose such self-control is surely not naive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #56:1>
It is not safe to overindulge any instinct and , just as the more overt appetites can be controlled for self-interest , so the identity dynamic can also be controlled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #57:1>
First , however , we need the education and insight to acknowledge it , and then the self-discipline to bring it under intelligent control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #58:1>
Paradox 1 :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #59:1>
This , however , leads to the first paradox which must be acknowledged .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #60:1>
The discussion has progressed on the basis that it is mainly the mass national citizenry which is subject to national identifi<l>cation and that the leaders and communicators are somehow separate and above such an .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #61:1>
It has been implied that politicians and communicators are self-consciously manipulating the national identity dynamic for their private purposes whilst being themselves separate from the dynamic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #62:1>
Unfortunately , this is not quite the case .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #63:1>
While some politicians and communicators may identify themselves with some transnational culture , many of them are great patriots .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #64:1>
The political competition to appear more patriotic than one 's competitors is not necessarily a public performance aimed simply at mobilising political support , but is also a manifestation of a genuine identification with the nation-state by the politician .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #65:1>
Unscientifically , it is not difficult to identify those leaders of contemporary states who genuinely experi<l>ence patriotism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #66:1>
These patriotic leaders accept as real , true and good their stances on national interest and their perceptions of external threat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #67:1>
Indeed , in order to enhance their own sense of national identity and for other psychological reasons ( beyond the remit of this thesis ) these leaders may build , encourage and even whip up mass national feeling because they think that such a national feeling is a public good in itself . 54
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #68:1>
Their attitude displays no psychological insight into either themselves or their constituents , and displays no practical political in<l>sight into the genuine dangers for the international political system of such sentiments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #69:1>
They serve a domestic psycho-political game which spills over into a spiral of images of the international system in which competition and conflict is necessarily accepted as the norm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #70:1>
This patriotism amongst political leaders is but a hint of the patriot<l>ism that exists professionally in the armed services .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #71:1>
There is a whole industrial complex and mass of people who are professionally involved in serving national identity and what is interpreted as national interest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #72:1>
Within this psychological gestalt it is axiomatic that the world is divided into competing warrior-states - for , if it were not , these people would have no purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #73:1>
Within the academy of Interna<l>tional Relations , this world-view is accepted and reinforced by students and teachers of Strategy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #74:1>
Let us be clear , though , that a mature attitude to communications about national identity and international threat is possible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #75:1>
In Scandinavia , after centuries of conflict , Swedish and Norwegian leaders deliberately chose to seek a path of friendship and cooperation - and disciplined their communications consistently . 55
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #76:1>
This is perfectly normal where an alliance is agreed and considered necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #77:1>
Western Europe since 1945 displays generally such a maturity in its interstate communications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #78:1>
It may be that such a maturity has been achieved in the face of a perceived common threat from the East , but the nature of motivation should not detract from the fact that western European states have been capable of so ordering their affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #79:1>
Equally , when it is deemed appropriate for the United States to have friendly com<l>munications with the People 's Republic of China , a new mature form of communication was employed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #80:1>
Similarly after Sadat 's visit to Israel , there was care in the communications between Egypt and Israel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #81:1>
All this is to say that it is not idealistic to ask for such a maturity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #82:1>
The problem lies in extending this maturity , based in self-interest , from specific international relationships to all international relationships .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #83:1>
One needs to be clear , though , that as there will always be renegade states , this is not a call for a passive and duped universal foreign policy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #84:1>
It is a call for discretion towards the international environment and for an end to appropriating apparent conflicts with stereotyped enemies for the domestic political game .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #85:1>
This appropriation is essentially dishonest and can have dire consequences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #86:1>
This is a call for a more mature leadership , a more mature media and a more mature con<l>stituency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #87:1>
This requires also a mature democracy in which open discussion concerning the illusory quality of external threat is accepted as a normal aspect of everyday political discourse - and not as potential treachery subject to threats and constraints .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #88:1>
Political structure :
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #89:1>
What has also become clear from the analysis based in identification theory are the profound dangers which come from joining the nation with the state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #90:1>
Once a cultural , therefore psychologi<l>cal , community becomes concordant with a political system , that political system takes a quantum leap from being a purely functional power entity into being a psycho-political entity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #91:1>
The state in which there has been successful nation-building can draw on that most basic of its power resources , the psychological attachment of its people .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #92:1>
Certainly , from a viewpoint based purely in analysing domestic state interests , this is a good and necessary thing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #93:1>
Perceived from a paradigm beyond that of domestic interest , it has created a dangerous and volatile entity - dangerous and volatile because that mass psycho<l>logical attachment , based in identification , is prey to all the manipula<l>tion and propaganda of irresponsible domestic political competition and media interests .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #94:1>
In the previous section , I called for a maturity amongst politicians and communicators , but why call for that maturity when , possibly , a different form of political arrangement could remove the dangerous toy from the children 's hands in the first place ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #95:1>
What is being sug<l>gested here is the disengagement of national culture from polity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-017 #96:1>
One is looking to the dismantling of the ideology that each nation should have its state and all the implicit political prescriptions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #1:1>
Accident Reporting Systems
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #2:1>
Major disasters and dramatic incidents quickly hit the media , but these form only a tiny proportion of all accidents the HSE learns about .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #3:1>
In Britain , any accident occurring at or in connection with work , and resulting in three or more days ' incapacity , is reportable to the HSE .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #4:1>
In addition , there are several specific categories of injury that are reportable regardless of how many days ' incapacity result .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #5:1>
These include certain eye injuries , electrical injuries requiring medical attention , loss of consciousness due to lack of oxygen , and any injury resulting in twenty-four hours or longer in hospital ( RIDDOR , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #6:1>
Additional considerations apply in particular areas :
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #7:1>
for example , the Railways ( Notice of Accidents ) Order 1986 applies to statutory railways , and virtually all reported railway accidents are reported under this Order .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #8:1>
In this way a very wide net is cast .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #9:1>
A rich source of information on accidents occurring is available to the inspectorates of the HSE .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #10:1>
This is in sharp contrast with the practice of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration ( OSHA ) in the USA , where only fatalities and catastrophies catastrophes ( FATCATS ) are reportable to OSHA area offices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #11:1>
( Catastrophies Catastrophes are incidents involving five or more victims admitted to hospital . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #12:1>
Up to March 1983 , the bulk of accident reports in Britain came to the inspectorates indirectly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #13:1>
By agreement with the DHSS , copies of any forms claiming sickness benefit that appeared to arise from an industrial accident ( or illness ) were , in due course , forwarded to an HSE area office .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #14:1>
The forms ( &lsquo; B176s &rsquo; √≠ ) provided a sketchy description of the accident and characteristics of the victim .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #15:1>
In the Factory and Agricultural Inspectorates , computer codes for type and agency of accident , type of injury , etc. , were derived from these by clerical staff and stored on the computer system known as &lsquo; SHIELD &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #16:1>
The forms were also scanned by an inspector ( usually , but not always , a senior inspector ) and a decision made whether or not to send an inspector to investigate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #17:1>
In addition to this roundabout ( and now defunct ) system , major accidents and fatalities were and are directly reportable by employers to the Inspectorate as soon as possible by telephone , with a follow-up written report .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #18:1>
This system officially ceased at the end of March 1983 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #19:1>
Under new regulations , which came into effect in 1986 , all reports are to be made directly to the relevant enforcing agency within seven days , but major accidents must be reported by telephone as soon as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #20:1>
Railway accidents have always been reported directly to the Railway Inspectorate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #21:1>
Certain particularly serious categories of accident are reported directly to Inspecting Officers by telephone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #22:1>
These include any accidents to passenger trains involving fatal or serious injury to passengers or train crews and any fatal accident at a level crossing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #23:1>
In addition , any particularly serious accident involving a freight train and any incident causing major disruption to a main line would also be reported directly by telephone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #24:1>
The only fatalities to the public not to be reported immediately are suicides and trespassers to the railway .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #25:1>
In contrast to the Factory Inspectorate , fatalities to railway staff need not be reported by telephone unless a single incident has resulted in multiple fatalities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #26:1>
Other more minor accidents involving railway employees and passengers are reported directly to the Inspectorate on a monthly basis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #27:1>
It is worth noting that important filters operate before an inspector receives notification that an accident has occurred , especially in relation to less serious injuries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #28:1>
Someone has already defined the incident as a notifiable accident , and constructed the available information into some kind of brief report .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #29:1>
On the basis of this already filtered and framed information the inspector takes a decision whether to respond with an investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #30:1>
The process of defining what has happened and how to respond is well advanced before any investigation is carried out .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #31:1>
Although there are some variations between inspectorates of the HSE in the regulations applying to notification of accidents that fall within their authority , much greater differences arise in the ways in which the inspectorates respond to the reports they receive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #32:1>
The Mines and Quarries Inspectorate , for example , investigates only major accidents , and it investigates all of them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #33:1>
The Factory , Agricultural , and Railway Inspectorates investigate across the whole range of reported accidents .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #34:1>
Out of a sample of 232 accidents investigated by the FI in 1982-3 , 73 per cent were non-major , reported through the indirect B176 system via the DHSS , while 26 per cent were reported directly as major accidents ( see also Table 2 above ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #35:1>
Before we discuss the functions of investigations , we will look briefly at how the FI makes the selection of accidents for investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #36:1>
This selection implies that a visit ( or possibly several visits ) will be made by an inspector , and a written report made of what is found and what action is taken .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #37:1>
Accident reports may be followed up in other ways -
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #38:1>
for example , a telephone call may be made to the establishment to clarify what happened &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #39:1>
the establishment may be asked to forward its own report to the Factory Inspectorate &semi; or a note may be left on the establishment file for follow-up at the next visit .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #40:1>
The Decision to Investigate
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #41:1>
While the B176 system was operating , approximately 4 per cent of accidents reported to the FI were selected for investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #42:1>
Written guidelines for factory inspectors provide a basic list of the various factors to be taken into account in making this selection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #43:1>
For some categories of accident the guidelines specify that investigation is mandatory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #44:1>
These include fatalities , very serious injuries , and multiple casualties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #45:1>
When investigation is optional the factors that according to the guidelines , may influence the decision to investigate include whether a serious breach of the law is indicated &semi; recurring accidents at a particular factory &semi; and accidents to young people or children .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #46:1>
Empirical data from our research confirm that the factors listed in the guidelines do indeed affect inspectors ' decisions to investigate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #47:1>
Comparison between accidents selected and accidents rejected reveal clear patterns of choice , reflecting the seriousness of the injury , and whether a breach of regulations is apparent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #48:1>
These patterns were confirmed by interviews with inspectors about how they make the selection , and by getting inspectors to talk aloud as they actually made the selection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #49:1>
In addition , certain types of accidents ( such as explosions ) or accidents at certain classic dangerous machines ( such as horizontal milling machines ) , tend to be investigated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #50:1>
A major consideration is whether or not the inspector anticipates that some action can be taken as a result of the investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #51:1>
For this reason , quite serious injuries may not be investigated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #52:1>
For example , finger amputations are frequently not investigated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #53:1>
When asked why , inspectors said that there is usually little action an inspector can take following a finger amputation on woodworking machinery ( except perhaps where the victim is a young trainee ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #54:1>
Similarly , a broken limb caused by slipping in a car park is unlikely to be investigated by the Factory Inspectorate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #55:1>
As a rule inspectors reject for investigation accidents where little can be done :
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #56:1>
but significant exceptions are those accidents where there is a public expectation that the inspectorate will respond .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #57:1>
Lengthy investigations often follow fatal accidents even if it was apparent early on that there was little the inspector could do as the victim had made a fatal mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #58:1>
For the Agricultural Inspectorate in particular , accident reports can also be an important source of information about new agricultural machinery , especially imported machinery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #59:1>
Accident reports may be the first way that Agricultural Inspectors are made aware of the presence of hazardous machinery , possibly failing to comply with safety standards .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #60:1>
If accidents appear to involve newly introduced machinery that fact may therefore be a reason for investigating .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #61:1>
Similar factors determine which accidents the Railway Inspectorate investigate , although in the case of this Inspectorate the situation is complicated by the various types of investigation available .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #62:1>
Railway Inspectors can investigate accidents either under the 1871 Regulation of Railways Act or under the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #63:1>
While most investigations are now undertaken under the latter , there is a strong preference to hold Inquiries under the 1871 legislation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #64:1>
This is partly a result of public expectation , but is principally because of the opportunities the 1871 legislation affords for publishing the findings of the investigations and disseminating information about accidents and their causes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #65:1>
The Health and Safety at Work Act , by comparison , imposes constraints on publication .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #66:1>
Unless the Secretary of State decides to appoint a member of the legal profession to conduct a formal Inquiry , the decision to hold an Inquiry is made at RI headquarters , either after an inspector has held a preliminary investigation or after the railway have conducted their own initial inquiry and provided a report .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #67:1>
Account is taken of such factors as whether or not there was either actual serious injury or death or the potential for these &semi; the degree of public interest in the accident &semi; whether or not passenger trains are involved &semi; whether or not the causes of the accident are known &semi; how unusual the circumstances of the accident are &semi; and whether or not non-compliance is suspected .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #68:1>
If the accident is especially worrying in any of these respects , it may be decided to hold a public hearing of the evidence under the 1871 legislation ( see below ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #69:1>
Investigation
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #70:1>
The decision to investigate an accident almost always implies that a visit by an inspector will be made to carry out an on-site investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #71:1>
The inspector making the visit could be anything from a trainee to a principal inspector .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #72:1>
( Indeed , the accident may be selected for investigation largely because of the value to trainees of investigating a range of accidents . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #73:1>
A handful of less serious accident investigations fall by the wayside before a visit is made because of the time that has elapsed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #74:1>
For all the inspectorates we studied , &lsquo; accident investigation &rsquo; is a class of visit in itself .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #75:1>
However , an investigation is often combined with other activities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #76:1>
Thus , an inspector may use the same visit to check on other matters already known about , or to conduct a full basic inspection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #77:1>
About 5 per cent of Factory Inspectorate investigations bring the inspector to premises not previously registered with the HSE .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #78:1>
Investigating the accident may then be secondary to impressing on the employer the requirement to register , and finding out more about the previously unknown and uninspected establishment that has been brought to light .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #79:1>
The investigation itself obviously takes varying lengths of time and may be conducted in a variety of ways , depending on the particular accident .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #80:1>
It would , of course , be usual for the inspector to look at the site of the accident and interview any witnesses or other members of the workforce or management with relevant information ( for example , about usual work practices &semi; safety measures taken before and since the accident &semi; other similar machines in use ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #81:1>
As a general rule , the more serious the accident the more time will be devoted to its investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #82:1>
Following a fatal accident the inspector will be making a report to the Coroner .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #83:1>
In addition , there will be a strong expectation that the inspectorate will make a thorough investigation and it will need to be seen to do so , even if it is clear from a fairly early stage in the investigation that there is little more to be learnt .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #84:1>
Closely linked with the seriousness of the accident is the action that the inspector anticipates taking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #85:1>
If it appears from the initial accident notification that a breach of regulations has resulted in a serious injury there is a strong possibility that prosecution will be considered ( see further below ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #86:1>
Once an inspector anticipates a possible prosecution , his or her approach to investigation necessarily becomes more formal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #87:1>
Statements need to be taken , and evidence assembled with an eye to the possibility that it may be presented in court .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #88:1>
The investigation is not only more formal but also more time-consuming , and the urgency of collecting evidence before it is lost may mean that the investigation is carried out as a priority .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #89:1>
Once an inspector has concluded the investigation , a written report will be prepared outlining the findings of the investigation , any action taken , and any further action intended or recommended ( such as prosecution ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #90:1>
The investigation report itself may simply disappear into a filing cabinet .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #91:1>
However , the information gathered at investiga<l>tions may be directed into a number of channels feeding into policy at some level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #92:1>
A very effective use of accident information can be through National Industry Groups ( NIGs ) within the Factory Inspectorate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #93:1>
NIGs are part of the organization of Area Offices and staffed by field-level inspectors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #94:1>
Each NIG keeps an eye on a particular industry - such as chemicals , engineering , steel - providing a national focus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #95:1>
If it appears that an accident has wider implications that should be communicated to the industry or to inspectors dealing with the industry , the relevant NIG provides a channel for doing so .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #96:1>
For example , in the course of our study an accident occurred at a wire-drawing machine , wrapping wire many times around a worker 's hand causing such serious injury that the hand had to be amputated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #97:1>
Such an accident had not , in the inspector 's experience , occurred before at that type of machine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-018 #98:1>
Details of the accident and investigation were therefore passed to the wire rope and cable NIG .

<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #1:1>
THE URBAN/RURAL DIVIDE
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #2:1>
Latin American countries have long been ruled by small urbanized &eacute;lites who treat all the problems of their respective countries as if they were those of the capital and its environs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #3:1>
In 1983 40 per cent of Uruguayans lived in Montevideo , 37.3 per cent of Chileans in Santiago , 34.1 per cent of Argentines in Buenos Aires and each of these countries , like Venezuela , was three-quarters urbanized .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #4:1>
Also heavily urbanized was Mexico , with 20.1 per cent of Mexicans living in the capital region , which is generally regarded now as the world 's largest city .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #5:1>
Though Bolivia , Costa Rica , the Dominican Republic , Ecuador , El Salvador , Guatemala , Haiti , Honduras , Nicaragua , Panama and Paraguay retained a rural majority in their population , the same trends were already noticeable in several of these less-developed states .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #6:1>
In the twenty-first century the urban population will continue to grow and the problems of overurbanization will increase alongside the continuing spectre of rural poverty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #7:1>
In 1980 censuses gave Brazil a population of 119 million , Mexico 67 million , Argentina 28 million and Colombia 26 million .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #8:1>
For the size of the countries concerned these figures did not yet give rise to alarm -
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #9:1>
indeed many Latin American politicians still continue to welcome population growth both as a sign of their own virility and as the only natural resource that increases spontaneously .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #10:1>
Between 1970 and 1980 , however , population increased at least as fast as in the United States in all Latin American countries except Uruguay .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #11:1>
Social attitudes , such as the desire for insurance in one 's old age , encourage this .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #12:1>
So too does the teaching of the dominant Catholic Church .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #13:1>
Though artificial contraception is already practised widely among the middle classes , the Church continues to denounce all forms of contraception other than the &lsquo; rhythm method &rsquo; , and the technical term for people who rely on that is &lsquo; parents &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #14:1>
Hence , the slowest rates of growth ( Uruguay 0.4 , Argentina 1.6 and Chile 1.7 per cent per annum ) occurred in the wealthier states and the fastest rates were found in the poorer states .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #15:1>
Moreover , some were very rapid indeed : Nicaragua growing at 3.7 per cent and Ecuador and Venezuela 3.4 per cent per annum .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #16:1>
This means that on all demo<l>graphic precedents the problem of rapidly growing populations is going to be a problem for Latin America well into the new century .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #17:1>
Some 48 per cent of Nicaraguans or Hondurans , and 45 per cent of Mexicans are under the age of 15 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #18:1>
Although by the year 2010 this last figure is expected to drop to around 30 per cent , this will only be because the population of older people is expected to increase and not because there is any expectation that those who are in their early 20s then will be limiting the size of their families .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #19:1>
In fact in many other countries the figures then will look much the same as they do today .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #20:1>
This means that not only , by the standards of the developed countries , will a relatively small number of mature workers continue to have to provide the economic basis for public programmes of housing , education , health care , social services and welfare , but the countries concerned will be hard put even to find work for those .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #21:1>
Here too the trends are not encouraging as regards the future of the smaller states .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #22:1>
As Table 7.3 shows , the distribution of the labour force in the larger countries already shows a recognizably &lsquo; modern &rsquo; profile , with relatively few people engaged in primary production and a relatively large number in secondary manufacturing industry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #23:1>
Argentina and Uruguay are the most striking examples .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #24:1>
But there are warning signs even here .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #25:1>
Cuba , despite strenuous efforts to modernize , still has a much larger proportion of its working population engaged in primary production than the countries on which it seeks to model itself .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #26:1>
And Chile , while retaining a rather large primary sector , has an extra<l>ordinarily large proportion of its population employed in the tertiary services sector .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #27:1>
Like Argentina , and , to a slightly lesser extent Uruguay , it resembles in this last respect a modern developed economy such as that of the United States , but without the base of manufacturing industry which would enable it to maintain the level of production and exports that has traditionally been required to support it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #28:1>
The fact that other developed countries such as Britain are going down the same road is not a sign of health in these economies , rather the reverse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #29:1>
The outlook for the twenty-first century , then , is that these larger economies will continue to have difficulty in maintaining their relative position in the world unless some way is found either of expanding production or reducing expectations still further .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #30:1>
As regards the smaller economies , the picture is even more bleak .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #31:1>
In Bolivia , the Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras and Paraguay half of the working population , in Haiti three-quarters , are still engaged in primary production .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #32:1>
Their future depends on their closeness to subsistence level , the unpredictable chances of flood , storm or earthquake , and on the unpredictable demands of the world market .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #33:1>
Manufacturing , too , is closely geared to the needs of the primary sector and shares its problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #34:1>
The economies are too small to supply a large range of products now universally sought and desired , so these have to be imported , at great cost relative to the money earned by the primary sector .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #35:1>
And in both large and small countries the table tells us nothing of the numbers in work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #36:1>
All suffer from high levels of unemployment and underemployment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #37:1>
Unemployment statistics in Latin America are notoriously in<l>accurate and little is known outside the major cities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #38:1>
Santiago de Chile , Bogot&aacute; , Caracas and Montevideo all have high levels of unemploy<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #39:1>
Estimates of the numbers of Mexicans unemployed ranged from 6 to 18 million at the beginning of 1988 and by the year end had risen substantially , probably to over 20 million of the estimated 80 million population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #40:1>
Only those in the state-sponsored union sector enjoyed anything resembling adequate social security .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #41:1>
As adults , all Cubans and , more surprisingly , 96.3 per cent of Brazilians are covered by some measure of social security , but in the Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Guatemala and Honduras well under 10 per cent and in Haiti under 1 per cent enjoy any degree of protection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #42:1>
Here too their exposure to the bracing effect of market forces has brought not prosperity , but misery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #43:1>
Some of the consequences can be foreseen easily enough .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #44:1>
The primary sector in all cases is too large and is unable to absorb the growing population of working age .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #45:1>
Young men and women will therefore have to seek work elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #46:1>
Migrants will continue to flock to capitals ( and a few major provincial cities ) in search of work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #47:1>
They will leave behind in the countryside an aging population who will find it increasingly difficult to provide the necessary food for the burgeoning urban population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #48:1>
They will find when they arrive horrendous problems of housing , food , sanitation and health .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #49:1>
Their entrepre<l>neurial skills will be tested to the full as they occupy themselves with all manner of marginal and largely unproductive bits of jobs to try to make a living for themselves and their growing families .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #50:1>
They will find great difficulty in making their wants known to those in authority , as the middle classes , striving to keep up their standard of living by doing two or even three jobs at a time , defend their relatively privileged positions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #51:1>
Yet with radio universal and television blanketing all major centres of population in the region the majority of Latin Americans now have the opportunity to compare their conditions directly with those of the developed states , and it would be strange indeed if after a glimpse of life in a Los Angeles penthouse apartment they did not find their own living conditions squalid and inadequate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #52:1>
QUALITY OF LIFE
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #53:1>
Figures for the region as a whole show a marked discrepancy between expectation of life at birth in the larger wealthier states and the smaller poorer ones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #54:1>
Though there are some anomalies , such as the astonish<l>ing number of Venezuelans ( 11.8 per cent ) who die in accidents or Guatemalans who are victims of homicide ( 11.2 per cent ) , the usual reason for low expectation of life at birth is that far too many babies die before they reach the age of one expressed per thousand live births ( infant mortality rate or IMR ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #55:1>
The US in 1983 had an IMR of 10.5 and this like rates in Western Europe had continued to fall .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #56:1>
Cuba 's rate , the lowest reported in Latin America , was 25.6 &semi; Bolivia 's , the highest , was 124.4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #57:1>
A high IMR is commonly caused by poor nutrition , poor hygiene and inadequate medical services .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #58:1>
Though in Bolivia 's case high altitude and cold also play a part , among the other countries in the region the three main factors show a striking consistency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #59:1>
In Argentina , at one end of the scale , the daily calorie intake is 3195 , compared with 3647 for the United States , and only some 8 per cent of the population is undernourished , though the National Food Programme is now needed to ensure that food is available .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #60:1>
Most houses have piped water and a proper toilet .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #61:1>
There are 26.7 physicians for every thousand population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #62:1>
The IMR is low and adult Argentines tend to die of the diseases of an affluent society like the United States or Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #63:1>
The commonest causes of death are heart disease ( 31.9 per cent ) and malignant cancers ( 17.6 per cent ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #64:1>
By almost all standard measures Haiti , the poorest country of the region , stands at the opposite pole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #65:1>
The average daily calorie intake is only 1901 - a figure which is dangerously near the minimum necessary to sustain life - and 90 per cent of the population is undernourished .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #66:1>
Few houses have piped water or a proper toilet .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #67:1>
There are only 1.2 physicians per thousand population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #68:1>
The IMR is high and , as in Guatemala , El Salvador and even Mexico , adults still die of the diseases of poverty : enteritis , diarrhoea and other infectious and parasitic diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #69:1>
The irony is , of course , that virtually all of these can now be cured if adequate medical services are available .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #70:1>
Instead , it seems that relying on the free market in health may have brought nemesis on those who deny the right of all to health and trust to the impersonal forces of the market to protect them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #71:1>
The motto of the market is &lsquo; Let the buyer beware &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #72:1>
Tragically , Haiti suffers uniquely from the terrible scourge of AIDS , and AIDS , some believe , reached the United States from there as a result of the abhorrent trade in blood products , by which medical corporations have induced poverty-<l>stricken Haitians to sell blood and even parts of their bodies to stay alive while saving the lives of the inhabitants of the world 's richest country .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #73:1>
In the twenty-first century medical science will have to be brought on a large scale to the inhabitants of the poorer countries of the region if the inhabitants of the richer ones are to benefit fully from modern developments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #74:1>
Prevention is better than cure and it is all too seldom realized that the demographic explosion in nineteenth-century Europe began with improved hygiene and was well under way before Lister had discovered antiseptics or Pasteur and Koch the bacteria that cause disease .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #75:1>
International programmes have eliminated smallpox but yellow fever , once the scourge of the sailors of tropical America and now , though much rarer , still endemic in tropical South and Central America , has yet to follow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #76:1>
Public spending on a vast scale is still needed in many parts of Latin America on the essential but un<l>spectacular necessities of pure water , efficient waste disposal and mass immunization against unnecessary killers such as diptheria diphtheria , measles and tuberculosis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #77:1>
All Latin American countries fall short of the United States in terms of quality of life , that indeterminate quality that summarizes the life chances offered by the society to the individual .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #78:1>
Those that come nearest are Argentina , Costa Rica , Cuba and Uruguay .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #79:1>
In Argentina the middle and upper classes make up 38 per cent of the population &semi; in Uruguay 35 per cent , as against 14 per cent for the El Salvador of the &lsquo; fourteen Families &rsquo; and 12 per cent for Guatemala under military occupation by its own armed forces .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #80:1>
Virtually every child of primary school age in Argentina , as in Chile , Costa Rica or Cuba , is enrolled in school and children there have a one-in-three chance of passing through to tertiary education .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #81:1>
In Argentina , only 4.5 per cent of those over the age of 15 are unable to read and write &semi; in Cuba 4.6 per cent , and Chile 5.6 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #82:1>
At the other end of the scale , over 40 per cent of Haitians lack even primary education and over 60 per cent are illiterate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-019 #83:1>
Thus the gulf between opportunities for youth in the rich and the poor countries continues to grow .

<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #2:1>
The global level
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #3:1>
As originally formulated ( King , 1976 : 26-8 ) , this level of analysis concerns cognitive phenomena and , in the metropolitan society , covers the processes by which knowledge and assumptions about urban systems in the colonial and ex-colonial societies are derived by members of the metropolitan .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #4:1>
( In the colonial society , it concerns the transfer of urban-planning theories from the metropolitan core to the colonial periphery , i.e. theories derived from one mode of production and transplanted to the territory of another . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #5:1>
Under contemporary global capitalism , this level covers , in the academic and professional sphere , knowledge and theory about , for example , world urban systems , world cities , globalization , global restructuring , i.e. knowledge that may influence decisions about urban development and planning .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #6:1>
In the popular sphere it refers to knowledge of Third- or First-World cities used by the inhabitants of each to make comparisons between them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #7:1>
This level is also appropriate for discussing global electronic communications , investment flows , etc .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #8:1>
The international level
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #9:1>
Imperialism and colonialism 1 are manifest in innumerable forms in the metropolitan capital .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #10:1>
The imperial and colonial control function ( to use Friedmann 's ( 1986 ) phrase ) are not only &lsquo; directly reflected in the structure and dynamics of their production sectors and employ<l>ment &rsquo; but also in the city 's huge size , institutions , economic , social , and cultural composition as well as in its built environment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #11:1>
Whilst this is discussed at greater length in Chapter 5 on London , mention may be made here of those particular attributes of the metropolitan capital resulting directly from its role of control , i.e. institutions of government ( the Colonial Office , India Office , and the Foreign and ( especially ) Commonwealth Office ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #12:1>
financial and commercial sectors that benefit disproportionately from the inter<l>national investment and related functions of the colonial connection ( banks , insurance , shipping offices , docks , and many related industries ( West India Docks , East India Docks , etc . ) ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #13:1>
commercial and residen<l>tial property developed from colonially derived investments and surpluses &semi; retailing establishments dealing in colonial goods or catering for colonial populations ( Whiteley 's , Army and Navy Stores , etc . ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #14:1>
shipping , travel and despatch agencies &semi; a variety of educational , scien<l>tific , and cultural institutions associated with the appropriation , development , and reconstitution of colonial cultures and societies ( e.g. Imperial College of Science and Technology , the School of Oriental and African Studies , the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , the Tropical Products Institute , India Office Library , the Royal Colonial Institute , the Royal Asiatic Society ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #15:1>
various missionary and religious headquarters , particular museums and research institu<l>tions , &lsquo; dominion agencies &rsquo; for Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the Crown Colonies , the South African Colonies , the Malay Straits , etc. , for controlling the flow of international labour migration and settle<l>ment ( as well as offices of the Canadian Pacific Railway ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #16:1>
Such institutions ( and economic , social , and occupational structures that relate to them ) become especially evident when the city is compared either to imperial capitals with similar functions ( e.g. Paris and Amsterdam ) , to colonial capitals initially without such institutions ( Delhi and Algiers ) , to other metropolitan cities with mainly commer<l>cial or industrial functions ( e.g. Manchester and Birmingham ) or to other non-colonial national capitals ( e.g. Oslo and Athens ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #17:1>
In sum , everything concerning the size , population , institutions , and requirements of an imperial capital are inflated far in excess of what the metropolitan society on its own , either requires or , without the tribute from the empire , can economically support .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #18:1>
The success of economic colonization inflates in particular the monetary economy of the metropolitan capital , and hence , its banking function , far beyond the requirements of the local population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #19:1>
Whilst such institutions have their historic origins in colonialism , they are frequently the antecedents of contemporary internationally directed and `development'-oriented activities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #20:1>
They are a prerequisite for the development of the institutional and professional infrastruc<l>ture of the world city and are critical for establishing its ideological and cultural role .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #21:1>
This level of analysis , then , deals with the integrated ensemble of functions , activities , and institutions determined by the role of the city in the prevailing mode of production .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #22:1>
Studies of particular sectors or institutions in the city are referred to on pp. 64-6 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #23:1>
In examining the impact of global capitalism on urbanization and urban development , this is obviously the level of world-city analysis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #24:1>
This focuses both on the production sectors and employment as well as their functional institutions that , while present in core world cities ( Hall , 1984 ) are not located elsewhere in the cities of the periphery or semi-periphery ( Cohen , 1981 ) : the multinational headquarters offices , international institutions , international banks , commodity and stock exchanges , producer-service concentrations , cultural - and media-production centres , as well as the ancillary services dependent on them such as hotels , restaurants , the police and security services , entertain<l>ment , etc .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #25:1>
The national ( and regional ) levels
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #26:1>
This level focuses on the national urban system , the characteristics of urbanization and urban development as influenced by a colonial mode of production in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries and global capitalism in the late-twentieth century .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #27:1>
With regard to colonialism , the original formulation ( King , 1976 : 29 ) referred to particular urban areas , such as industrial regions and ports ( e.g. Glasgow and Liverpool ) , primarily dependent on the import and manufacture of colonially derived raw materials &semi; land and property development resulting from the investment of resources derived from colonial trading &semi; and in terms of residential use , selected towns and semi-rural areas ( e.g. resorts and spas and the &lsquo; Home Counties &rsquo; ) preferred as residential locations by returned colonial expatriates , or benefitting by their patronage ( i.e. in providing educational facilities for their children ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #28:1>
Also included is the port-oriented transport system , geared to the colonial economy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #29:1>
Seen in a larger context , this level concentrates on those parts of the total colonial space economy located in Britain and specializing in and dependent on the processing , manufacture , and shipment of colonially derived raw materials and also dependent on colonial markets .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #30:1>
Both the colonial and metropolitan ports grow together : but in the metropolis , colonialism leads especially to the development of nearby port-related industrial areas exporting to the colonies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #31:1>
This level also covers those areas benefitting from colonially derived investment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #32:1>
Whilst this issue requires much further investigation two examples can serve as an illustration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #33:1>
The most obvious is the earlier reference to the so-called Lancashire &lsquo; cotton towns &rsquo; and the Indian subcontinent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #34:1>
Here , particular localities processed raw cotton grown in India , Egypt ( and earlier , the southern states of the USA ) , the export market for which was overwhelmingly in India and particularly , Bengal ( now Bangladesh ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #35:1>
Subsequently , the connection along this particular line in the spatial division of labour continues in the production and export of textile machinery for the Indian economy ( Simmons and Kirk , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #36:1>
Other examples in the early part of the twentieth century include West Yorkshire textile towns dependent on wool imports from Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa and equally dependent for exports on Canada and Australia &semi; the dependence of the Midlands manufacturing industry ( locomotives , machinery , etc . ) on export markets in India , South Africa , and South America , or of ports , such as Glasgow and Liverpool on processing products ( tobacco and sugar ) from the Caribbean , or on shipping lines serving imperial routes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #37:1>
The distinction to be made here is between regionally based industries and towns that operate in the full , open competition of world markets , and others ( such as those mentioned ) that not only operate within the politically and economically protected circumstances of colonialism but , by doing so , become locked into production forms aimed at the lower level of economic development that prevails in colonial societies. 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #38:1>
As the political ties dissolve with independence , economic growth occurs in the ex-colony at the expense of the particular locality in the metropolitan economy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #39:1>
Yet , as the colonial mode of production is replaced by harsher competition from other parts of the world<l->economy , structural , historical , and cultural ties continue :
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #40:1>
immigrant labour from low-income Asian countries is recruited to the same textile regions in order to lower production costs for a global market .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #41:1>
Performing a different function are those localities that benefit disproportionately from colonially derived investment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #42:1>
These may be particular towns and semi-rural areas ( e.g. resorts , spas , &lsquo; the Home Counties &rsquo; ) , favoured as residential locations by returned colonial ex<l>patriates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #43:1>
Whilst little research has been undertaken on this phenomenon ( cf. King , 1976 : 29 ) , one example is significant in illustrating the continuity in the roles of particular localities in both the old and the new international division of labour .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #44:1>
It demonstrates the colonial foundations of the internationally restructured contem<l>porary urban system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #45:1>
In the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century , &lsquo; new &rsquo; Cheltenham was developed &lsquo; largely on the foundation of wealth acquired in the East &rsquo; ( Hart , 1981 : 187 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #46:1>
Money from East India Company operations in Bengal and elsewhere was invested in impressive residential property , urban development , and educational facilities in the town , which became an important &lsquo; basing point &rsquo; for colonially derived capital as well as for the community of officials serving in different parts of the world .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #47:1>
The development was to produce a lasting political flavour ( as Cowan ( 1987 ) points out , it was here that Mrs Thatcher delivered her Falklands War victory speech ) 3 and equally important , a spatially and architecturally impressive environ<l>ment ( the town centre marked by &lsquo; Imperial Square &rsquo; ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #48:1>
In the current phase of global restructuring , the economic , social , and , not least , environmental and architectural attributes of the town have been critical in determining Cheltenham 's new role in the national and international economy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #49:1>
Benefitting from metropolitan decentral<l>ization , Cheltenham is now host to new producer-service industries , particularly in insurance , higher education ( the Universities Central Council for Admissions , the Polytechnic Central Admissions Service , and defence ( GCHQ ) ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #50:1>
It also contains the UK administrative head<l>quarters for Gulf Oil .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #51:1>
In addition to new investment in property , &pound-sign;9 million has been invested in conserving the early nineteenth-century Regency environment ( Cowan , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #52:1>
The urban level
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #53:1>
This level of analysis concentrates on the economic , social , physical , and spatial development over time of the individual metropolitan city within the colonial system as modified by that system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #54:1>
Here , the example may either be a regional city or the metropolitan capital .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #55:1>
If the latter , the analysis will also incorporate phenomena listed at the international level ( p. 60 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #56:1>
In either case , we can hypothesize a city or town whose class structure ( Foster , 1977 ) is related to its par<l>ticular role in the old international division of labour , and particularly , the dependence of its working class on colonial markets ( Massey , 1986 a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #57:1>
Whichever way the social structure is related to the spatial structure ( Dennis , 1984 ) , from a viewpoint of the present day , one significant factor is that there were relatively few if any members of the peripheral , colonial population in the city ( though ethnic diversity in the Jewish population existed in manufacturing centres such as Manchester or Leeds ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #58:1>
This is in contrast to the city in the colonized society ( which received the products from the metropolitan ) where there was a substantial , and largely bourgeois White &lsquo; ethnic minority &rsquo; from the metropolitan society and an indigenous &lsquo; subproletariat &rsquo; &lsquo; below &rsquo; the working class in the metropolitan society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #59:1>
In other words , the international spatial division of labour located the underclass of the industrial city in the colonial society .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #60:1>
In the new international division of labour , analysis at this urban level focuses on the economic , social , and spatial restructuring of the individual city or town but takes into account its earlier history within a colonial mode of production .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #61:1>
Here , a variety of phenomena need to be considered , some of which have recently been investigated ( Cooke , 1986ab &semi; 1989 ) : the most obvious are international labour migration , especially from previously colonial territories ( in the late 1980s , for example , 10 per cent of the population of Blackburn ( in the traditional Lancashire textile region ) is of South Asian origin , as is 25 per cent of the population of Leicester , previously an industrial/knitted-ware centre ) &semi; new industrial structures include branch-plant manufacturing , decentralized white-collar employment , and office development , tourism , etc .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #62:1>
The urban-sector level
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #63:1>
Analysis at this level draws attention to particular sectors in the city as affected by colonial or global capitalist processes :
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #64:1>
such sectors might be economic , social , or spatial .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #65:1>
In the original formulation ( King , 1976 : 32 ) , mention was made of those parts of the metropolitan capital , as well as parts in other cities , developed as a result of colonial connec<l>tions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #66:1>
For example , in the early-nineteenth century , 80 per cent of the principal directors of the East India Company lived within three-quarters of a square mile of Central London ( Marylebone , Baker St , Harley St ) &semi; the large estates in South London ( now public parks ) of Sir John Tate ( sugar interests ) , Edward Horniman ( tea ) , and Sir John Anderson ( P and O shipping lines ) were all within the radius of a few miles &semi; South Kensington was known to colonial ex-patriates as &lsquo; Asia Minor &rsquo; on account of the large number of colonial-returned living there .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #67:1>
St John 's Wood was another favoured area ( King , 1976 : 32 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #68:1>
Likewise , attention might be drawn to particular sectors of the urban economy with strong colonial links such as shipping , banking , insurance , real-estate services , or to the social and cultural influences of colonialism in the formation of elites , the production of science and culture ( in museums ) , or the constitution of research and education .
<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #X69:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-020 #X74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #1:1>
The operation of an activated sludge plant involves the recycling of settled activated sludge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #2:1>
Consequently , microorganisms which are capable of rapid settlement in the sedimentation tank will be recirculated back to the aerator , allowing further division .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #3:1>
The organisms which do not settle will therefore either be devoured by grazing protozoa , or discharged with the effluent into a watercourse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #4:1>
This means that there is an inherent selective pressure for flocculating bacteria &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #5:1>
free-swimming bacteria must demonstrate extremely high growth rates in order to remain an established population .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #6:1>
The intense competition prevailing in the activated sludge process is illustrated by the fact that the majority of the floc flora do not arise from the mammalian enteric tract , despite the continuous high input of bacteria from this source .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #7:1>
Trickling filters
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #8:1>
Trickling filter ecology is concerned largely with the composition of the slime layer or biofilm , which adheres to the surface of the medium .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #9:1>
It is the species composition of this layer which determines the treatment efficiency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #10:1>
The composition of the biofilm is characterised by a vertical stratification of microbial species , resulting from changes in sewage composition as it passes down the filter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #11:1>
Settled sewage , with a high organic strength and nutrient concentration , is deposited at the top of the filter as a falling film , and this results in a high oxygen concentration due to absorption from the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #12:1>
In addition the upper layer of filter media is exposed to light and thus providing conditions which are ideal for algal growth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #13:1>
In the summer months algae may form an extensive green covering on the surface of the filter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #14:1>
Frequently this covering may comprise large filamentous algae such as Phormidium or Stigeoclonium , and under these conditions the distribution of flow may be impaired and the ventilation decreased .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #15:1>
The process of film formation and colonisation is thought to be initiated by slime-producing and capsulated bacteria which adhere to media surfaces conditioned with an organic film .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #16:1>
Attachment prob<l>ably occurs initially by chemical bonding and van der Waals ' forces .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #17:1>
It is a very rapid process and Z. ramigera is frequently observed as the initial coloniser .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #18:1>
Colonisation by other heterotrophic bacteria is also rapid , with Pseudomonas , Flavobacterium and Alcaligenes among the first to appear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #19:1>
After 5 days biofilm will comprise a diverse assemblage of bacteria , of which filamentous types frequently predominate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #20:1>
Over a period of weeks , the slower growing fungi such as Fusarium , Geotrichum and Sporotrichum will appear and contribute to BOD removal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #21:1>
In addition algae such as Chlorella , Euglena , Oscillatoria , Ulothrix and Stigeoclonium will be abundant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #22:1>
Their primary role is likely to be in the removal of nutrients ( nitrogen and phosphorus ) , although in the absence of light it is possible that they may behave heterotrophically and play a small part in BOD removal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #23:1>
Thus a mature biofilm comprises an outer layer which is largely fungi , a middle layer of fungi and algae and an inner layer of bacteria , fungi and algae , and in contrast to the activated sludge process , fungi and algae are the major component of the biomass .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #24:1>
During its passage down the filter , organic material in the wastewater together with oxygen and nutrients , will diffuse into the biofilm and be oxidised by the heterotrophic microorganisms.
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #25:1>
The amount of organic material and oxygen available for microbial growth will thus depend on the film thickness and the organic load applied to the filter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #26:1>
A point will be reached where the thickness of the film prevents sufficient nutrients reaching the layer of microorgan<l>isms which is attached to the medium .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #27:1>
Consequently this layer will undergo starvation and ultimately death , causing the entire biofilm to detach from its support ( Figure 4.12 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #28:1>
This process is known as &lsquo; sloughing-off &rsquo; and the detached film , referred to as humus sludge , is collected in a humus tank .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #29:1>
In addition to horizontal gradients of nutrient depletion across a biofilm , there will also be a steep vertical gradient as BOD is progressively removed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #30:1>
In addition there will be an increase in wastewater alkalinity resulting from dissolved CO 2 and a high oxygen concentration as the oxygen introduced by the draught tubes is not removed by oxidation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #31:1>
Consequently , providing that the filter is not subjected to a high loading , the lower reaches often harbour a large population of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #32:1>
The steep vertical gradient of BOD also influences the distribution of protozoa within a filter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #33:1>
Protozoa are plentiful in filters and over 200 species have been identified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #34:1>
Numerically the ciliates are the most abundant type with from 500 to 10000 ml -1 mixed liquor routinely observed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #35:1>
This compares with 100 to 4600 ml -1 for the amoebae and 200-13000 ml -1 for the flagellates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #36:1>
Such information , however , provides little information as to the relative proportions of total biomass , since they are considerably larger than the other component microorganisms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #37:1>
The surface of trickling filters shows a restricted protozoal fauna , comprising mainly the holozoic amoebae and flagellates , whereas a greater variety are found in the lower regions and these are predominantly carnivorous .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #38:1>
Waste stabilisation ponds
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #39:1>
The microbial ecology of a waste stabilisation pond is extremely complicated as it closely approximates that of a natural ecosystem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #40:1>
Consequently it has a wide species diversity and incorporates a number of complete nutrient cycles ( namely carbon , nitrogen and sulphur ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #41:1>
Ponds are unique among biological treatment processes in that , with the exception of anaerobic ponds , primary producers predominate &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #42:1>
thus there is an increase in energy through the system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #43:1>
As the functions of anaerobic , facultative and maturation ponds are quite different , then the microbial communities which inhabit these ponds , will also be quite different .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #44:1>
1 . Anaerobic ponds
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #45:1>
Wastewater entering anaerobic ponds is initially metabolised by a group of facultatively anaerobic heterotrophs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #46:1>
These organisms enzymically hydrolyse polymeric material , such as protein , fats and carbohydrate , into their constituent monomers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #47:1>
The high loading rates applied to anaerobic ponds ensures that oxygen is utilised more rapidly than it is replaced by atmospheric diffusion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #48:1>
Consequently , these monomers may be metabolised in the absence of oxygen resulting in the production of volatile fatty acids and in particular acetate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #49:1>
For this reason the bacteria which catalyse this fermentation , are generally referred to as the acid formers , and typical genera include Clostridium , Propionibacterium and Bacteroides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #50:1>
The meth<l>anogenic bacteria ( Methanobacteriaceae ) are strictly anaerobic and killed rapidly by relatively short exposure times to oxygen .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #51:1>
They obtain their energy for growth via the formation of methane from the reduction of CO 2 and the oxidation of only a limited range of compounds , namely hydrogen , formate , acetate and methanol .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #52:1>
Successful operation of an anaerobic pond is dependent upon the establishment of an active population of methanogenic bacteria .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #53:1>
These bacteria are extremely fastidious and susceptible to changes in temperature and pH .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #54:1>
If the loading rate is too high , volatile acid production exceeds the rate at which they are degraded by the mehanogens methanogens , consequently the pH falls and the methanogen popul<l>ation is killed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #55:1>
In the absence of the methanogens , digestion and stabilisation of a waste is prevented and volatile fatty acids will accumulate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #56:1>
These compounds , in particular butyric acid , are respon<l>sible for noxious odours , and the waste is putrefied rather than stabilised .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #57:1>
Another important group of organisms present in anaerobic ponds are the sulphate-reducing bacteria .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #58:1>
These are an extensive and varied group of microorganisms which can respire anaerobically , reducing sulphate to sulphide ( e.g. Desulfotomaculum ) or can reduce elemental sulphur to sulphide ( Desulfuromonas ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #59:1>
The range of substrates which they are capable of oxidising is also quite varied , whereas some of them exploit acetate and hydrogen , others grow on higher chain fatty acids and excrete acetate as an end-product .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #60:1>
Sulphate reducers are generally beneficial in that they are responsible for the removal of wastes which have a high sulphate concentration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #61:1>
However , produc<l>tion of hydrogen sulphide gas may result in odours if the sulphate content of the influent is excessive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #62:1>
2 . Facultative ponds
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #63:1>
The mechanism for the bacterial removal of BOD and ammonia in facultative ponds is identical to that in the activated sludge process and trickling filters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #64:1>
The essential feature of facultative ponds , however , is that the oxygen necessary to satisfy the BOD demand of the waste is produced by algae as a result of photosynthesis , and utilised by the heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria for the oxidation of carbon and nitrogen .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #65:1>
The dominant bacterial genera include Pseudomonas , Flavobacterium and Achromobacter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #66:1>
In return the algae exploit the CO 2 and NH 3 produced from these reactions as a source of cell carbon and nitrogen ( Figure 4.13 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #67:1>
Although fungi are routinely observed in ponds in small numbers , little is known of their role and ecology .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #68:1>
It is also suspected that many of the fungal species isolated derive mainly from the surrounding soil and plants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #69:1>
The ecology of protozoa in ponds reveals similar gaps in our knowledge &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #70:1>
although these organisms are present , little is known concerning the types of species or their numbers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #71:1>
It is possible that protozoa may play a significant role in the removal of both viral and bacterial pathogens , although there is no evidence for this at the present time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #72:1>
As with natural ecosystems , ponds demonstrate a decrease in species diversity with increasing saprobity or organic strength .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #73:1>
Thus it is not uncommon to find facultative ponds which contain only a few species of algae with one species dominant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #74:1>
The dominant species is generally a motile algae which is better able to exploit the available surface light by forming dense bands &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #75:1>
these are capable of moving up and down the water column to reside at the depth of optimal light intensity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #76:1>
Consequently , flagellated organisms such as Chlamy<l>domonas or Chlorella tend to predominate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #77:1>
Algal bands with counts of Chlorella as high as 5000 ml -1 have been recorded .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #78:1>
Vertical speci<l>ation in facultative ponds is marked , as there will be a decreasing gradient of light intensity , pH , dissolved oxygen concentration and organic strength .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #79:1>
Consequently the upper and middle layers will witness the maximum activity in terms of BOD and nutrient removal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #80:1>
The lower layer of a facultative pond will have a similar ecosystem to that of an anaerobic pond .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #81:1>
In addition , however , it is important in the slow anaerobic degradation of large recalcitrant molecules and dead algal cells , with consequent nutrient recycling .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #82:1>
This process results in the production of hydrogen sulphide from the reduction of sulphur ( which is present in proteins ) and sulphate ( which escaped reduction in the anaerobic pond ) , by the sulphate-reducing bacteria .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #83:1>
This sulphide is then oxidised to elemental sulphur or thiosulphate by aerobic sulphide oxidisers such as Beggiatoa which are present in the aerobic layer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #84:1>
3 . Maturation ponds
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #85:1>
Maturation ponds have a very low organic content and consequently a higher species diversity , resulting in the presence of many more algal types .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #86:1>
In addition the increased clarity of the water results in a greater light penetration , which allows non-motile algae such as Scenedesmus and Chlorella to compete successfully with the flagellates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #87:1>
The main algal genera found in these ponds are listed in Table 4.4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #88:1>
The reduced organic strength of maturation ponds causes a reduction in the total heterotrophic population , although the species diversity increases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #89:1>
Little information is available on the composition of the microbial population , but it might be expected that an increased number of nitrifying bacteria will be present .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #90:1>
Despite the high prevalent dissolved oxygen , bacteria play little or no part in the role of maturation ponds , which are primarily for pathogen destruction , nutrient removal and suspended solids removal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #91:1>
Nutrition removal is achieved mainly by the algae which take up large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #92:1>
In addition they aid in pathogen removal by providing an elevated pH as a result of CO 2 stripping .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #93:1>
The major mechanisms for the removal of pathogens are as yet unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #94:1>
Nutrient starvation which results from the inability of gut microflora to compete successfully for organic substrates present at low con<l>centrations , is likely to prove important .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #95:1>
This process is aided by the long retention times in maturation ponds , and will be exacerbated at elevated temperatures due to a higher energy demand necessary to satisfy an increased endogenous respiration rate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-021 #96:1>
Other factors such as ultraviolet ( UV ) light , oxygen toxicity and the production of algal toxins are also likely to play minor roles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #1:1>
5.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #2:1>
Sandy shores
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #3:1>
The last section was concerned with coasts where wave energy is low , and the beach deposits tend to be fine silts and clays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #4:1>
On exposed shores , mudflats are replaced by sandflats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #5:1>
In temperate zones , areas of sand dunes usually lie to the landward of extensive sand beaches .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #6:1>
These dunes are derived from the sand at high levels on the beach , which dries out at some stages of the tide , and may then be moved inland by the action of the wind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #7:1>
The majority of tropical shores , in contrast , are not backed by dune systems ( Pethick , 1984 ) , but are colonized by fast-growing vegetation ( Jennings , 1965 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #8:1>
This may be because the sand is more often kept damp by rain , and hence is in general more stable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #9:1>
In spite of the predominant juxtaposition of sandflats and sand dunes on temperate shores , the two environments have seldom been considered together .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #10:1>
The sandflats are regarded as the province of marine biologists , while the dunes are investigated by terrestrial biologists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #11:1>
This unfortunately means that the junction of the two is often neglected .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #12:1>
To some extent it must be admitted that this also reflects the relatively sudden change in conditions between flat and dune .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #13:1>
Here we can best discuss the interface by first describing conditions within the intertidal sands , and then contrasting these conditions with those of the dunes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #14:1>
Following this , we will examine the transition to truly terrestrial soils .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #15:1>
5.2.1 The physical environment of marine sandflats
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #16:1>
Because the distribution of particle sizes on sedimentary shores relates directly to water velocity , coarse sand beaches are found where either wave action or longshore currents are high .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #17:1>
The water movements associated both with waves ( which act normal to the shore ) and with currents ( parallel with the shore ) are involved in sorting the sediment particles , so that fine particles are transported to areas of low current velocity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #18:1>
At the same time , sorting may produce considerable variation in particle size on any one beach .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #19:1>
In particular , finer particles are often found low on the shore , and coarser ones at the top , and these differences are often also associated with an increase in slope from low shore to the top of the intertidal zone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #20:1>
The reasons for this distribution are far from understood , but may be related to the fact that the velocity of waves breaking on the shore tends to be greater than the velocity of water draining back down the beach after the waves have broken .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #21:1>
This asymmetry in velocity may tend to leave larger particles higher up the shore ( taken there by high incoming velocity ) , whereas smaller particles come to equilibrium further down the beach , moved by the lower outgoing velocity ( see Pethick , 1984 , for discussion ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #22:1>
However the sorting occurs , its presence is an important factor in affecting the environment within the sand , because sands of different particle-size composition , and with various degrees of sorting , show a wide range of physical properties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #23:1>
In general , the better sorted sands have more space between the particles ( a higher &lsquo; porosity &rsquo; ) than do badly sorted sands .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #24:1>
This is because the small particles in a badly sorted sand can partly fill up the gaps between the larger particles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #25:1>
The degree to which the gaps are filled up depends also on several other factors , including the shape of the particles , and how well the particles are packed together .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #26:1>
If the sand is deposited rapidly , grains tend to be badly packed , leaving a large pore space , but when deposition rates are slow , there is time for each grain to gravitate to its equilibrium position , providing good packing and low porosity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #27:1>
Although the porosity of sediments is important in defining the living space available for the fauna , a more important characteristic is probably the permeability - the rate at which water can flow through the sediment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #28:1>
The rate of flow determines , for example , the degree to which the sand will dry out at low water , the extent to which interstitial water may be replaced by overlying water of different quality ( e.g. different in salinity or temperature ) , and the extent to which oxygen in the interstitial water , once used up , is replaced by incoming oxygenated water .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #29:1>
Permeability is determined not by the overall interstitial space , or porosity , but by the size of the individual pores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #30:1>
Well-sorted sediments with large particles will have large pores , and hence a high permeability , while sediments with small particles , or a mixture of large and small particles , will have small pores and hence a low permeability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #31:1>
This is well illustrated by an example of sands from a Nigerian estuary ( Webb , 1957 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #32:1>
With sand of an average grain diameter of 0.25 mm , 50 cm height of water drained through a 10 cm depth of sand in 10 min 36 sec .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #33:1>
With an average grain diameter of 0.15 mm , the equivalent drainage time was 25 h 30 min .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #34:1>
The degree to which water can circulate within a sediment is further affected by the percentage of the water that is held in place between the particles by surface forces .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #35:1>
In coarse-grained sediments , such as Nigerian sand of an average grain diameter 0.9 mm , this may be negligible , but in finer sands a significant proportion of the water is held by capillarity :
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #36:1>
for sediments with an average grain size of 0.15 mm , about 14% of the water was not free for circulation ( Webb , 1957 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #37:1>
Capillary forces are therefore an important factor in determining the extent to which sands remain damp when emersed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #38:1>
Again , an example from Nigerian sand is instructive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #39:1>
When sand of average grain size 0.9 mm was placed above a water supply , water rose to a height of 4.7 cm in the sand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #40:1>
With sand of average grain size 0.15 mm , the water rose by capillarity 33.5 cm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #41:1>
We can crudely summarize the effects of porosity and permeability by saying that fine sands retain a high water content but allow water to penetrate through the sediment only slowly , while coarse sands allow water to enter and to leave rapidly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #42:1>
Sands with mixtures of particle sizes have both reduced porosity and reduced permeability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #43:1>
The overall result of these effects is that the water table is frequently near the surface on the lower shore , but only rises to the surface high on the shore at times of high tide .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #44:1>
At other times the water drains away in the coarse , permeable sands , and it may be 1 m below the surface for most of the time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #45:1>
Water available high on the shore is mainly capillary-held water , but even this may be scarce because there is very little restriction on water flow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #46:1>
The major consequence of any reduction in water flow through the sediment is a lowering of oxygen concentration , because oxygen is used up by organisms faster than it can be replaced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #47:1>
This can be demonstrated by examining the depth profiles of oxygen availability in a variety of sands at different seasons , as has been done by McLachlan ( 1978 ) in the Isle of Man .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #48:1>
Here the oxygen availability decreased with depth down to 20 cm below the surface ( Fig. 5.1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #49:1>
Although this decrease does not appear striking , the change in chemical regime is overwhelming , so that whereas oxidizing processes were dominant at the surface , reducing processes were dominant 20 cm down .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #50:1>
This change is readily measured by recording Eh , the redox potential , which reflects the balance between oxidizing and reducing processes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #51:1>
The break in the redox potential profile , known as the redox potential discontinuity ( RPD ) occurred at shallower depths in finer sediments .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #52:1>
The RPD was also nearer to the surface in summer than in winter , presumably because of the faster rate of consumption of oxygen by organisms at higher temperatures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #53:1>
The distribution of interstitial meiofa<l>una changed as the position of the RPD changed :
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #54:1>
in finer sediments , in winter , nematodes were much commoner near the surface , whereas in only slightly coarser sediments they were common down to 20 cm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #55:1>
In summer , the bulk of all populations was restricted to the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #56:1>
The physical characteristics of intertidal sediments , then , are responsible for the chemical conditions within the interstitial water , and these in turn control the distribution of the small animals .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #57:1>
As will be seen later , the larger animals are to a great extent independent of these conditions because they form burrows which have their own micro-climate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #58:1>
5.2.2 The physical environment of coastal sand dunes
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #59:1>
First it is necessary to give a brief outline of how coastal sand dunes form and evolve .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #60:1>
Detailed accounts have been provided by Ranwell ( 1972 ) and Pethick ( 1984 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #61:1>
Towards the top of sandy shores , onshore winds tend to move dry sand grains inland .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #62:1>
This is not a uniform procedure , however , because the moving sand grains encounter the collection of litter and debris left by succeeding high tides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #63:1>
Around these obstacles , wind velocity varies greatly , and sand is deposited mainly on their lee side , eventually forming a small hump .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #64:1>
Such formations may not be permanent , but , if colonized by stabilizing grasses such as Agropyron , they may enlarge to form embryo dunes , up to 1 or 2 m high .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #65:1>
Agropyron helps both to trap more sand , and to hold it in position .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #66:1>
Colonization by further species of stabilizing grasses such as marram grass , Ammophila spp. , may lead to further accretion of sand , and the evolution of fore dunes , which may be up to about 10 m high .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #67:1>
The ridge of fore dunes is not stationary , but moves inland as it grows , to be replaced by more dunes on the seaward side if the sand supply is adequate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #68:1>
Dunes found further inland are therefore older , and , because they contain more organic matter added by the first colonizing plants , they provide more nutrient-rich environments which lead in turn to colonization by yet further species .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #69:1>
Wind velocities inland are also lower than those at the seaward edge of the dunes , so that the inland dunes - often known as fixed dunes - are less mobile .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #70:1>
In some regions , however , their vegetation may be eroded to form barren areas called &lsquo; blow-outs &rsquo; , and here the sand may be removed down to the water table to form areas called dune slacks : low-lying , damp regions with a specialized fauna and flora .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #71:1>
Conditions within the sands of the embryo dunes are similar to those at the top of the intertidal zone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #72:1>
Water supplies are minimal , and depend essentially upon rain , and the water table is far below the surface :
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #73:1>
at the surface , water contents on dunes colonized by Ammophila may be as low as 5% by volume , and the water table may be many metres below .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #74:1>
Rain water is held in the sand , well above the water table , by capillarity , and is possibly added to by water condensing as dew .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #75:1>
ln the fixed dunes , with their much higher organic content , and therefore with a greater proportion of fine particles , water contents may be much higher - up to about 30% by volume - and in the dune slacks the soils may reach saturation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #76:1>
Further changes occur in the soils of fixed dunes and slacks , but again these are mainly due to the accumulation of organic matter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #77:1>
The pH tends to decline because rainfall washes the carbonates out of the system , and , although nutrients accumulate as organic matter accumulates , some are washed from the dunes into the slacks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #78:1>
Details of these changes in one set of dunes over a period of several hundred years have been discussed by Wilson ( 1960 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #79:1>
It is thus the slacks that have soils most resembling those of true terrestrial situations , and the richest plant and animal communities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #80:1>
5.2.3 The relationships of dune sands to terrestrial soils
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #81:1>
For marine animal lines that might move on to land through sandy shores and sand dunes , it is important to consider the final step in the transition , between dune soils and inland terrestrial soils .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #82:1>
The variety of terrestrial soils is immense ( see , e.g. FitzPatrick , 1980 ) , but it is possible to make some generalizations about the differences between most terrestrial soils and coastal dune sands .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #83:1>
The major difference lies in the very small amount of clay particles in dune sands .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #84:1>
These inorganic clay particles have a diameter of less than about 2 &mu;m , so that in sand dunes they tend to be leached downwards with the rainwater which also washes out carbonates from the system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #85:1>
Leaching is a continuous process in the dunes because the sands do not overlie a bedrock which is being gradually weathered , as do most terrestrial soils , but if anything are accreting more depth of sand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #86:1>
Even in fixed dunes , which are covered by vegetation , the soils consist mainly of sand ( quartz ) particles mixed with organic humus derived from plants , but without fine clay particles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #87:1>
Many terrestrial soils , in contrast , contain large proportions of very small particles made up of clay minerals .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #88:1>
These clay particles aggregate together , and also coat the larger particles , so that the soil structure consists of particle aggregates rather than assemblages of individual un-connected sand particles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #89:1>
This in turn means that terrestrial soils have a great variety of effective particle sizes , and also have a better capacity for water retention than sands : water is retained not just between the particles , but within the particle aggregates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #90:1>
When the soil dries out , water evaporates first from the external surfaces of the aggregates , and only then does it move out from the insides of the aggregates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #91:1>
The states of water in soils , and the factors affecting its evaporation , are clearly summarized by Vannier ( 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #92:1>
Overall , the water contents of terrestrial soils are not only higher but more constant than those of sand dunes , providing a more favourable environment for animal life .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #93:1>
The diversity of animal life in terrestrial soils in turn enriches the soil by comminuting it , aerating it , and incorporating further organic matter into it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #94:1>
In summary , terrestrial soils have a more complex structure than dune soils , providing an environment which is often more stable and more favourable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #95:1>
The critical phase for animal lines invading the land via sand ecosystems would therefore have been the initial movement into the sand dunes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #96:1>
Lines that penetrated these would have had few problems in taking the next movement into terrestrial soils .
<ICE-GB:W2A-022 #97:1>
The rest of this chapter is therefore concerned with the possible movement of ancestral marine lines from intertidal sands to sands beyond the direct influence of the sea .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #1:1>
2.8.1 Modern isolated platforms
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #2:1>
The Bahama Banks form a very large isolated platform ( area of 96000 km 2 ) , cut off from the Florida Shelf by the deep Florida Straits .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #3:1>
The facies around the margin of the Bahama Platform are very much dependent on whether the margin is leeward or windward , open or protected , or tide-dominated ( see Sections 3.2 , 4.2 and 5.11 &semi; Hine et al. , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #4:1>
Reefs are particularly well developed along windward margins , and the type of sand body varies consider<l>ably in geometry , structure and grain type depend<l>ing on location .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #5:1>
The central parts of the Bahama Platform are occupied by shallow subtidal quiet-water skeletal muds and sandy muds , and tidal flats with peloidal muds , algal mats and mangroves ( etc. ) occur around islands ( Section 3.2.1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #6:1>
Because the Bahama Platform is very large , the facies developments there can be used in the facies models for the rimmed shelf and epeiric platform , described in previous sections .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #7:1>
Much smaller isolated platforms include those on the Coral Sea Plateau ( Orme , 1977 : Read , 1985 ) , and some of the reefs off the Belize Shelf .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #8:1>
In addition , shallow-water carbonates are being deposited upon fault-blocks in the Red Sea ( Fig. 2.24 &semi; Purser et al. , 1987 ) , and in the Arabian Gulf they are accumulating upon topographic highs caused by salt diapirism ( Section 3.4.1 &semi; Purser , I973b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #9:1>
Glovers Reef is an oval-shaped isolated platform , 28 X 10 km , situated 15 km east of the major barrier reef rimming the Belize Shelf ( James &ampersand; Ginsburg , 1979 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #10:1>
Glovers atoll appears to be a fault-block upon a rifted continental margin , trailing edge ( Fig. 2.8 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #11:1>
This isolated platform has a nearly continuous mar<l>ginal reef , but it is narrower on the western , leeward side , and Acropora palmata , the robust frame<l>building coral of many Caribbean reefs , is less common there .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #12:1>
The reef rim provides protection for a central lagoon , 6-18 m deep , where patch reefs are numerous .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #13:1>
Poorly-sorted coarse sands occur around the patch reefs and muddy fine sands cover the lagoon floor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #14:1>
Off the Trucial Coast of the Arabian Gulf , topog<l>raphic highs with coralgal reefs rise above the deep , muddy ramp , and are a few square kilometres in area .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #15:1>
In fact , there is quite a variation in the carbonate facies upon these highs , so that a range of facies models can be produced to illustrate the progressive development of carbonate sedimentation ( Purser , 1973b &semi; reviewed in Tucker , 1985a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #16:1>
Four stages are recognized .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #17:1>
The initial stage is the development of carbonate sands on the high through enhanced carbo<l>nate skeletal production on this shallow agitated area and winnowing out of lime mud .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #18:1>
Sand distribution is asymmetric , sedimentation taking place mainly in a downwind direction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #19:1>
Stage 2 is the establishment of a reef on the windward side of the high , giving rise to more rapid production and accumulation of skeletal sand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #20:1>
In stage 3 , reef growth is well advanced , producing more of a barrier to waves and currents , so that downwind tails of reef debris from the margins of the reef produce a leeside lagoon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #21:1>
Island formation is likely from storm piling-up of reef talus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #22:1>
In stage 4 , the reef has grown most or all the way around the topographic high to enclose a lagoon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #23:1>
Lime muds may accumulate here in this atoll-like stage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #24:1>
In the Gulf of Suez , carbonates are being deposited upon tilted fault-blocks formed during rifting , and the facies pattern here is one of reefs developed along the gulf-ward side of the block , with lagoonal sediments behind ( Fig. 2.24 &semi; Purser et al. , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #25:1>
Where several blocks occur , those nearer to the rift margin are subject to periodic influxes of clastic sedi<l>ment and freshwater from alluvial fans , and this can kill off some of the nearshore reefs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #26:1>
2.8.2 Ancient isolated platforms
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #27:1>
Isolated carbonate platforms occur in the Devonian of western Canada , where reef development is more extensive on the windward side .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #28:1>
The subsurface Golden Spike Reef complex of the Frasnian Leduc Formation is a good example ( Walls , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #29:1>
The reefs are mainly massive stromatoporoid framestones to bindstones , and stromatoporoid rudstones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #30:1>
A reef talus surrounds the isolated platform and passes rapidly into basinal shale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #31:1>
The platform interior facies consist of interbedded skeletal , sand flat grainstones and packstones and peritidal planar stromatolites .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #32:1>
Small patch reefs of massive and branching stromato<l>poroids also occur .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #33:1>
The Golden Spike Reef is a prolific oil producer , with the highest porosities occurring in the marginal reef facies and the skeletal sands .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #34:1>
Mesozoic isolated platforms are well represented in the Tethyan region .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #35:1>
They occur in the Triassic of the Dolomites and Jurassic of the Venetian Alps in northern Italy ( Bosellini et al. , 1981 &semi; Bosellini , 1984 &semi; Blendinger , 1986 ) , and in the Cretaceous of the Apennines of central Italy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #36:1>
The Golden Lane &lsquo; atoll &rsquo; of mid-Cretaceous age in Mexico ( Enos , 1977b , 1988 ) is another good example .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #37:1>
2.9 DROWNED CARBONATE PLATFORMS
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #38:1>
Rapid relative sea-level rises are required to drown a carbonate platform , since , as explained in Section 2.2.1 , shallow-water carbonate production rates are generally more than sufficient to keep pace with moderate rates of subsidence and sea-level rise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #39:1>
Rapid relative sea-level rises can be brought about by fault-induced subsidence and glacio-eustatic sea-level rises .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #40:1>
One other possibility for drowning is a drastic re<l>duction in carbonate productivity as a result of some environmental stress , so that shallow-water carbonate deposition is unable to keep up with even moderate relative sea-level rises .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #41:1>
The development of poorly-oxygenated and/or low nutrient waters on a platform or climatic changes could have this effect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #42:1>
Drowned platforms typically have deep-water carbonate facies overlying the shallow-water facies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #43:1>
Where the sea-level rise was sufficient to take the platform below the photic zone , then many benthic organisms , but especially algae , will be excluded , and the carbonates will be dominated by planktonic-nektonic fossils ( such as coccoliths , planktonic for<l>aminifera , pteropods , certain thin-shelled bivalves and ammonoids ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #44:1>
These pelagic carbonates are usually fine-grained , nodular to thin-bedded limestones , with shaley partings or a clay-poor and clay-rich bedding ( see Chapter 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #45:1>
Hardgrounds may occur , and strati<l>graphic thickness is generally reduced relative to contemporaneous shallow-water facies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #46:1>
Mineralized surfaces may be present , with Fe and Mn oxides and phosphate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #47:1>
Disconformities and stratigraphic breaks can also occur in drowned platform sequences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #48:1>
During drowning of a platform , reefs with their higher production rate than surrounding areas may be able to keep up with the rapid sea-level rise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #49:1>
This can generate a high-relief barrier or a pinnacle mor<l>phology if starting from a patch reef .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #50:1>
The latter commonly develop on drowned ramps .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #51:1>
Backstep<l>ping of a rimmed shelf may take place when sea-level rise is rapid and reef growth resumes to landward during an ensuing still-stand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #52:1>
Drowning of a rimmed shelf can lead to the formation of a distally-steepened ramp .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #53:1>
When the sea-level rise is not sufficient to termin<l>ate most benthic carbonate production , then an in<l>cipiently drowned platform is produced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #54:1>
Depths will still be within the photic zone in these instances and if there are no further sea-level rises , the platform may aggrade into very shallow water again .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #55:1>
Modern drowned platforms are common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans , where atolls and isolated platforms have sunk below the photic zone , largely as a result of thermal subsidence following a cessation of volcanicity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #56:1>
In the Caribbean , Cay Sal Bank ( shown in Fig. 3.2 ) is a small drowned platform , and the Blake Plateau north of the Bahamas is a much larger one .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #57:1>
The latter was a shallow-water platform in the Cretaceous which subsequently underwent rapid subsidence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #58:1>
is now at 2000-4000 m depth receiv<l>ing pelagic sediments and Fe and Mn oxide precipi<l>tates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #59:1>
Modern distally-steepened ramps such as eastern Yucatan and west Florida are the result of the rapid Holocene post-glacial sea-level rise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #60:1>
The Holocene Queensland Shelf has been termed an incipiently-drowned rimmed shelf , where the shelf-edge reefs were able to keep growing and so form the Great Barrier Reef , with a deep and broad lagoon behind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #61:1>
There are numerous ancient examples of drowned platforms ( see Kendall &ampersand; Schlager , 1981 &semi; Schlager , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #62:1>
They are particularly well developed in the Jurassic of the Tethyan area and in the Devonian of western Europe &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #63:1>
in both instances , shallow-water carbonates are overlain by ammonoid-bearing pelagic limestones ( see Chapter 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #64:1>
Drowned platforms also occur widely in the Cretaceous , as in Texas , Mexico and the Middle East .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #65:1>
Ancient incipiently-drowned platforms also occur in the Devonian , in western Canada and the Canning Basin for example .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #66:1>
In the latter case , rapid sea-level rise caused backstepping of reefs at the rimmed shelf margin ( see Fig. 4.98 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #67:1>
Pinnacle reefs formed by continuous sea-level rise are common on the slope into the Silurian Michigan Basin ( see Fig. 2.22 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #68:1>
2.10 CARBONATE CYCLES
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #69:1>
Through normal depositional processes , such as pro<l>gradation of tidal flats , lateral migration of tidal islands , of carbonate sand bodies , and vertical accretion of shallow subtidal sediments into shallower depths , carbonate platforms will build up to sea-level and just above .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #70:1>
The typical sequence produced is a shallowing-upward unit of subtidal through to intertidal-supratidal deposits .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #71:1>
Such a se<l>quence is revealed by coring through Holocene sedi<l>ments on the western side of Andros Island ( see Fig. 3.22 , Section 3.2.2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #72:1>
In view of the deposition close to sea-level , a relative drop in sea-level will expose the platform to supratidal-subaerial processes , such as sabkha evaporite precipitation if the climate is arid and there is still a source of seawater , soil for<l>mation , like calcretization if a semi-arid climate pre<l>vails , or karstification if more humid .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #73:1>
With a relative rise in sea-level , subtidal environments are widely established over a platform , with tidal flats at the distant shoreline .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #74:1>
2.10.1 Shallowing-upward carbonate cycles
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #75:1>
Repetitions of small-scale shallowing-upward units are common in carbonate formations , demonstrating the periodic flooding of platforms through transgress<l>ive events .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #76:1>
For examples see Laporte ( 1967 ) , Coogan ( 1969 ) , Ginsburg ( 1975 ) , Wilson ( 1975 ) , Lohmann ( 1976 ) , Somerville ( 1979 ) , Bridges ( 1982 ) , Enos ( 1983 ) , Grotzinger ( 1986a,b ) , Hardie ( 1986a,b ) , Hardie et al. ( 1986 ) and Goldhammer et al. ( 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #77:1>
In detail , the cycles are very variable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #78:1>
Microfacies analysis reveals differences within one cycle when traced laterally across a platform , and between cycles in a vertical sequence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #79:1>
Frequently , the cycles of one particular stage or substage of a geological period have features in common , which are different from those in the cycles of a succeeding stage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #80:1>
Such is the case with cycles in the British Dinantian ( Lower Carboniferous ) , reviewed in Walkden ( 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #81:1>
Shallowing-upward cycles are developed in the Asbian , and Brigantian stages of the Upper Dinantian in Wales ( Fig. 2.25 Somerville , 1979 &semi; Gray , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #82:1>
When cycles are traced towards the platform interior , gradual but distinct changes are observed in addition to a general shorewards thinning of each cycle ( Fig. 2.26 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #83:1>
Away from the open platform , the transgressive phase ( a below fairweather wave-base , thin argil<l>laceous packstone-wackestone facies ) , which forms the lower part of each cycle , gradually reduces in thickness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #84:1>
Sequences of more proximal areas tend to have shallow subtidal ( above fairweather wave-base ) sediments in their lower parts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #85:1>
The &lsquo; regressive &rsquo; phase tidal flat sediments ( fenestral , stromatolitic , peloidal wackestones ) increase in thickness as cycles are traced shorewards and may comprise the whole cycle in very proximal areas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #86:1>
Lateral variations are also seen in the nature of emergence horizons at the top of each cycle :
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #87:1>
in proximal areas , paleokarstic surfaces are usually developed ( possibly above a calcrete ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #88:1>
These pass distally into &lsquo; sutured discontinuity sur<l>faces &rsquo; , interpreted as the product of intertidal , rather than wholly subaerial , dissolution and erosion ( cf. Read &ampersand; Grover , 1977 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #89:1>
The lateral variations in these Dinantian cycles are primarily a function of the gradient of the platform .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #90:1>
The transgressions appear to have been relatively rapid , and during the transgression , a basal bed was developed in distal to medial areas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #91:1>
Sedimentation after the initial transgression was determined by depth , especially relative to wave-base ( see Fig. 2.26A ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #92:1>
Differences between cycles of different stages relate to the magnitude of the transgressions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #93:1>
For exam<l>ple , compared with Asbian cycles , those of the Brigantian are dominated by thin-bedded below wave-base packstones-wackestones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #94:1>
This indicates that the transgressions were more extensive , resulting in a greater depth of water over the platform .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #95:1>
Within the Upper Dinantian sequence of mid-Wales , and elsewhere in the UK , it is not uncommon to find cycles &lsquo; missing &rsquo; in proximal areas or unrecog<l>nizable in more distal areas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #96:1>
Problems of stratigraphic correlation can result .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #97:1>
The absence of sediments of a particular cycle in proximal areas results from weak transgressions that did not extend landwards as far as earlier and later ones ( see Fig. 2.26B ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #98:1>
Where this happened , the subaerial processes operated for a longer time ( over several cycles ) and very marked palaeokarstic horizons can develop ( multiple palaeo<l>karsts ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #99:1>
In more distal platform areas , it could happen that the prograding tidal flats did not arrive , so that subtidal conditions were maintained throughout .
<ICE-GB:W2A-023 #100:1>
Fluctuations from below to above wave-base may be recognized by careful study of microfacies ( e.g. Jefferson , 1980 ) , or it may be that sea-level changes were not substantial enough on the open platform to cause any modification to the sedimentary facies .

<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #1:1>
Reduction in the amount of ATP used
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #2:1>
In metabolic terms this means reduction in fluxes that utilize ATP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #3:1>
The term &lsquo; flux &rsquo; , as used here , means the rate of flow of material through a chemical pathway , or the rate of transfer from one site to another , with units amount/time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #4:1>
Since ATP is used up in muscular contraction , a reduction in muscular work , as discussed above , would be one way of reducing total ATP flux .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #5:1>
We must now consider the very large com<l>ponent of energy expenditure that is not involved in physical work , namely the basal or resting metabolic rate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #6:1>
The BMR does , of course , include the cost of some muscular work , such as that needed for respiration and circulation of the blood .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #7:1>
Values for the BMR collected from all over the world show that in tropical countries the rate per kilogram body weight tends to be some ten per cent lower than in Europe or North America ( Schofield et al . , 1985 &semi; Henry &ampersand; Rees , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #8:1>
It is not absolutely clear how far , if at all , this is a climatic effect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #9:1>
Mason , an American missionary , found that her BMR fell every time she moved from Boston to India ( Mason &ampersand; Jacob , 1972 ) , and Sir Charles Martin , who recorded his BMR every day during a 35 day voyage to Australia , found a distinct fall when his ship entered the Indian Ocean and a rise to the original level when she reached the south-easterly Trades ( Martin , 1930 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #10:1>
On the other hand , Eijkman ( 1924 ) stated that his BMR was the same in Batavia ( Dutch East Indies ) as in Holland .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #11:1>
Shetty ( 1984 ) , working in Bangalore , India , found that labourers with a very low BMI ( average 17.6 ) and a low energy intake ( average 1600 kcal per day ) , had BMRs per kg that were about 10 per cent lower than those of well-nourished controls in the same environment and 17 per cent lower than the rates expected from the prediction equations of Schofield et al. ( 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #12:1>
McNeill et al. ( 1987 ) , in studies on peasant farmers in Tamil Nadu ( South India ) , with an average BMI of 19 , also found BMRs lower than the predicted rates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #13:1>
They attributed this to differences in body weight and body composition , rather than to a true reduction in the metabolic rate of the tissues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #14:1>
The difficulty with this explanation is that people with a low BMI would have less body fat &semi; moreover , judging by the experimental evidence , any reduction of lean body mass is likely to be mainly at the expense of slowly metabolizing tissues , particularly muscle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #15:1>
One would therefore expect small lean people to have higher BMRs per kilogram than their heavier and fatter Western counterparts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #16:1>
These studies were on people who had probably been exposed to low energy intakes throughout their lives .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #17:1>
The classical experiment of Keys and coworkers ( 1950 ) on semistarvation in North American volunteers is , however , relevant because it was continued for six months .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #18:1>
James &ampersand; Shetty ( 1982 ) , reanalysing the results of that experiment , concluded that &lsquo; the small ( sic ) fall in BMR per unit active tissue mass ( by 16 per cent ) in the first 2 weeks remains essentially unchanged for the subsequent 22 weeks of semistarvation &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #19:1>
A 16 per cent fall is , however , not so small , particularly when one takes account of the probable preferential loss of muscle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #20:1>
Therefore it is logical to look at two of the main components of BMR , protein turnover and ion-pumping , to see how far they might contribute to such a reduction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #21:1>
Protein turnover
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #22:1>
As I said at the beginning of this paper , where there is no variability there is no capacity for adaptation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #23:1>
It is therefore relevant that quite a large range of variation has been observed , perhaps two-fold , in the rates of protein turnover of different individuals ( Waterlow , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #24:1>
We do not know the advantages or handicaps of having a high or low rate of whole body protein turnover , nor do we know the effects on it of a habitually low energy intake .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #25:1>
We are currently engaged in measuring these rates in Professor Shetty 's subjects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #26:1>
It is generally accepted that protein turnover may account for 15 - 20 per cent of the BMR ( Waterlow , 1986 ) , although Jackson ( 1985 ) suggested that it may be more .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #27:1>
A reduction of one quarter , which is well within the observed range of inter-individual variation , could thus produce a saving of five per cent of the BMR .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #28:1>
It should be noted also that the rate of protein turnover is influenced by the activity of the thyroid gland .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #29:1>
This has been shown for whole body turnover in obese patients treated with triiodothyronine ( Nair et al. , 1981 &semi; Wolman et al. , 1985 ) , and for muscle protein turnover in the rat ( Jepson , Bates &ampersand; Millward , 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #30:1>
Ion-pumping
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #31:1>
The concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium inside and outside cells are very different , and it takes energy to maintain these concentra<l>tion gradients .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #32:1>
What are colloquially called &lsquo; pumps &rsquo; keep sodium out and potassium in .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #33:1>
We know the energy cost of pumping one mole , but it is unknown how much energy is used for this process per unit time in the body as a whole .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #34:1>
Early estimates ( Edelman , 1974 ) put the cost of Na + - K + pumping at 20 - 45 per cent of BMR .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #35:1>
More recent studies ( Biron et al. , 1979 ) suggest a much lower figure a maximum of 12 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #36:1>
The concentration of free calcium inside cells is lower than outside by about two orders of magnitude , and it is of crucial importance for many vital processes that the internal concentration should be maintained at the correct level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #37:1>
The cost of calcium pumping may be substantial , but I know of no values for the whole body .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #38:1>
As in the case of protein turnover , Na + - K + pumping is affected by thyroid hormones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #39:1>
Apparently they do not alter the efficiency of the pumps , but their number ( Biron et al. , 1979 &semi; Kjeldsen et al. , 1984 ) &semi; in other words , they produce changes in flux rate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #40:1>
Here again , the capacity to vary provides opportunities for adaptation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #41:1>
Futile cycles
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #42:1>
There are a number of metabolic reactions which go backwards and forwards , producing no net chemical work but only heat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #43:1>
It has been calculated that six of these reactions that have been fairly well char<l>acterized might normally account for 1-15 per cent of the BMR ( Reeds , Fuller &ampersand; Nicholson , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #44:1>
There is evidence in at least one case of the activity being greatly reduced when an animal is starved ( Challiss , Arch &ampersand; Newsholme , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #45:1>
It has been suggested that these cycles , which appear simply to waste energy , have in fact a regulatory function ( Newsholme , Challiss &ampersand; Crabtree , 1984 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #46:1>
If so , reducing the waste of energy as an adaptation to starvation would be at the cost of losing some of the capacity for fine control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #47:1>
Efficiency of ATP production
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #48:1>
The amount of ATP produced per unit of food energy used or of oxygen consumed varies a little with the nature of the foodstuff oxidized and the route of oxidation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #49:1>
Elia &ampersand; Livesey ( 1988 ) give a very comprehensive and up-to-date review .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #50:1>
A typical Third World diet , being low in fat and protein , would be about three per cent more economical than a Western diet .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #51:1>
The difference is not large , but every little helps .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #52:1>
The difference will be increased if , on the Western diet , some of the carbohydrate is cycled through fat before being oxidized .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #53:1>
This process involves an energy loss of some 20 per cent ( Milligan , 1971 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #54:1>
These calculations are based on conventional values obtained in vitro for the P : O ratio ( moles ATP formed per mole oxygen used ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #55:1>
In recent years it has become apparent that this process may not always be maximally efficient and that there may be some degree of &lsquo; uncoupling &rsquo; of oxygen utilization and ATP formation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #56:1>
The result would be a greater loss of oxidative energy as heat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #57:1>
The extreme example of uncoupling is shown by brown adipose tissue , which produces heat without any formation of ATP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #58:1>
This tissue probably does not have any important function in adult human subjects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #59:1>
However , the basis exists for speculating that in some people oxidation might be more tightly coupled than in others , so that food energy would be used more efficiently .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #60:1>
St&uumlaut;cki ( 1980 ) , in experi<l>ments in vitro , has shown that maximum rate and maximum efficiency are incompatible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #61:1>
He uses the analogy of a car : to cover a distance at the least cost of fuel you do not drive as fast as you can .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #62:1>
We reach exactly the same conclusion as in our consideration of the energy cost of walking ( Fig. 2.1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #63:1>
Efficiency of ATP utilization
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #64:1>
For the reactions considered so far the relationship between the amount of ATP used and the amount of chemical work done is probably fixed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #65:1>
Thus it is thought to take one mole of ATP to pump out three moles of sodium ions , two being exchanged for potassium , and four moles to bind together two moles of amino acids in the synthesis of protein .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #66:1>
Even though we may not know the numbers exactly , they are fixed by the nature of the chemical reactions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #67:1>
To return to our analogy : there is probably no way of getting better value for the money spent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #68:1>
However , muscular contraction provides an exception that is related to mechanical rather than chemical work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #69:1>
The energy that makes the components of a muscle fibre slide along each other when the muscle exerts a pull is ultimately derived from the breakdown of ATP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #70:1>
The relation between the force developed or the amount of mechanical work done to the amount of ATP used is called the contraction coupling efficiency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #71:1>
It has long been known that muscle fibres can be divided into two principle principal types : the slow-twitch ( ST ) , oxidative or red fibres and the fast-twitch ( FT ) glycolytic or white fibres , with some intermediate types ( see Saltin &ampersand; Gollnick , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #72:1>
Some muscles are functionally slow and have a predominance of ST fibres &semi; others are fast and contain mainly FT , fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #73:1>
We can call these ST and FT muscles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #74:1>
Many muscles , however , contain a mixture of both types of fibre .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #75:1>
People differ in the pattern of fibres in their muscles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #76:1>
For example , the proportion of ST fibres in the vastus lateralis muscle , measured in biopsies , has been found to vary from 10 to over 80 per cent ( Grindrod , Round &ampersand; Rutherford , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #77:1>
It is generally considered that these patterns are genetically determined .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #78:1>
The relevance of this to the problem of adaptation is that ST fibres have a higher contraction coupling efficiency than FT fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #79:1>
In muscles contracting isometrically , so that no external work is done , ST muscles use less ATP per unit tension developed ( Gibbs &ampersand; Gibson , 1972 &semi; Wendt &ampersand; Gibbs , 1973 &semi; Awan &ampersand; Goldspink , 1972 &semi; Goldspink , 1975 &semi; Crow &ampersand; Kushmerik , 1982 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #80:1>
In isotonic contractions , where the muscle is allowed to shorten , the efficiency depends not only on the fibre type but also on the speed of shortening .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #81:1>
When muscles of different species were com<l>pared an inverse relationship was found between intrinsic speed of shortening and biochemical efficiency ( Nwoye &ampersand; Goldspink , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #82:1>
In the intact animal , as the rate of work increases , more and more FT fibres are recruited ( Armstrong &ampersand; Laughlin , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #83:1>
One would expect this to be accompanied by a decrease in biochemical efficiency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #84:1>
In man a positive correlation has been found between the percentage of ST fibres in the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh and the force developed in an isometric contraction ( Young , 1984 &semi; Grindrod et al. , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #85:1>
In what can only be described as a heroic experiment Suzuki ( 1979 ) identified two groups , each of three subjects &semi; the ST group had 70-90 per cent of ST fibres in the vastus lateralis &semi; the other group ( FT ) had only 15-30 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #86:1>
Efficiency of work was measured as &Delta; work / &Delta; oxygen consumption on the bicycle ergometer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #87:1>
At 60 rpm there was no difference in efficiency between the two groups &semi; at higher speeds the FT group was more efficient .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #88:1>
It is a pity that in this experiment no tests were made at slower speeds and greater work loads .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #89:1>
In conditions of low energy intake and in hypothyroidism a reduction has been reported in the proportion and diameter of FT fibres ( Russell et al. , 1984 &semi; Wiles et al. , 1979 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #90:1>
In hypothyroidism this appears to be accompanied by an increase in the contraction coupling efficiency ( Wiles et al. , 1979 &semi; Leijendekker , van Hardeveld &ampersand; Kassenaar , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #91:1>
It is of interest in this connection that experimentally thyroidectomy has been found to cause a much greater depression of protein synthesis in the FT muscle gastrocnemius than in the ST soleus ( Brown &ampersand; Millward , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #92:1>
Perhaps slow muscles and fibres are selectively preserved in conditions in which the metabolic rate is reduced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-024 #93:1>
This would cer<l>tainly make sense from the point of view of adaptation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #1:1>
CHAPTER TWO Introduction to tropisms
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #2:1>
2.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #3:1>
2.1.1 Types and terminology
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #4:1>
A tropism is a directional response of a plant organ to a directional stimulus in the environment , usually through some form of differential growth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #5:1>
The definitive characteristic is that the pattern of growth and direction of response bear some strong relationship to the direction of the stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #6:1>
Various terms are used to describe the direction of response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #7:1>
If the stimulated organ becomes oriented in the same plane as the stimulus , it is described as an orthotropic , or more rarely , a parallelotropic , response , and is said to be positive if it is towards the source of the stimulus , and negative if it is away from the stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #8:1>
The responses of seedlings are usually orthotropic and wholly positive or negative , but those of more mature tissues show greater variation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #9:1>
If the organ becomes oriented at an angle to the direction of stimulation , as in lateral branches and some roots , the response is described as being positively or negatively plagio<l>tropic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #10:1>
And if the orientation is at right angles to the stimulus , it is termed diatropic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #11:1>
Tropisms are named fairly obviously according to the types of environ<l>mental factor that initiate them , the major ones being gravitropism ( or geotropism ) and phototropism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #12:1>
In general the main axis of a plant is orthogravitropic , with negatively orthotropic stems and positive roots &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #13:1>
lateral branches usually show some degree of negative plagiogravitro<l>pism , and secondary roots are often positively plagiogravitropic &semi; rhi<l>zomes
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #14:1>
rhizomes and other horizontally growing organs are diagravitropic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #15:1>
However , there are many exceptions to these generalities ( see Ch. 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #16:1>
The aerial parts of all plants generally show some form of positive phototropism , whereas only some types of roots and subterranean organs are negatively phototropic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #17:1>
The term phototropism strictly refers to the directional growth of an organ in response to blue light .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #18:1>
However , light is of such crucial importance for plant growth and development that there are , in fact , several additional means by which it can influence the orientation of plant organs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #19:1>
These include heliotropism , or sun<l->tracking , which is shown by many leaves and flowers and which often involves changes in cell turgor rather than growth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #20:1>
They also include red-light-induced &lsquo; shade effects &rsquo; on the growth of higher plants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #21:1>
And red and blue light also have strong positive and diatropic effects on the sporophyte and gametophyte generations of lower plants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #22:1>
These aspects are discussed further in Chapter 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #23:1>
Directional responses to physical contact or touch , thigmotropism ( in the older literature &lsquo; haptotropism &rsquo; ) , play an important role in the orien<l>tation of many plant organs ( Ch. 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #24:1>
These are most apparent in certain specialized organs , such as the tendrils of some climbing plants and the trapping organs of insectivorous species .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #25:1>
However , over 100 years ago Charles Darwin pointed out that this type of response is also generally present in roots .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #26:1>
He maintained that roots are negatively thigmotropic ( bend away from contact ) in the region immediately behind the tip but show a positive response ( bend towards contact ) in regions further from the tip , and suggested that such behaviour helps the root to wriggle through the soil while maintaining nutritional contact with soil particles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #27:1>
Another tropism that may be of widespread occurrence , and which is also particularly evident in roots , is a directional response to injury , traumatropism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #28:1>
When injured , roots bend away from the side that is injured .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #29:1>
Stems , on the other hand , curve towards the injured side .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #30:1>
These wound responses are not due simply to mechanical damage or to cell shrinkage , say by the loss of water , but involve definite growth reactions in regions some distance from the site of injury ( see Ch. 6 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #31:1>
Other tropisms are known , but in some cases these are not common to all types of plants and in others their significance to general plant development is not clear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #32:1>
For example , directional responses to chemi<l>cal stimuli , chemotropism , are important aids to sexual reproduction in motile lower plants and in many fungi .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #33:1>
But in higher plants directional growth responses to chemical factors seem to be limited , perhaps , to the growth of the pollen tube down the floral style towards the ovary , and to the behaviour of trapping organs in some insectivorous plants ( see Ch. 6 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #34:1>
Again , directional responses of the roots of some plants towards water , hydrotropism , have been described , but the general occurrence of this phenomenon under field conditions has not really been estab<l>lished ( see Ch. 6 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #35:1>
And directional responses to linearly polarized light , polarotropism , have been described in simple organs such as algal cells and protonemal filaments of mosses ( see Ch. 4 ) , but the significance of this phenomenon to the directional growth of multicellular organs in natural light is not clear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #36:1>
The pattern and direction of growth in many plant organs can also be influenced by electric and magnetic fields , but again the significance of such responses to general plant development is not clear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #37:1>
In the older literature even more responses have been named as tropisms , but do not seem to be reliably established .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #38:1>
For example , &lsquo; thermotropic &rsquo; responses of seedlings have occasionally been noted ( Aletsee 1962a ) , but usually the studies have not been carried out under controlled conditions and in some cases the actual nature of the causal factor as being heat , rather than , say , loss of water , has not been confirmed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #39:1>
And directional growth responses of some fungal hyphae seemingly in response to the direction of water flow , &lsquo; rheotropism &rsquo; , may in fact be due to the presence of chemical factors in the flowing water ( see Ch. 6 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #40:1>
There is one further important response or form of behaviour that occurs in all tropisms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #41:1>
The term &lsquo; autotropism &rsquo; is used to describe the straightening reaction that must take place (
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #42:1>
if it did not , a tropically responding organ would eventually form a loop ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #43:1>
At first glance , this straightening of tropically curving organs may seem to be due simply to some sort of equalization of the tropic stimulus as the organ achieves an equilibrium position .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #44:1>
However , there are several reasons for this being an unlikely explanation of autotropism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #45:1>
For example , in the case of gravitropic curvature , the straightening response continues to occur after the plant has been placed on a rotating klinostat ( i.e. after gravitational influences have been experimentally equalized ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #46:1>
Secondly , the growth events that underlie the straightening response of a gravistimulated organ are actually initiated well before the organ becomes vertical , and in some cases in regions of the organ that never become vertical ( Firn &ampersand; Digby 1979 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #47:1>
And , finally , autotropic straightening occurs not just in gravitropism but in all tropic responses , including thigmotropic tendril coils if the contact stimulus is removed [
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #48:1>
its apparent absence in some cases of coleoptile phototropism ( Pickard 1985b , Nick &ampersand; Sch&aumlaut;fer 1988 ) , but its presence in others ( Firn 1986a ) , may be due to differences of definition ] .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #49:1>
Thus although autotropism is based upon distinct and specific growth reactions , it is unlike other tropisms in that it is not a response to an external directional stimulus .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #50:1>
It may be that the autotropic &lsquo; stimulus &rsquo; is simply a mechanical effect that results from tissue strains within a curved organ , which stimulate appropriate growth reactions until they are balanced out (
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #51:1>
see also the discussions on the possible growth regulatory effects of tissue tensions and compressions in relation to circumnutation , Section 1.3.2 &semi; gravitropism Section 3.2.1 &semi; and responses to mechanostimuli , Section 5.3.2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #52:1>
However , whatever their origins , autotropic growth reactions are significant components of every tropic response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #53:1>
( The term &lsquo; autotropism &rsquo; is also used in a slightly different sense to describe the directional growth responses of fungal hyphae to the presence of other hyphae of the same individual or the same species , see Ch. 6 . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #54:1>
2.1.2 Stages in the tropic response
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #55:1>
Like any other environmentally regulated phenomenon , a tropism can be regarded as a catenary system , i.e. as a chain of events which are causally linked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #56:1>
The stages involved can be somewhat arbitrarily categorized as : stimulus reception &arrow; physiological mediation &arrow; biological response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #57:1>
Such a sequential representation may be somewhat misleading since the system really involves not distinct and separate stages , but continuous and overlapping processes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #58:1>
For example , usually stimulation is still being received while other events , including the final responses , have already been induced , and in fact &lsquo; the temporal interweaving of the several aspects of ( the system ) forms a tight mesh &rsquo; ( Pickard 1985a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #59:1>
Nevertheless , this traditional sequential representation is still useful for purposes of description and discussion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #60:1>
Stimulus reception
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #61:1>
This stage consists of the action of a particular environmental factor upon a biological receptor , as a result of which the receptor is altered in some way .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #62:1>
Implicit in the concept of a receptor being altered by the energy form of a particular type of stimulus is the principle that there must be appropriate types of receptors for the different types of environmental stimuli , i.e. there must be gravireceptors , photoreceptors , mecha<l>noreceptors , and so forth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #63:1>
However , unlike the sensory receptors in most animals , plant receptors are not specialized cells or organs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #64:1>
Instead they are structures , or even simply molecules , that are possibly associated with some part of the cell membrane system , either on the cell surface or within the cell itself ( Bentrup 1979 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #65:1>
The actual identity of the receptor for any environmentally stimulated movement in higher plants has not been unequivocally established yet , although , because of the characteristic specificity of light absorption in relation to its action , something is known about the general type of pigment molecule that must act as the phototropic receptor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #66:1>
In their sensory interactions with environmental stimuli , organisms must deal with what has been called the &lsquo; sensory paradox &rsquo; ( Hertel 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #67:1>
That is , the sensory systems must be able to respond over extremely large ranges of stimulus intensity ( e.g. around six orders of magnitude in the light environment ) , and yet they must be able to detect very small differences in levels of stimulation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #68:1>
The solution to this paradox often seems to involve the phenomenon of sensory adaptation , in which responsiveness or sensitivity to a certain level of stimulus becomes less marked with continued exposure to that level of stimulus (
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #69:1>
a very hot bath rapidly becomes less uncomfortable without the temperature of the bath changing to any great extent ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #70:1>
The mechanisms responsible for such adaptation are not always clear , and may be due to changes in the receptors themselves or in some other part of the receptor-response system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #71:1>
Nor is it clear to what extent this phenomenon is generally involved in the tropic responses of higher plants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #72:1>
However , it is defi<l>nitely a feature of the phototropic behaviour of the Phycomyces sporangio<l>phore , which can respond over a range of light intensities covering nine orders of magnitude ( Dennison 1979 , Hertel 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #73:1>
Another aspect of stimulus reception that is of particular importance in directional responses is the means by which the direction or grandient of stimulus is detected .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #74:1>
There are two quite different methods of achieving this , known respectively as &lsquo; temporal sensing &rsquo; and &lsquo; spatial sensing &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #75:1>
In temporal sensing the organism compares the intensity of the stimulus at one point in time with its intensity at another time , and according to any change in intensity an appropriate behavioural response is induced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #76:1>
This method operates in organisms that are not large enough to be able to detect a significant difference in stimulus level within the confines of their own body size .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #77:1>
The mechanism has been particularly well studied in relation to chemosensing in bacteria ( McNab 1979 ) , where a change in concentration of , say , a chemoattractant , induces a transient change in the pattern of flagellar activity and thus a change in the direction of motion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #78:1>
This form of response is discussed further in Section 6.1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #79:1>
Temporal sensing mechanisms are also involved in controlling the responses of ciliated organisms towards chemical and mechanical stimuli ( Taylor &ampersand; Panasenko 1984 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #80:1>
And it is basically a form of temporal sensing that is responsible for the light-directed motion , or phototaxis , of algae such as Euglena ( Carlile 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #81:1>
In this organism , flagellar activity is controlled by a pigment complex which consists of a photoreceptor and a screening pigment , the eyespot .
<ICE-GB:W2A-025 #82:1>
The eyespot casts a shadow on the photoreceptor and thus flagellar activity is temporally regulated accord<l>ing to the constantly changing relationship between the moving cell and the direction of light ( H&aumlaut;der 1979 , Feinleib 1980 ) .

Nerve injury and repair
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #3:1>
Principal author : P.J. Smith
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #4:1>
The cellular anatomy of the peripheral nervous system renders it vulnerable to injury .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #5:1>
The centrally located cell bodies maintain the viability of an enormous peripheral axon process whose length may exceed a metre in comparison to a cell body measured in microns .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #6:1>
The axon terminates distally at a sensory mechanoreceptor or motor end-plate and the function of these structures depends upon the anatomical integrity of the axon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #7:1>
Injury at any point along the length of the axon process produces biochemical and ultrastruc<l>tural changes within the nerve cell body
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #8:1>
and these are more pronounced if proximal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #9:1>
If severe , nerve cell death may result .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #10:1>
In proximal injuries if the nerve cell body survives , it attempts to regenerate a new peripheral axon process .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #11:1>
This is an enor<l>mous task in metabolic terms and proceeds slowly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #12:1>
However , the resulting loss of axonal tissue may exceed the neurone 's capacity for repair .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #13:1>
Nerve cells do not exist in isolation but are grouped together in bundles lying in a connective tissue stroma to form peripheral nerves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #14:1>
Prolifer<l>ation of the connective tissue elements occurs at the site of nerve injury as in other tissues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #15:1>
However , in nerves regeneration is essential if there is to be a satisfactory functional outcome .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #16:1>
A conflict may therefore exist between the regener<l>ative and reparative processes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #17:1>
Regeneration is often required over a considerable distance and there is a time lapse between its commencement and eventual recovery of function .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #18:1>
If no clinical signs of recovery are apparent , the surgeon must consider intervention before the peripheral mechanoreceptor and effector sites become irre<l>versibly altered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #19:1>
However , the information derived from clinical examination becomes apparent too slowly to indicate those cases which require re-exploration to achieve the best results .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #20:1>
Assessment of clinical recovery
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #21:1>
In judging the progress of nerve regeneration , reliance is placed upon the advancing Tinel sign .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #22:1>
This is difficult to detect until approximately 2 or 3 months after injury , due to the rate of axonal regeneration occurring at the repair site .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #23:1>
The tech<l>nique of eliciting this sign is discussed in Chapter 20 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #24:1>
Shortly after the advancing Tinel sign reaches the fingertips it disappears .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #25:1>
Tingling develops spontaneously , or in response to gentle stroking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #26:1>
Protective sensation is established when the patient withdraws from painful or hot stimuli .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #27:1>
Discriminating sensation may then re-establish itself in which the patient is capable of differen<l>tiating between textures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #28:1>
Once this has been established , assessment of the postinjury periph<l>eral innervation density may be made by a multitude of tests .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #29:1>
Many are time consuming , difficult to perform with precision and require the complete co-operation of an intelligent patient .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #30:1>
The results are difficult to interpret .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #31:1>
No satisfac<l>tory method of objective sensory evaluation as yet exists and there is little scientific evidence avail<l>able upon which decisions can be based .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #32:1>
Anomalous innervation may suggest motor recovery where none has actually occurred .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #33:1>
Lack of objectivity in the documentation of results renders their assessment and comparison between techniques difficult .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #34:1>
ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #35:1>
At present , there is no universally accepted surgical nomenclature for the various constituents of a peripheral nerve , although a long-accepted anatomical terminology has been based on micro<l>scopic findings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #36:1>
The use of the electron micro<l>scope has clarified the anatomical situation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #37:1>
The fundamental unit of any peripheral nerve is the axon process ( Fig. 8.1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #38:1>
Sensory axons conduct impulses from peripheral receptors towards nerve cell bodies which lie in the dorsal root ganglia .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #39:1>
Motor axons conduct impulses from the anterior horn cells to motor end-plates distally .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #40:1>
Conduction in axons may occur in both directions but transmission between neurones across synapses is normally in one direction only .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #41:1>
The mainten<l>ance of axonal function depends upon a constant flow of axoplasm ( &lsquo; axon transport &rsquo; ) produced by the nerve cell body .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #42:1>
Axoplasm flow is a bidirec<l>tional activity bringing nutrients to the distal nerve as well as returning metabolites.
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #43:1>
The axon is surrounded by a single layer of Schwann cells .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #44:1>
The cytoplasm of the Schwann cell wall ( a trilami<l>nar unit membrane ) comprises a multilayered lipoprotein sandwich and is referred to as myelin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #45:1>
This acts as an insulating body .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #46:1>
At points of contact between adjacent Schwann cells , there are gaps which allow contact between the bare axonal process and the surrounding extracellular fluid .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #47:1>
Depolarisation can only occur at these uninsulated areas and thus nerve conduction involves electrical jumps from one uninsulated area to the next .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #48:1>
This form of conduction is called saltatory conduction and the bare areas are known as the &lsquo; nodes of Ranvier &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #49:1>
It is the most rapid method of conduc<l>tion and is only possible in lamellated or myelinated fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #50:1>
One or more axons may lie within an endo<l>neurial tube .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #51:1>
This is a connective tissue tubule , the walls of which are formed by networks of delicate collagen fibrils and homogeneous ground substance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #52:1>
The endoneuriaI tubule and its contents comprise a nerve fibre .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #53:1>
Such nerve fibres pursue a sinuous course within the nerve .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #54:1>
Mild stretching of the nerve merely straightens these fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #55:1>
Fibre branching also occurs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #56:1>
Groups of fibres are collected together and surrounded by a dense and strong sheath of connective tissue - the perineu<l>rium .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #57:1>
This unit is a nerve fascicle and each fascicle contains a variable number of fibres and thus they are of differing diameters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #58:1>
Groups of fascicles are collected within a sheath of loose connective tissue called the inner epineurium and the outer surface of the nerve is surrounded by a slightly denser collection of the same material , the outer epineu<l>rium ( Fig. 8.2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #59:1>
The fibres within a mixed peripheral nerve can be classified into three groups on the basis of diameter and conduction rate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #60:1>
The largest ( 1&mu;m to 20&mu;m in diameter ) and the most rapidly conducting are the A fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #61:1>
These are myelinated and are subdivided into four groups , one of which , the A beta fibre , is responsible for transmitting moving light touch sensibility .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #62:1>
The fibres of group B are found in the autonomic nervous system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #63:1>
C fibres are small diameter fibres which are slowly conducting and transmit impulses concerned with the appreciation of pain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #64:1>
Such sensibility is also transmitted by the A delta fibres
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #65:1>
( see Table 8.1 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #66:1>
TYPES OF INJURY
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #67:1>
Nerve injuries have been classified into various grades and these are discussed below .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #68:1>
However the surgeon must decide -
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #69:1>
will the lesion recover spontaneously
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #70:1>
or does the structural damage to the nerve require repair ? figure 8.3
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #71:1>
Neuropraxia ( first degree injury ) may be caused by pressure and produces a localised physiological block .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #72:1>
There may be ultrastructural alterations detectable only by electron microscopy such as myelin intussusception ( Fig. 8.3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #73:1>
These block<l>ages can be transient and rapid spontaneous recovery may be expected with return of full function .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #74:1>
Axonotmesis ( second degree injury ) leads to peripheral axon death .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #75:1>
A series of changes occurs which are histologically described as Wallerian degeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #76:1>
The endoneurial tubules however remain intact and regenerating axons will inevi<l>tably pass down their appropriate tubules , if regeneration occurs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #77:1>
Lesions such as these should be capable of a good recovery in the long term .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #78:1>
Neurotmesis ( third , fourth and fifth degree injuries ) is associated with disruption of the gross internal architecture of the nerve .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #79:1>
In third degree injuries , the endoneuriaI tubules are disrupted
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #80:1>
but fascicular continuity remains .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #81:1>
Fascicular disrup<l>tion may occur ( fourth degree injury ) or there may be total neural resulting in a complete division ( fifth degree injury ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #82:1>
There is little therapeutic relevance in differentiating between third , fourth and fifth degree injuries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #83:1>
These degrees of neurotmesis indicate the state of a nerve that has been either completely divided or subjected to such serious internal disorganisation that spon<l>taneous regeneration is impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #84:1>
Neurotmesis may be caused by laceration , traction injury , injec<l>tion of noxious drugs or ischaemia .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #85:1>
From the clinician 's point of view , it is important to realise that neurotmesis and axonotmesis are clinically indistinguishable in the early phases , but electrical testing may help to ascertain which of these lesions will recover spontaneously , as early surgical intervention is indicated for the remainder .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #86:1>
The neurone 's response is governed by the severity and level of the injury . figure 8.4
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #87:1>
Provided the cell does not die , hypertrophy of the nerve cell body occurs during the first week in preparation for axon regeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #88:1>
The intracellular RNA frag<l>ments within 24 hours of injury ( chromatolysis ) ( Fig. 8.4 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #89:1>
At the site of injury , the divided nerve stumps swell as axoplasmic flow continues for a short while .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #90:1>
Proximal to the site of injury , the axon degenerates to a varying extent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #91:1>
Schwann cell proliferation commences in 48-72 hours and axon sprouting has begun by the fourth day .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #92:1>
Fibro<l>blastic proliferation is the most prominent feature at this stage arising from the connective tissue components of the nerve .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #93:1>
Minimal tension at the repair interface may encourage the moulding and linear orientation of collagen , but excessive tension will prejudice regeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #94:1>
Three weeks after injury , axon regeneration predominates ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #95:1>
but these regenerating axons may be trapped in the proliferating fibroblastic tissue at the nerve inter<l>face , thus forming a neuroma .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #96:1>
In the distal stump , oedema immediately follows injury .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #97:1>
The whole of the distal axon undergoes Wallerian degeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #98:1>
It fragments within 2-3 days of injury
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #99:1>
and by the second week no histological trace of the axon is left .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #100:1>
This may be due to the accumulation of metabolites causing a breakdown of lysosomes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #101:1>
Myelin sheath disrup<l>tion occurs and the Schwann cells phagocytose the fragmented myelin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #102:1>
Schwann cell proliferation produces cords of cells filling the collapsing endo<l>neurial tubules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #103:1>
At the distal nerve stump , the Schwann cells and fibroblasts proliferate , producing a swelling which contains a mass of scar tissue containing no neural elements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #104:1>
By convention it is termed a glioma .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #105:1>
The endoneurial tubules display their elastic properties by instant recoil after nerve division .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #106:1>
Prolonged delay , prior to repair , undoubtedly contributes to chronic short<l>ening and narrowing of the endoneuriaI tubules leading to a reduction in fascicular size .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #107:1>
The degree of re-extension possible at a later date is unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #108:1>
Changes following nerve division occur in the peripheral effector sites at the neuromuscular junctions , in the muscle itself , and at the sensory mechanoreceptor sites .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #109:1>
The distal endoneurial tubules and motor end-plates are relatively normal for the first 3 months following injury .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #110:1>
As time passes , the motor end-plates become increasingly distorted due to connective tissue proliferation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #111:1>
There is progressive shrinkage of muscle fibres , but these are capable of reinnervation for up to 3 years after denervation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #112:1>
During this time muscle atrophy is associated with proliferation of connec<l>tive tissue within the muscle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #113:1>
As time passes , the degree of expected functional recovery diminishes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #114:1>
After 3 years muscle fibre disorganisation is estab<l>lished to such a degree that rennervation reinnervation at this stage is unlikely to be followed by any functional recovery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #115:1>
Within 3 days of injury changes may be noted in Meissner corpuscles , and within 2 weeks of injury nerve terminals can no longer be demon<l>strated within these corpuscles .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #116:1>
Progressive shrinkage of the sensory corpuscles occurs and the regenerating axon may have increasing difficulty in penetration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #117:1>
Sensory recovery is dependent upon reinnervation of pre-existing corpuscles rather than on the development of new ones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #118:1>
There are four phases of regeneration :
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #119:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #120:1>
The phase of delay .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #121:1>
During this period protein synthesis is occurring in the cell bodies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #122:1>
The duration of this quiescent stage depends on the severity of the injury and the distance from the nerve cell body .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #123:1>
During the phase of delay , there are no detectable changes in the patient 's clinical condition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #124:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #125:1>
Axon penetration of the nerve interface ( the contact surface between the repaired nerve ends ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #126:1>
Axon sprouting occurs from the proximal nerve end and must penetrate the fibrous tissue present at the nerve interface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #127:1>
The sprouting commences just proximal to the area of retrograde myelin degeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #128:1>
Many sprouts are formed
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #129:1>
and the number of small axons attempting to cross the scar tissue at the interface greatly exceeds the number of axons present in the nerve proximally .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #130:1>
The pres<l>ence of scarring at the nerve interface or the of a large gap will diminish the likelihood of axons entering the distal endoneurial tubules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #131:1>
They are already collapsed but this is reversible at this stage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #132:1>
Nonetheless , the smaller fibres may be more successful in penetrating the endoneurial tubules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #133:1>
This may explain why there appears to be a recovery of pain and temperature sensation prior to the re-establishment of moving light touch .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #134:1>
In the long term , many patients are left with protective sensation but no discriminating ability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #135:1>
3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #136:1>
Distal axon regeneration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #137:1>
Once the nerve interface has been penetrated and the distal endo<l>neurial tubules contain growing axons , their rate of advancement depends on the level of nerve injury .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #138:1>
Proximally , the axons advance more rapidly but their progress is distally reduced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #139:1>
The rate of advancement may be altered by external factors such as the chemical milieu .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #140:1>
It is known that steroids slow this rate and ( T3 ) tri-iodotyro<l>sine and Nerve Growth Factor may increase it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #141:1>
In general axon advancement occurs at an approxi<l>mate rate of 1 mm per day distal to the repair site .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #142:1>
It is during this phase of distal axon growth that the Tinel sign is most useful .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #143:1>
There is normally a latent period of 3-4 weeks before this is detect<l>able .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #144:1>
As the axons advance , myelination proceeds in a centrifugal manner .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #145:1>
The regenerating axons reconnect with their end-organs and the axon diameter subsequently enlarges .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #146:1>
However , even when satisfactory reinnervation occurs in this manner , absolute measurements of nerve conduc<l>tion velocity show that there is a permanent reduction to perhaps 20-60% of normal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #147:1>
4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #148:1>
The phase of functional recovery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #149:1>
Function returns to a variable extent after end-organ re<l>innervation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-026 #150:1>
Sensory re-education may improve the patient 's ability to interpret sensations through fewer innervated receptors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #1:1>
5.5
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #2:1>
Secretion and metabolism
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #3:1>
Release by exocytosis is common to all protein secretory cells , including peptidergic neurones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #4:1>
Release studies are conveniently performed in vitro using either small slices of brain , or synapto<l>somal preparations ( pinched-off nerve endings ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #5:1>
This type of study allows more careful control of the external medium than can be obtained in vivo .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #6:1>
The release of all neuropeptides has an absolute requirement for calcium and can be evoked by depolar<l>isation , for example by increasing extracellular K+ concentrations ( Figure 5.3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #7:1>
It is also possible to modify secretion with other transmitters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #8:1>
One early example was the demonstration that opioids would depress substance P release from trigeminal slices ( Iversen et al. , 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #9:1>
Recent approaches to the study of release in vivo , have involved push-pull cannulae or perfusion through dialysis fibres inserted into the brain. figure 5.3
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #10:1>
The great advantage of these methods is that secretion can be studied in situ , although the quantities of peptide released are frequently very small .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #11:1>
Proteolytic enzymes that degrade neuropeptides are widely distributed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #12:1>
Much of the available information on the metabolism of neuropeptides is based on studies of peptide degradation by different fractions of brain homogenates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #13:1>
The results provide a rational basis for the development of peptide analogues that are resistant to degradation , and they also allow the development of inhibitors of enzyme action that can be used in vivo .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #14:1>
Some of the most intensively studied peptides in this regard are the opioid pentapeptides , Leu and Met enkephalin ( Tyr 1 - Gly 2 - Gly 3 - Phe 4 - Met 5 or Leu 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #15:1>
There are several enzymes in the brain that degrade these peptides &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #16:1>
of special importance are those that cleave the peptide bonds between Tyr 1 - Gly 2 and Gly 3 - Phe 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #17:1>
The enzyme involved in the latter cleavage has been studied by sev<l>eral research groups - some of whom called it enkephalinase .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #18:1>
It is , however , the same as an enzyme that was first found in the kidney and termed endopeptidase 24.11 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #19:1>
it degrades many differ<l>ent peptides by cleaving to the N-terminal side of hydrophobic residues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #20:1>
Inhibitors of this enzyme , e.g. thiorphan , are able to potentiate the action of opioid peptides because they block de<l>gradation and so increase peptide concentrations in vivo .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #21:1>
The enzyme(s) cleaving the Tyr-Gly bond appears to account for a high proportion of the total enkephalin degradation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #22:1>
Cleavage at this site is sensitive to substitutions in the Gly 2 position of the peptide chain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #23:1>
Thus replacing glycine in position two with D -alanine produces an analogue that is resistant to degradation but is still biologically active &semi; such analogues are better able to reach receptors ( and so are active in lower doses ) and they also pro<l>duce longer lasting responses than the native pentapeptides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #24:1>
Other substitutions also increase resistance to degradation but it should be remembered that they can also change affinity for different types of opioid receptors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #25:1>
5.6
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #26:1>
Receptors and antagonists
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #27:1>
Like other water-soluble intercellular messenger molecules , pep<l>tides exert their effects by first binding to cell-surface receptors , and thereafter activating one of a relatively small group of trans<l>duction systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #28:1>
Notable amongst these is the regulation of cyc<l>lases and control of intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations , or stimulation of the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol and the consequent liberation of the two intracellular mediators - diacylg<l>lycerol , which activates protein kinase C , and inositol trisphos<l>phate which liberates calcium from endoplasmic reticulum .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #29:1>
The coupling of receptors to second messenger systems depends on G proteins .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #30:1>
But neither these , nor the second messengers them<l>selves are specific for peptides or any other single class of ligand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #31:1>
One of the important actions of intracellular signalling systems is to regulate ion channel opening or closing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #32:1>
Whether or not pep<l>tide receptors are also able to gate ion channels directly , ana<l>logous to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channel is not yet certain , although there is no objection to it in principle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #33:1>
A common feature of many transmitter systems is the occur<l>rence of more than one receptor type &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #34:1>
the multiple receptors for acetylcholine , noradrenaline , and dopamine are all familiar ex<l>amples .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #35:1>
There are also multiple receptor types for many pep<l>tides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #36:1>
In the first instance these can be identified by comparing the rank order of potency of various analogues in different test systems , e.g. bioassays , binding studies , second messenger re<l>sponses &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #37:1>
they can also be characterised by examining the action of different antagonists on a range of agonists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #38:1>
Two examples are worth citing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #39:1>
In the case of the opioids , there are at least three receptor types : mu , kappa , and delta ( Kosterlitz &ampersand; Paterson , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #40:1>
Considerable effort has been devoted to establishing the likely endogenous ligands for the different types of opioid recep<l>tor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #41:1>
The dynorphins are often considered likely ligands for kappa receptors , the enkephalin pentapeptides for delta receptors , while &beta;-endorphin may act at both mu and delta .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #42:1>
The distribution of mu and delta receptors generally matches that of the enkepha<l>lins , but the match of kappa receptors and their potential ligands is less impressive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #43:1>
A good example of the significance of the distribution of receptor types is provided by CCK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #44:1>
There are at least two major types of receptor for CCK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #45:1>
One of these , which can be called the peripheral receptor , occurs on pancreatic acinar cells , gall bladder muscle , myenteric neurones , and probably vagal fibres &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #46:1>
these receptors show high affinity for CCK and at least 1000-fold lower affinity for the related peptide gastrin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #47:1>
These receptors are of course exposed both to gastrin and CCK in the blood , and their specificity ensures that they are activated only by CCK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #48:1>
A similar type of receptor may occur in certain discrete regions of the brain &semi; but the predominant CCK binding site in brain , which can be called the central receptor , shows only about 10-50 times lower affinity for gastrin compared with CCK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #49:1>
The CNS receptors are not normally exposed to gastrin and their relatively higher affinity for gastrin does not therefore comprom<l>ise the specificity of their response to CCK .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #50:1>
Physiological studies of peptidergic systems depend on anta<l>gonists and these are still difficult to find .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #51:1>
In the case of substance P and LHRH , useful analogues with antagonist activity have been developed by substituting residues ( often D -amino acids ) in the primary peptide structures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #52:1>
Antagonists that are themselves peptides may be valuable for many experimental studies , but for therapeutic applications they suffer from the disadvantage that they are rapidly degraded , do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier , and are often ineffective when given orally .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #53:1>
These problems may be overcome to varying degrees by developing non-peptide antagonists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #54:1>
The opioid antagonist , naloxone , is a good example that has been known for many years , but in gen<l>eral it has been difficult to develop non-peptide antagonists for neuropeptides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #55:1>
However , remarkable progress has been made recently with substances that antagonise the peripheral type of CCK receptor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #56:1>
Several different types of CCK antagonist have been recognised for some time , but since they have low affinity they have not been suitable for in vivo work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #57:1>
While screening fermentation broths for possible CCK antagonists , a research group at Merck Sharp and Dohme Laboratories discovered a metabolite of the fungus Aspergillus that has weak CCK antagon<l>ist properties and which they named asperlicin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #58:1>
There are similar<l>ities in structure between asperlicin and the benzodiazepines , and on this basis a range of benzodiazepine analogues were screened for CCK antagonist properties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #59:1>
This led to the discovery of an excellent antagonist for peripheral CCK receptors , L364 , 718 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #60:1>
This compound does not interact with the &lsquo; benzodiazepine-receptor &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #61:1>
It is orally active and doses of a few &mu;g produce effective blockade of peripheral CCK receptors for several hours in the rat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #62:1>
5.7
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #63:1>
Peptidergic systems
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #64:1>
An impressive variety of behavioural effects have been described in mammals in response to neuropeptides administered either peripherally ( intravenous or interperitoneally ) or centrally ( into the cerebral ventricles or directly into discrete areas of brain ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #65:1>
Some striking examples are the analgesic effects of opioid pep<l>tides , the actions of CCK in inhibiting food intake , the effects of ACTH and vasopressin fragments on memory and learning , and the effects of LHRH on reproductive behaviour ( see Krieger et al . , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #66:1>
Care is needed in interpreting the physiological significance of findings based on peripheral administration of neuropeptides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #67:1>
It is now clear , for instance , that the actions of peripherally administered peptides may be exerted outside the CNS .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #68:1>
Thus , in the rat , CCK probably inhibits feeding by acting on vagal afferent nerve endings and this effect is independent of the central neurotransmitter function of the peptide .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #69:1>
In the verte<l>brates some of the best examples of peptidergic neuroeffector transmission are found not in the CNS but in the periphery , where it is possible to study in detail the connections and actions of peptidergic neurones .

5.7.1
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #71:1>
Primary afferents and peptides
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #72:1>
Peptides are well represented in primary afferent nerve fibres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #73:1>
Substance P was one of the earliest of these peptides to be studied .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #74:1>
Long before it was isolated and characterised , Lembeck had noted higher concentrations of substance P bioactivity in dorsal , compared with ventral , spinal roots and had raised the idea that this substance might be a transmitter in afferent neurones .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #75:1>
It is now clear that substance P is indeed synthesised in dorsal-root ganglion cells , particularly small diameter cells .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #76:1>
The same neurones also synthesise CGRP ( although there are prob<l>ably further CGRP-containing primary afferents that do not con<l>tain substance P ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #77:1>
other peptides ( somatostatin , VIP , bombesin ) may also be produced in certain primary afferents .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #78:1>
The peptides synthesised in dorsal-root ganglia cells are transported to central terminals in the dorsal horn , where they are released and partici<l>pate in the central transmission of information following A&delta; and C fibre stimulation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #79:1>
Interestingly , however , the major proportion of the material synthesised in these neurones is directed not cen<l>trally but to peripheral terminals .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #80:1>
Axon collaterals of primary afferents that contain substance P and CGRP are found around blood vessels in the skin and joints , and in the gut they occur around myenteric ganglion cells and submucosal blood vessels ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #81:1>
they also make contact with ganglion cells as they pass through the sympathetic prevertebral ganglia .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #82:1>
Stimulation of primary affe<l>rents results not just in the conduction of action potentials to<l>wards the CNS , but also in the release of substance P and CGRP at peripheral terminals .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #83:1>
It has been known for very many years that antidromic stimulation of afferents produces a vasodilator response in the skin and an increase in local blood flow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #84:1>
Both substance P and CGRP have vasodilator actions and are good candidates for this effect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #85:1>
In addition substance P increases capil<l>lary permeability and produces plasma extravasation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #86:1>
These effects are in part direct , but they also involve release of hista<l>mine from mast cells which augments the increase in blood flow and capillary permeability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #87:1>
5.7.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #88:1>
Autonomic neuroeffector transmission
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #89:1>
The combined use of cholinergic and adrenergic antagonists over the last 20 years has produced many examples of so-called &lsquo; non-adrenergic , non-cholinergic transmission &rsquo; in the autonomic ner<l>vous system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #90:1>
Purines were one of the first groups of substances considered as candidate transmitters for these effects &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #91:1>
in addition , though , there is now good evidence that peptides account for many types of autonomic non-adrenergic non-cholinergic trans<l>mission ( Dockray , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #92:1>
A clearcut case is the effect of parasympathetic stimulation on salivery salivary gland function .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #93:1>
Electrical stimulation of the chorda tym<l>pani increases both the flow of saliva and blood flow in the submaxillary gland .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #94:1>
Atropine blocks the flow of saliva indicating cholinergic-muscarinic transmission , but the increase in blood flow remains .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #95:1>
Postganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the saliv<l>ary gland contain both acetylcholine and VIP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #96:1>
By radioimmu<l>noassay of the venous effluent during electrical stimulation , two groups of workers , one in Cambridge , the other in Stockholm , have been able to show release of VIP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #97:1>
One of the actions of VIP is to induce vasodilatation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #98:1>
The atropine-resistant vasodilation can therefore be attributed to the effect of VIP .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #99:1>
This is not an isolated example :
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #100:1>
there is evidence of a similar type to suggest that VIP mediates the effect of vagal stimulation on the flow of pancreatic juice in some species , and on the inhibition of gastric motility in the presence of atropine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-027 #101:1>
Other probable peptider<l>gic effects in the gut include substance P mediation of non-cholinergic smooth muscle contraction in the peristaltic reflex , and the release of gastrin by the bombesin-like substance , gastrin releasing peptide .

Leek rust is a major problem in leek crop production in the U.K. ( Dobson , 1986 ) and development of resistant varieties is hampered by uncertainty about the number and taxonomy of rust species occurring on leeks in this country .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #17:1>
A series of autoecious rusts grow on Allium spp. and are known almost entirely as the uredinial and telial stages in the U.K .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #18:1>
The taxonomy of these rusts has a complicated history and has been in a state of flux since Sowerby ( 1810 ) described Uredo porri on leeks and De Candolle ( 1815 ) described Uredo alliorum on A. multiflorum DC. ( syn. A. scorodoprasum L . ) , A. vineale and A. oleraceum , and Uredo ambigua on an unknown Allium species .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #19:1>
The various nomenclatural changes which have taken place are reviewed by G&aumlaut;umann ( 1959 ) , summarizing the work of Schneider ( 1912 ) , Grove ( 1913 ) , von Tavel ( 1932 ) and Goto ( 1933 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #20:1>
G&aumlaut;umann describes three species of rust using telial and teliospore characters , namely Puccinia allii ( DC . ) Rud. with mostly two-celled teliospores in paraphysate telia , Puccinia porri ( Sow . ) Wint. with one- and two-celled teliospores in non-paraphysate telia , and Uromyces ambiguus ( DC . ) L&eacute;v. with one-celled teliospores in non-paraphysate telia .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #21:1>
He also considered the species Puccinia mixta Fuckel to be a synonym of Puccinia porri .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #22:1>
However , lack of telial material on leeks in the U.K. has prevented classification using this system , so that Laundon &ampersand; Waterston ( 1965 ) grouped all the species as P. allii and considered the other names as synonyms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #23:1>
Wilson &ampersand; Henderson ( 1966 ) described U. ambiguus and P. allii as the two species in the U.K. with P. porri and P. mixta ( on chives ) as synonyms of P. allii .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #24:1>
Doherty ( 1981 ) agreed with this system after a detailed literature survey .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #25:1>
Henderson &ampersand; Bennell ( 1979 ) decided that the urediniospore morphology of the rust on leeks was sufficiently different to merit specific rank , and using the description of Savile ( 1961 ) named it P. porri .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #26:1>
In 1983 telia were found on leeks in the U.K. by Uma &ampersand; Taylor ( 1986 ) and Harrison ( 1987 ) , enabling comparison with the continental system , and also correlation between urediniospore and teliospore characters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #27:1>
A special problem for rust taxonomy is that there is often host specialization amongst rust strains within the narrowest taxa defined by morphology .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #28:1>
However the host ranges of the formae speciales are not mutually exclusive and there is a restricted degree of cross-pathogenicity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #29:1>
Host range is not therefore used as a taxonomic criterion &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #30:1>
rust species must be defined by , for example , morphological characters ( Shoemaker , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #31:1>
Major problems in using the rust anamorph , i.e urediniospore stage , taxonomically are that there is often a lack of clear-cut morphological differences and a large amount of variation in quantitative characters often occurs within populations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #32:1>
Characters such as germ pore number or morphology might be assumed to be stable , and therefore &lsquo; good &rsquo; taxonomic characters ( Wilson et al . , 1966 &semi; Cummins &ampersand; Hiratsuka , 1983 ) , but many authors have commented that the germ spores of the Allium rusts are indistinct ( G&aumlaut;umann , 1959 &semi; Wilson et al . , 1966 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #33:1>
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) provides a method of looking for additional morphological characters in the surface features of spores , and has been used extensively in many taxa ( Littlefield &ampersand; Heath , 1979 ) but its accuracy as a measuring device is limited ( Boyde. 1974 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #34:1>
Continuously varying characters such as spore length and width have been shown to vary between pustules , leaves or individual host plants , and also with environmental conditions ( Littlefield , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #35:1>
Some of the problems posed by quantitative characters may be clarified by statistical analysis of appropriate population samples .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #36:1>
Numerical methods have been adapted for use in many fields of taxonomy and found particularly useful where the relationships between organisms are unclear ( Michener &ampersand; Sokal , 1957 &semi; Ibrahim &ampersand; Threlfall , 1966 &semi; Lam &ampersand; Chapman , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #37:1>
Although the concepts described by the original proponents of numerical methods ideally require as many as 50 or 100 characters ( Sokal &ampersand; Sneath , 1963 ) for effective classification , it is possible to use multivariate methods with far fewer characters as long as the limitations of the data are recognized ( Dunn &ampersand; Everitt , 1982 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #38:1>
We have aimed to elucidate the taxonomy of rusts with uredinia and telia on European Allium species by using these methods on isolates from U.K. field populations on several different host species of Allium and relating the results to those from a study of material in U.K. herbaria .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #39:1>
MATERIALS AND METHODS
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #40:1>
Rust material
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #41:1>
Urediniospore and teliospore isolates were obtained from the sources described in Table 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #42:1>
The BIRM. CHIVE and BABNT isolates were selected for most detailed microscopy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #43:1>
For observation by bright field and interference microscopy urediniospores scraped from erumpent pustules and macerated or hand-sectioned telia were mounted in lactic acid and heated to boiling point .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #44:1>
For SEM , dry unfixed urediniospores and sectioned and fractured telia from herbarium material were gold coated before examination under an International Scientific Instruments 100 A SEM . one table
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #45:1>
In order to obtain measurements of quantitative characters of urediniospores , the lactic acid preparations were blotted until the spores were just immobile but not squashed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #46:1>
The length , width , pedicel scar diameter and spine density were measured on the same spores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #47:1>
Length was defined as the largest dimension bisecting the pedicel scar &semi; width was the largest dimension at right angles to the length axis &semi; and the spine density was measured as the number of spines on and within a 100 &mu;m<sp>2 &mu;m2 circle circle about the centre of the spore surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #48:1>
Germ pore numbers were determined on separate samples of the same isolates using the aniline blue squash technique described by Jennings , Ford-Lloyd &ampersand; Butler ( 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #49:1>
Analyses
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #50:1>
Sources of variation in quantitative characters within the BIRM isolate were analysed by means of a one-way nested analysis of variance , ( Sokal &ampersand; Rohlf , 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #51:1>
In order to assess variation between slides , measurements were taken from 10 spores on each of two slides from each of 5 pustules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #52:1>
For assessment of variation between pustules , leaves and plants , measurements were taken ( using one slide per pustule ) from 10 spores from each of 10 pustules , from each of 2 leaves , from each of 2 plants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #53:1>
Comparisons were made between fresh and herbarium material and between different accessions by examining 10 spores from each of 5 pustules per accession , or , where the spore material was in the form of a bulk sample , 10 spores on each of 5 slides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #54:1>
For each accession , germ pore number was counted for 50 spores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #55:1>
Each character was analysed using a one-way analysis of variance of the bulked sample .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #56:1>
Multivariate analysis was performed on the accession means of each character since the analysis requires the data to be derived from the same taxonomic units .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #57:1>
In this case the smallest units possible were the isolates , since the germ pore number was measured on different spores from those yielding the other quantitative measurements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #58:1>
Principal component analysis and cluster analysis utilizing the Euclidean distance measurement and Ward 's method of clustering , were per<l>formed using CLUSTAN ( Programme Library Unit , University of Edinburgh ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #59:1>
RESULTS
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #60:1>
Urediniospore studies
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #61:1>
Uredinia .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #62:1>
The uredinia of the BlRM isolate were usually large rounded or , more commonly , rhomboid in shape .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #63:1>
Single pustules were up to 10 mm long , often confluent forming larger pustules , up to 3 mm wide , and often with concentric rings of secondary pustules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #64:1>
The pustules were often raised , with the epidermis coming away from the underlying tissue , giving a whitish appearance , usually with a pronounced tear along the axis of the leaf exposing areas of orange-brown urediniospores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #65:1>
From the CHIVE isolate the uredinia were also rounded , or elongated along the leaf , up to 10 mm long when confluent with adjacent pustules , but single pustules were more usually only 1-2 mm long .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #66:1>
The epidermis was usually sharply raised above the surrounding tissue , with a single linear tear along the axis of the leaf , exposing the orange-brown urediniospores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #67:1>
The uredinia of the BABNT isolate were 1-4 mm long and 1 mm wide when single , and rhomboid in shape .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #68:1>
In naturally-infected specimens , the pustules were in long stripes , with adjacent stripes confluent , forming pustules 10 mm long .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #69:1>
The epidermis covering the pustule was usually only narrowly slit , to reveal the bright orange urediniospores .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #70:1>
Urediniospore morphology .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #71:1>
There were no major qualita<l>tive morphological differences between urediniospores of the different isolates when observed under the light microscope .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #72:1>
In general the spores were subglobose to ellipsoid or , rarely , globose in shape , with pale yellow to bright orange contents and walls 1-2 &mu;m thick , covered with delicate echinulations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #73:1>
The germ pores were only visible in profile , and appeared as areas of the wall locally thickened on the inner surface , sometimes with a lens-like cap on the outside .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #74:1>
The pedicel scar was visible in profile as a locally flattened area devoid of spines .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #75:1>
Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy ( DIC ) highlighted the walls , spines and germ pores in profile and the spore walls of the BIRM isolate appeared thicker than those of the CHIVE and BABN isolates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #76:1>
The aniline blue squash technique enhanced visibility of the germ pores ( Jennings et al . , 1989 ) and indicated that there was a greater number of smaller germ pores on the BABNT isolate compared with the BHAM and CHIVE isolates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #77:1>
SEM did not reveal additional distinguishing characters ( Figs 1-3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #78:1>
Germ pores were not visible on unimbibed spores of any isolate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #79:1>
The surface of the urediniospores was smooth and covered with scattered spines situated in small depressions on the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #80:1>
In the NVRS isolate the depressions at the bases of the spines were more pronounced , encircled by raised annuli .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #81:1>
At the base of the spore , the spineless pedicel scar had a slight central depression in the position of the septal pore .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #82:1>
Quantitative studies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #83:1>
Spore width was the only character to be affected significantly by slide preparation ( P &smaller-than; 0.001 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #84:1>
when considering variation between plants , leaves and pustules within the BIRM isolate although there were no significant differences in any of the characters between spore samples from different plants , or leaves within plants , the three characters spore length , width and spine density each varied significantly between pustules ( Table 2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #85:1>
Pedicel scar diameter did not differ significantly at any level in the nested analysis of variance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #86:1>
In the comparison of fresh and herbarium material , no significant differences were found in any of the characters between spores from fresh and herbarium samples ( Table 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #87:1>
There were significant differences amongst isolates for each character studied ( Figs 4-9 ) but for two characters the size of the mean difference between groups of isolates was large .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #88:1>
Firstly all non-leek isolates had much higher spine densities than all those from leeks ( Fig. 7 ) and secondly the BABNT and H. 70 isolates had , on average , more germ pores than all the others ( Fig. 8 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #89:1>
In most but not all cases the non-leek isolates had significantly shorter spores and smaller pedicel scar diameters from those from leeks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #90:1>
Multivariate analysis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #91:1>
The percentage variance accounted for by the first principal component was high and considerably greater than the second component .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #92:1>
Figure 10 shows the first and second principal component scatters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #93:1>
The first component broadly split the isolates into &lsquo; leek &rsquo; and &lsquo; non-leek &rsquo; groups .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #94:1>
The second component , though of smaller significance than the first ( accounting for only 15% of the total variance ) has split the BABNT and H. 70 isolates from the chive isolates , leaving the CHIVE , KERR and 6504 isolates dispersed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #95:1>
The major feature of the dendrogram representing the results of the cluster analysis ( Fig. 11 ) is the very clear division into &lsquo; leek &rsquo; and &lsquo; non-leek &rsquo; groups , with a less clear split between the chive isolates and the strongly-linked BABNT and H.70 isolates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #96:1>
The two herbarium chive isolates are more closely linked to each other than to the fresh CHIVE isolate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #97:1>
The leek isolates are generally closely linked with each other , with the exception of the NIAB isolate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #98:1>
Teliospore studies
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #99:1>
Although telia occurred on all non-leek accessions , they were found on only two of the leek isolates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #100:1>
Telia formed only rarely in material infected by the BIRM isolate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #101:1>
On a few occasions telia began to form around the circumference of uredinia , 4-5 weeks after inoculation and did not mature before the leaves senesced .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #102:1>
Mature telia of all isolates were non-erumpent and scattered or tending to coalesce but differed in other characters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #103:1>
In the NVRS isolate , telia appeared as hard , thickened areas , black or more rarely dark grey in colour , slightly pulvinate and occasionally rhomboid in shape , up to 4 mm long and 2 mm wide , along the axis of the leaf .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #104:1>
Telia of the CHIVE isolate formed readily after uredinia , beginning as a dark border to the uredinia , and gradually increasing in size until they replaced it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-028 #105:1>
The telia appeared as flattish , pale grey areas , round or oblong in shape , up to 5 mm long and 2 mm wide .

SUMMARY
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #6:1>
Aircraft measurements of radiative fluxes over the North Sea during a heavy straw-burning pollution episode are presented and compared with results from a radiative transfer model .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #7:1>
The model uses aerosol properties derived from aircraft and satellite measurements , and acceptable agreement with the measured fluxes is obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #8:1>
High levels of aerosol concentration are described , with correspondingly large radiative effects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #9:1>
Boundary layer heating rates of 3 K day<sp>-1</sp> day-1 are measured , and rates of 5-1O K day<sp>-1</sp> day-1 in regions of higher aerosol loading are inferred .

1 . INTRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #11:1>
In recent years there has been considerable interest in the effect of aerosol on solar radiation in the cloud-free atmosphere , much of it directed at influences on global and regional climate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #12:1>
Concern over possible global warming or cooling by anthropogenic aerosols has been heightened , especially by current work on the aftermath of a nuclear exchange as well as the effects of widespread deforestation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #13:1>
Study of the behaviour of radiation and aerosol tends to have been channelled into three areas , with limited interaction &semi; measurement and collation of aerosol properties , modelling of the atmospheric radiation field , and measurement of the radiation field .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #14:1>
A large amount of information is available on the physical and optical properties of aerosol of different types and localities ( Carlson and Benjamin 1980 &semi; Harris and Gerber 1982 &semi; Patterson et al. 1986 &semi; Kilsby and Smith 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #15:1>
However , owing to the extreme variability and range of concentration and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol , it is very difficult to model the radiation field reliably from climatological or standard aerosol properties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #16:1>
Modelling of local and global climatic effects has been carried out using measured and standard aerosol properties ( Braslau and Dave 1973 &semi; Wendling et al. 1985 &semi; Blanchet et al. 1986 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #17:1>
Much uncertainty remains however , and a range of aerosol single scattering albedos exists at which under certain conditions , a line dividing global cooling and warming may be drawn ( Charlock and Sellers 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #18:1>
The ultimate test of such modelling is comparison with measurements of the real radiation field &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #19:1>
unfortunately these are difficult measurements to make with sufficient accuracy .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #20:1>
Radiation profiles allowing flux divergences to be inferred have been measured ( Roach 1961 &semi; De Luisi et al. 1976 &semi; Method and Carlson 1982 &semi; McArthur 1984 &semi; Kitchen and Squires 1984 ) , but seldom with sufficient accuracy or detail to stand comparison with profiles modelled using simultaneous aerosol measurements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #21:1>
This work presents results of an experimental and theoretical study of a highly polluted atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #22:1>
Aircraft and satellite measurements of properties of aerosol resulting from straw-burning are combined in a radiative transfer model to be compared with measured profiles of downward , downward diffuse and upward radiative fluxes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #23:1>
Comparisons are made for the total solar band ( 0.3-3 &mu;m ) , and the visible ( 0.3-0.7 &mu;m ) and near infrared ( 0.7-3 &mu;m ) parts of the solar band and good agreement is obtained throughout .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #24:1>
It is found that although the aerosol has its origin in combustion , it is only a moderate absorber , in contrast with the very strong absorption assumed in some &ldquo; nuclear winter &rdquo; scenarios .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #25:1>
These scenarios assume the production of absorbing aerosol from combustion of material in urban environments rather than combustion of vegetation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #26:1>
Combustion of vegetation undoubtedly forms a substantial part of any nuclear winter scenario , and additionally occurs with increasing frequency in slash and burn agriculture and deforestation world wide .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #27:1>
In this paper , a severe pollution event is described , and boundary layer heating rates of 5-10 K day<sp>-1</sp> day-1 are calculated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #28:1>
The comparison of satellite-derived aerosol optical depths with aircraft measure<l>ments is particularly important , since validation of the satellite technique is essential before it can be used to provide much needed global and temporal information on aerosol .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #29:1>
This information can be used to correct satellite-measured surface parameters ( e.g. vegetation indices and albedo ) as well as being directly included in climate models .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #30:1>
2 . THE EXPERIMENT
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #31:1>
( a ) Conditions
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #32:1>
On 11 and 12 September 1985 the centre of an anticyclone was situated over Denmark and produced clear skies over the North Sea ( Fig. 1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #33:1>
Following a fairly wet summer , a dry spell in early September gave farmers a good opportunity to burn straw and stubble .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #34:1>
Straw-burning fires were widespread over the cereal-growing areas of England , and imagery from NOAA-9 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) channel 3 ( section 2 ( c ) ) shows some 750 separate fires ( &approximate-sign; 1 km<sp>2</sp> km2 resolution ) each consisting of a blazing field ( Fig. 2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #35:1>
The south to south-westerly surface flow carried aerosol from the fires over the North Sea , trapped under two temperature inversions at 920 mb and 1000 mb ( Fig. 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #36:1>
Aerosol concentrations were particularly high near to the east coast of England , with large amounts of pollution also in the eastern North Sea , probably originating in the industrial regions of central Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #37:1>
Since the current day 's smoke plumes appear to have reached only some 70 km distance from the coast ( section 3 ( b ) ) the aerosol in the operating area ( Fig. 1 ) on 12 September must be assumed to be the product of earlier burning on 11 September .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #38:1>
Comparison of the aircraft profiles with radiosonde ascents from Hemsby at 0000 GMT and 1200 GMT that the lowest inversion ( at 1000 mb ) is consistent with that produced by overnight cooling , sustained by the cool ( &approximate-sign; 13 &degree;C ) sea surface &approximate-sign; 13 ‚à´C ) sea surface during its transport to the operating area .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #39:1>
This process resulted in very high concentrations of smoke in the lowest layer , whereas over land and nearer the coast the aerosol was mixed throughout a much deeper boundary layer ( and so was more dilute ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #40:1>
( b ) Aircraft flight pattern and instrumentation
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #41:1>
On 12 September the Hercules of the Meteorological Research flight ( MRF ) performed a sortie around 56&degree;N , 0&degree;W ( between 1050 and 1445 GMT ) -
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #42:1>
the measurement runs of the flight pattern are shown in Fig. 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #43:1>
In addition a series of air sampling runs were performed off the north east coast of England on 11 September .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #44:1>
The Hercules is equipped with meteorological and navigational equipment and other specialised instru<l>mentation ( Readings 1985 ) , of which on this occasion the radiation and aerosol systems were used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #45:1>
The flight pattern consisted of a series of straight and level runs of 20 km length .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #46:1>
Runs were performed at 12 levels between 60 and 8000m with interconnecting profiles for measuring temperature , dewpoint and aerosol properties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #47:1>
Solar radiation measurements were made with four Eppley PSP pyranometers arranged in pairs facing upwards and downwards .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #48:1>
One of each pair was fitted with a clear glass dome ( WG295 transmitting between 0.3 and 3 &mu;m ) and the other with a red dome ( RG715 transmitting between 0.7 and 3 &mu;m ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #49:1>
This arrangement allows measurements to be made in three spectral bands : solar , near infrared and ( by subtraction ) visible .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #50:1>
Total upward and downward fluxes were measured as well as the diffuse component of the downward flux .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #51:1>
The measurement procedure is described in section 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #52:1>
The aerosol scattering coefficient at 0.48 &mu;m was measured continuously using a MRI model 1550 integrating nephelometer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #53:1>
This was calibrated before flight using Freon 12 , Freon 22 and filtered air according to the procedure proposed by Ruby and Waggoner ( 1981 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #54:1>
Number concentration and size spectra in the radius range 0.25-3.75 &mu;m were measured using a PMS Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe ( FSSP ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #55:1>
Aerosol samples were taken on 0.4 &mu;m pore size Nuclepore membrane filters mm pore size Nuclepore membrane filters over 20-minute periods .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #56:1>
These were analysed firstly for mass loading ( &plus-or-minus; 20 &mu;g ) and secondly for absorption coefficient at 8 wavelengths between 0.5 and 1 &mu;m using the Integrating Sandwich technique ( Clarke 1982 &semi; Foot and Kilsby 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #57:1>
( c ) Satellite data
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #58:1>
NOAA-9 ( AVHRR ) data from a pass overhead the United Kingdom at 1346 GMT on 12 September 1988 have been used for two purposes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #59:1>
Firstly the imagery from the near infrared channel 3 ( 3.7 &mu;m ) shows the distribution and extent of straw-burning over England ( Fig. 2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #60:1>
Channel 3 is very sensitive to the presence of small hot spots in the field of view due to the non-linearity of the Planck function ( Saunders 1986 ) and has been proposed as a means of monitoring straw-burning ( Muirhead and Cracknell 1985 ) , and used to monitor tropical deforestation in South America ( Malingreau et al. 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #61:1>
Radiances from the visible channel 1 ( 0.63 &mu;m ) and infrared channel 2 ( 0.86 &mu;m ) are also used quantitatively to derive aerosol optical depths .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #62:1>
The technique is described in detail in section 3 ( b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #63:1>
3 . AEROSOL PROPERTIES
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #64:1>
( a ) Aircraft measurements
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #65:1>
The vertical distribution of aerosol is best shown by the total number concentration ( 0.25 &less-than;r&less-than;3.75 &mu;m ) measured with the FSSP ( Fig. 4 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #66:1>
This shows some aerosol situated below a temperature inversion at 900 m , but the majority is concentrated below a lower inversion at 90 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #67:1>
No significant amounts of aerosol were observed above 900 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #68:1>
The vertical distribution of aerosol scattering coefficient , measured with the inte<l>grating nephelometer during aircraft profiles and level runs , is shown in Fig. 5 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #69:1>
This corresponds very well with the FSSP measurements , but there is some discrepancy between the profile measurements , taken during a 2.5 ms<sp>-1 ms-1 descent , and the level runs which were performed in an ascending staircase .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #70:1>
This could be due to time lags in the instrument sampling and in flushing the sample volume of the instrument , especially after filling with the very polluted air of the lowest run of the ascent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #71:1>
The best estimate of scattering coefficient is considered to be between these measurements , although an underestimate may occur near the surface in the very high concentrations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #72:1>
The size distribution by volume measured by the FSSP averaged over 12 minutes in the dense haze is shown in Fig. 6 , and displays a dip at 0.9 &mu;m radius mm radius characteristic of previous FSSP measurements in a variety of conditions ( Kilsby and Smith 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #73:1>
This dip is believed to be instrumental in origin .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #74:1>
The instrument is incapable of detecting the very small ( r &smaller-than; 0.2&mu; m ) smoke particles expected from straw-burning , and high concentrations of large particles suggest that at a distance of 200-300 km from the source , some coagulation may have occurred .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #75:1>
A number of filter samples were collected on the 2 days of the experiment &semi; three off the north east coast on 11 September at 60 and 300 m , and one on 12 September between 60 and 300 m over a 25-minute period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #76:1>
The results of gravimetric and optical absorption analysis of these filters are given in Table 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #77:1>
A spectral plot of absorption coefficient ( &BETA; abs ) is given in Fig. 7 for the 12 September filter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #78:1>
This displays the inverse wavelength dependence characteristic of a grey absorber such as elemental carbon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #79:1>
Combination with mass loading measurements allows the specific absorption and effective imaginary refractive index ( n 2 ) to be calculated ( Gerber 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #80:1>
The specific absorption ( &Beta;[<sb>]a[</sb>] ) of &approximate-sign; 2.2 m 2 g -1 is very high for normal atmospheric aerosols but is in line with accepted values for products of flaming combustion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #81:1>
Values in the literature range from 0.7 to 2.4 m 2 g -1 for burning pine needles ( Patterson et al. 1986 ) , through 2.0 m 2 g -1 for assumed nuclear winter smoke ( NRC 1985 ) to 10-12 m 2 g -1 for carbon soots .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #82:1>
The single-scattering albedos ( &omega;<sb>0</sb> ) at 0.55 &mu;m have been calculated using the measured absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient , measured at 0.48 &mu;m scaled to 0.55 &mu;m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #83:1>
The scaling factor of 1.16 was calculated from the wavelength dependence of the Standard Radiation Atmosphere ( SRA ) continental aerosol model ( WMO 1986 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #84:1>
The value of 0.92 ( &plus-or-minus; 0.02 ) for 12 September is higher than those for 11 September but if a scattering coefficient for the profile is used rather than one for the level runs , a value of 0.90 is obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #85:1>
The relation between n 2 and &omega;0 is easily tested if assumptions of size distribution and n 1 ( real part of the refractive index ) are made .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #86:1>
This is best illustrated by Fig. 8 , in which the solid line is a mean relationship between n 2 and &omega;<sb>0</sb> &omega;0 calculated with Mie theory for a large number of observed size distributions with a refractive index , n 1 , of 1.5 ( Gerber 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #87:1>
The line is a good approximation to a number of measurements , and the straw-burning values are not exceptional .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #88:1>
This comparison gives confidence in the three separate constituent measurements &semi; absorption coefficient , mass loading and scattering coefficient .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #89:1>
Estimates of the total aerosol extinction optical depth on 12 September at 0.48 &mu;m may be made using the nephelometer data shown in Fig. 5 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #90:1>
The best estimate is 0.25 &plus-or-minus; 0.04 assuming a single scattering albedo of 0.92 , but this technique assumes horizontal homogeneity of aerosol concentration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #91:1>
A comparison with other estimates using different methods may be made using Fig. 10 , and this vertical integration of the scattering coefficient appears somewhat low .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #92:1>
( b ) Satellite measurements
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #93:1>
The derivation of aerosol optical depth , and its spatial distribution over the ocean from satellites is a well established technique ( Griggs 1984 &semi; Durkee et al. 1986 &semi; Masuda et al. 1988 ) , though not without difficulty .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #94:1>
In principle any visible or near infrared satellite channel may be utilised , and AVHRR channels 1 and 2 have been used here .
<ICE-GB:W2A-029 #95:1>
AVHRR data are readily available and these channels give a useful compromise in spectral and spatial resolution , as well as being situated at nearly ideal wavelengths ( 0.58-0.68 and 0.72-1.1 &mu;m ) for accuracy of retrieval .

<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #1:1>
Major pollution incidents
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #2:1>
Major accidents and pollution incidents , which thankfully are rare , often create very special trans-frontier pollution problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #3:1>
For example , a massive spill of dyes , insecticides and mercury from a chemical warehouse in Basel , Switzerland , on the 1st November 1986 , killed most of the fish in the Rhine downstream &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #4:1>
innocent ( third party ) countries suffered from upstream pollution ( World Resources , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #5:1>
Perhaps the most graphic illustration of a major environmental accident with serious trans<l>frontier consequences was the spread of radiation through the atmosphere from the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the western Soviet Union in April 1986 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #6:1>
The incident is well documented elsewhere ( Park , 1989a and 1989b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #7:1>
The accident , caused by human error and negligence , is on record as &ldquo; the world 's worst nuclear accident &rdquo; ... yet !
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #8:1>
One of the four nuclear reactors at the plant was badly damaged by a chemical explosion after it seriously over-heated and went out of control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #9:1>
Highly radioactive ( and dangerous ) fission products poured out uncontrollably into the atmosphere for a period of ten days , while the struggle was under way to plug the leak .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #10:1>
This material created an invisible radiation cloud which blew over much of Western Europe within days , and many areas were contaminated by dry fallout ( of particles and dust ) and when rain washed material back to the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #11:1>
The radiation cloud cast a long shadow over Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #12:1>
Reactions to the health threat differed from country to country , as the cloud drifted first northwards over Scandinavia and later southwards across Europe and Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #13:1>
Many countries banned the import of foodstuffs ( fruit , vegetables , milk , fresh meat , animals for slaughter , game and freshwater fish ) from countries within 1,000 km of Chernobyl to reduce health risks to humans .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #14:1>
Some ( like Britain ) banned the sale of milk and dairy products from sheep and cattle which grazed fresh ( contaminated ) grass .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #15:1>
Anxiety was heightened throughout Europe during the first week of May , but only in Poland was the radiation threat regarded as serious enough to issue stable iodine tablets and solutions as a prophylactic ( preventive medicine ) to an estimated 10 million children and youths .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #16:1>
The direct costs of Chernobyl include over 1,000 immediate injuries , 31 immediate deaths and the evacuation of 135,000 people from towns and villages around the reactor complex .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #17:1>
Recent Soviet estimates put the total cost ( including clean-up operations , damaged farmland and lost productivity ) at around $358 billion ( Toufexis 1990 , p. 30 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #18:1>
In the order of 100 million people throughout Europe and the Western Soviet Union received some exposure to low levels of radiation ( especially to iodine-131 and caesium-137 ) from Chernobyl .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #19:1>
The whole world is believed to have received a radiation dose equivalent to all previous nuclear weapons ' fallout , and some individual doses in Britain were equivalent to one year of natural background radiation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #20:1>
Damage has been worst in the area around Chernobyl , where there has been a dramatic rise in the incidence of thyroid diseases , anaemia , cancer and symptoms of radiation sickness ( including fatigue , loss of vision and appetite ) amongst humans , and some grotesque birth defects amongst livestock .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #21:1>
There are many different estimates of the likely long-term human cost of the accident .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #22:1>
One pessimistic estimate is that radiation from the accident weakened the immune systems and caused the premature deaths of between 35,000-40,000 people in the USA alone during the summer after the explosion ( Caufield 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #23:1>
Other estimates of the world-wide number of deaths from radiation-induced cancers likely to be caused by Chernobyl up to the year 2030 vary between 1,000 and 500,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #24:1>
Global problems
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #25:1>
Global problems are truly world-wide and affect ( directly or indirectly ) most , if not all , individual countries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #26:1>
The two most important global pollution problems today are ozone depletion and greenhouse gases , both of which illustrate the need for global co-operation to tackle a major problem before it is even fully understood or documented .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #27:1>
Here we consider the case of ozone depletion in more detail .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #28:1>
The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere , which surrounds the whole earth , is a shared resource .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #29:1>
This natural filter prevents excessive amounts of harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun from reaching the earth 's surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #30:1>
If it is damaged ( by thinning or by puncture ) , more UV radiation would pass straight through the atmosphere &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #31:1>
this would have a variety of possible impacts ( depending on the extent and location of the damage ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #32:1>
Agricultural crops would be scorched , and yields would fall &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #33:1>
marine plankton would be seriously affected &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #34:1>
human health would suffer ( there would be more eye cataracts , more skin cancer , more problems arising from damage to people 's body immune systems ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #35:1>
The problems are likely to affect a great many countries , if not the whole surface of the earth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #36:1>
Interest in possible damage to the ozone layer was first raised in the early 1970s , when atmospheric chemists expressed concern over the possible damaging effects of CFCs ( chlorofluorocarbons ) in the atmosphere ( phase 1 of the issue-attention cycle ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #37:1>
The USA , Canada and Sweden took the issue seriously and unilaterally introduced bans on the use of CFC-propelled aerosols ( phase 2 for those countries , still phase 1 for other countries ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #38:1>
These countries also sought major international co-operation on the ozone problem , and a 1977 United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) conference set goals for further research and consultation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #39:1>
This initial round of interest in the problem accounts for the 1970s wave of media coverage in ozone depletion ( Fig. 2b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #40:1>
Most countries refused to recognize ozone depletion as a serious problem until British scientists discovered a seasonal hole , the size of the USA , in the ozone layer over the Antarctic in 1985 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #41:1>
Their field monitoring detected a 40 per cent thinning in the ozone layer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #42:1>
Their evidence suggested that the hole was growing bigger through time , and satellite surveillance confirmed the initial reports .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #43:1>
The main cause of the thinning was believed to be a 3-fold increase in atmospheric CFCs within 10 years .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #44:1>
Suddenly the issue of ozone depletion was taken seriously &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #45:1>
it moved to phase 2 in the issue-<l>attention cycle in most countries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #46:1>
The 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer , which sought to minimize human destruction of the ozone layer ( mainly by reducing CFC production ) was initially signed by 22 countries , but not all countries agreed about the urgency of the problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #47:1>
Three camps emerged :
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #48:1>
the so-called Toronto group ( which included the USA , Canada , Sweden , Finland and Norway ) agreed to ban or restrict the use of CFC-propelled aerosols &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #49:1>
the European Community countries agreed on a reduction in the use of CFCs but took little action &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #50:1>
Japan and the USSR decided to wait for further scientific evidence .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #51:1>
In 1987 39 nations signed the Montreal Protocol , under which they agreed to freeze CFC production at 1986 levels , and to decrease production by 20 per cent by 1993 and by half by 1999 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #52:1>
On 5th March 1989 London hosted a major international conference on the ozone layer in London , at which more nations signed the Montreal Protocol .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #53:1>
As World Resources Institute ( 1987 , p. 195 ) point out , the Vienna Convention was unique and important because &ldquo; it attempted to avert an environmental problem before adverse effects were apparent &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #54:1>
Acid rain
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #55:1>
One of the most widespread multi-national trans-frontier pollution problems over the last decade has been acid rain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #56:1>
It provides an interesting contrast to the sudden problems posed by the fallout of radiation after the Chernobyl accident , because acid rain represents an incremental problem which builds up slowly through time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #57:1>
Only when critical environmental thresholds are crossed do signs appear of biological damage , especially to trees , lakes and rivers ( Park , 1987 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #58:1>
Today it is considered to be one of the most serious environmental problems facing developed countries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #59:1>
Damage to forests , lakes and buildings has been reported downwind from most industrial areas of the world , but the worst damage to date appears to be in Scandinavia , parts of Western Europe , and eastern Canada and the United States .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #60:1>
Chemistry and geography
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #61:1>
Normal rain has a pH of 5.6 or greater .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #62:1>
This is more acidic than distilled water ( which has a pH of 7 ) because even unpolluted rain is contaminated with natural products of volcanic eruptions , forest fires , and sea spray from the oceans .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #63:1>
Precipitation with a pH of below 5.6 is described as acidic , or acidified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #64:1>
The lower the pH value , the greater the acidification ( recall that the pH scale is logarithmic , so pH 5 is ten times as acidic as pH 6 , pH 4 is 100 times as acidic , and so on ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #65:1>
The figures can be deceptive , because small changes in pH represent major changes in levels of acidity and thus potential damage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #66:1>
Acid rain is created by the transformation within the atmosphere of gaseous pollutants , principally sulphur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( NO x ) which are emitted mainly ( but not exclusively ) from coal-fired power stations and vehicle exhausts respectively .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #67:1>
These oxides interact with sunlight and other atmospheric contaminants such as ozone , photo-oxidants , hydrocarbons and moisture &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #68:1>
the chain-reaction turns the primary pollutants into a variable cocktail of secondary pollutants .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #69:1>
The term &lsquo; acid rain &rsquo; is a short-hand version of acid deposition - the fallout of acidic material from the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #70:1>
It can occur in dry and wet forms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #71:1>
Dry deposition involves the fallout of gases , aerosols and fine particles , usually relatively close to emission sources of the gases .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #72:1>
Wet deposition comes with precipitation ( mainly in rain , but also in snow , mist , hail and so on ) , and it mostly occurs further downwind , after the complex chemical transformations have taken place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #73:1>
The oxides can remain active for at least seven days , during which time they can be blown thousands of kms by wind systems and the materials washed out after dissolution in the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #74:1>
There is often a distinct geographical zonation of dry and wet deposition downwind from a source of the gaseous oxides , with a local &lsquo; ring of confidence &rsquo; closest to the source , followed by a zone of dry fallout and then a much wider zone of wet deposition ( Fig. 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #75:1>
Both wet and dry forms of acid deposition have been associated with environmental damage , but it is the wet deposition which has figured so prominently in the recent &lsquo; acid rain debate &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #76:1>
This is because it can travel vast distances .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #77:1>
Measurements show that wind-blow of between 1,000 and 2,000 km within five days is not unusual ( Goldsmith &ampersand; Hildyard , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #78:1>
The ability to travel so far and so easily creates the trans-frontier pollution problem &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #79:1>
pollution and damage are exported from donor countries to innocent downwind third parties .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #80:1>
Thus , it has been argued , much of the sulphur dioxide emitted from chimneys and power stations in the UK , France and West Germany is eventually deposited over Scandinavia , causing great damage to freshwater lakes and rivers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #81:1>
Swedish scientists estimate that up to nine tenths of the sulphur deposited on Sweden is blown in from abroad .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #82:1>
The USA is also accused of exporting acid rain from industrial centres in the north-<l>east ( especially the Ohio Valley ) , across the Canadian border into the province of Ontario .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #83:1>
Despite notable advances over the last two decades , monitoring of rainfall chemistry is still rather patchy and reliable data are not available from all parts of the earth 's surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #84:1>
But the available evidence reveals two key &lsquo; hot spot &rsquo; areas where acid rain is particularly problematic ( Fig. 4 ) the north-east of North America ( straddling northeast USA and eastern Canada ) , and much of Western Europe ( including Scandinavia and Britain ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #85:1>
Many parts of the heavily industrialised areas of Eastern Europe ( in Poland and Czechoslovakia in particular ) are also believed to be badly affected by acidification , but detailed studies are not yet available in the west ( Booth et al , 1990 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #86:1>
The evidence from rainfall monitoring through time ( in particular since the early 1970s ) reveals that these problem areas are in fact getting worse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #87:1>
Precipitation pH within the hot-spots is falling ( levels of acidity are increasing ) , and the geographical areas receiving acid rain are getting bigger .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #88:1>
New hot-spots are starting to emerge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #89:1>
For example , parts of west coast USA are now showing signs of serious acidification .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #90:1>
History
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #91:1>
The acid rain controversy is very much a product of the 1980s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #92:1>
Interest in the problem , certainly outside Scandinavia , was extremely limited before about 1982 ( Fig. 2c ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #93:1>
Yet the problem itself is not entirely new .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #94:1>
Since the start of the Industrial Revolution air pollution has been creating biological deserts around industrial centres , and Robert Smith ( Britain 's first air pollution inspector ) discovered links between sooty skies and acid fallout around industrial Manchester in 1852 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #95:1>
Wholesale fish deaths , declining fish populations and falling rates of reproduction in many freshwater lakes in southern Scandinavia from the 1920s onwards were linked with acidification .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #96:1>
But wider scientific interest in the problem was not awakened until detailed studies by Svente Oden in the late 1960s ( summarised in Oden , 1976 ) revealed the possible link with air pollution , particularly that blown in from overseas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #97:1>
However , Oden 's studies received little international recognition in the early 1970s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #98:1>
The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment , in Stockholm , brought together scientists and representatives from most countries , who discussed a range of pollution issues .
<ICE-GB:W2A-030 #99:1>
Sweden pressed hard for sulphur pollution and acid rain to be discussed , but no other country saw the issue as important enough to include it on the agenda .

1 . INTRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #10:1>
Betws Colliery commenced production operations in the South Wales anthracite field in 1978 after a four-year mine develop<l>ment period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #11:1>
Between 1980-1983 the average annual output of 570000 saleable tonnes was produced at an overall productivity level of approximately 4.5 t per manshift .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #12:1>
The resulting profitability was considered to justify the technological investment made in the high quality but limited area reserves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #13:1>
The original mine layout ( Barfoot , 1977 ) envisaged the extraction of Red Vein reserves primarily in the south west section , providing a 12-15 year life .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #14:1>
However , successful extraction techniques in the early years ( Isaac , Smart , Roberts , 1982 ) gener<l>ated higher production levels than were forecast , effectively reducing mine life .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #15:1>
In order to maintain a longer-term supply of prime anthracite to the smokeless fuel market , expansion of the mine layout was planned into the eastern area of Four Feet Seam reserves .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #16:1>
To achieve production targets and devel<l>opment activity required a 220 m deep , three metre diameter intake shaft , and a 600 m long , 4.9 m diameter arched drift return airway driven on a gradient of 1 in 3.5 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #17:1>
The decision to employ a shaft/drift combination was made in the interest of overall economy , and , in view of the application of shaft drilling techniques , for technological devel<l>opment ( Richardson and Thomas , 1983 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #18:1>
The contract for shaft construction by blind hole drilling for the first time in the UK coal industry , was awarded to the Thyssen ( GB ) Ltd/Piggott Shaft Drilling Consortium .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #19:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #20:1>
VENTILATION PLANNING
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #21:1>
At the beginning of the Betws project , it was realised that the restriction of two long main drifts would limit the air quantity to a maximum of 125 m3/s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #22:1>
A higher quantity would have incurred intolerably high air velocities and excessive absorption of venti<l>lation pressure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #23:1>
With the general level of output higher than originally planned , the surface fans required uprating to their maximum duty early in the life of the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #24:1>
Even then , during high production periods , the methane percentage in the air approached statutory limits and production was curtailed to allow dilution to take place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #25:1>
Experience in the Red Vein at Betws Colliery , where no other workable seam lay in close proximity , indicated that gas emis<l>sion was consistent at 15 m<sp>3</sp>/t m3/t , being influ<l>enced mainly by rate of extraction and depth from the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #26:1>
The Four Feet Seam in the area had seams nearby with a number of rider seams both above and below the proposed working horizon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #27:1>
No experience existed of working the seam in a virgin area , although the Four Feet Seam had been worked at nearby Ammanford Colliery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #28:1>
Where handgot long<l->wall faces had been underworked in another seam some nine metres below , gas emission was considerably reduced and methane drainage was successfully practised from boreholes above the goaf .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #29:1>
Gas emission at approximately 15-20 m<sp>3</sp>/t m3/t from the reserves in the eastern section was expected to be greater in total than that normally experienced in the Red Vein because of the proximity of other coal seams .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #30:1>
Hence , more air would be required for each face , and larger bulk quantities needed for each district for simultaneous high speed development programmes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #31:1>
The future success of Betws Colliery was considered to depend on its ability to provide increased bulk air quantity for the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #32:1>
Achievement of the extra volume was the subject of considerable planning , with initial attention being given to possible modifi<l>cations to the existing layout .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #33:1>
These included : ( i ) two new cross measure drifts from the mine surface to the North district roadways &semi; ( ii ) two shafts from the surface to the existing North district roadways , the shafts being located away from the present mine surface &semi; ( iii ) a combination of shaft and drift to the North section of the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #34:1>
Mine planning decisions are usually a compromise between competing requirements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #35:1>
The proposal of a drift/shaft combination offered advantages with regard to low profile buildings and lower construc<l>tion costs in the case of the drift , and reduced ventilation costs in the case of the shafts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #36:1>
Although the reduction in ventilation cost was not significant , the possibility of obtain<l>ing experience with a new technique of shaft sinking was considered an attractive option .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #37:1>
After consideration of the various propo<l>sals and attendant costs , it was agreed that the most significant advantages would derive from one return surface drift equipped with a multi-fan system , and one intake drilled shaft ( see Fig. 1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #38:1>
The drift would allow for an economic fan installation , eliminate surface civil engineering works , and limit major environmental impact .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #39:1>
An intake shaft would provide higher ventilation effi<l>ciency for the more extensive layout planned for the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #40:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #41:1>
BLIND SHAFT DRILLING PRACTICE
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #42:1>
3.1
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #43:1>
Development
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #44:1>
The drilling of blind holes for mine shafts originated in Europe around 1850 in the mining industries of the Netherlands and Germany , where the poor strata conditions associated with weak water-bearing for<l>mations encouraged development of safer techniques of shaft construction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #45:1>
From 1900 to 1960 , over 30 large diameter mine shafts were drilled for ventilation , access and winding in German and Dutch coalmines .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #46:1>
Diameters of up to eight metres were drilled to depths of almost 500 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #47:1>
Shaft drilling practice initially employed cable-tool or churn drilling techniques which restricted shaft diameters and penetration rates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #48:1>
As a result , rotary drilling techniques were introduced and from 1936 to 1955 , several large diameter mine shafts were bored by a coring method ( the calyx system ) which enabled large diameter holes to be economically bored in hard rock to relatively shallow depths .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #49:1>
The adaptation of oil well techniques to the technique of blind hole drilling produced dramatic improvements in the development of drilled shaft construction ( Cobbs , 1979 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #50:1>
The earliest method of &lsquo; big hole &rsquo; drilling was performed with multiple passes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #51:1>
A pilot hole of approximately 0.3 m diameter , was enlarged to an intermediate diameter of say one metre , and successively enlarged to the final diameter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #52:1>
In most instances , drilling was accomplished with two passes of the cutting head , although in some cases four passes were required to reach final diameter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #53:1>
The serious development of rotary blind shaft drilling occurred in the Nevada Desert , USA , where the US Atomic Energy Com<l>mission used the technique in the construc<l>tion of large diameter shafts with full face cutting heads .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #54:1>
At this site , two or three rigs drilled continuously to depths of 600-700 m at diameters of two to three metres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #55:1>
Similar dimension holes have been drilled in the Pittsburgh Coal Measure districts , primarily for ventilation purposes , and often when they ceased to be required , such holes were backfilled .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #56:1>
3.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #57:1>
UK Practice
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #58:1>
Blind shaft drilling in the UK was performed initially by the Piggott Drilling Company and subsequently by the Thyssen/Piggott Consortium ( Piggott and King , 1985 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #59:1>
Prior to commissioning by British Coal for the Betws shaft project , the Piggott Drilling Company had completed four holes and the Thyssen/Piggott Consortium had drilled six .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #60:1>
The first of the above shafts was an inspection shaft , of one metre in diameter to a depth of 50 m , for the North West Water Authority .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #61:1>
Subsequently , three effluent treatment shafts were drilled at : 1.37 m diameter , 50 m deep - ICI Billingham &semi; 2.44 m diameter , 110 m deep - ICI Wilton &semi; 2.44 m diameter , 180 m deep - Anglia Water Authority .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #62:1>
The two ventilation shafts at Brightling for British Gypsum were drilled at 2.44 m diameter , one to a depth of 76 m , and the other to 210 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #63:1>
The four drilled shafts at South Kill<l>ingholme were constructed for the access of men , equipment and materials into caverns , the shafts being drilled at 2.44 m diameter to a depth of between 180-215 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #64:1>
The decision by British Coal to contract the work to specialist drilling engineers was based on the experience gained by the companies during the preceding five-year period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #65:1>
It apeared appeared that the advantages to be derived from blind shaft drilling more than justified the technological investment in the work .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #66:1>
It was claimed that blind shaft drilling offered rapid access with increased safety , compared with conventional methods , for the same diameter shaft .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #67:1>
Poor ground conditions or high water inflows could also be accommodated by manipulation of the drill fluid which exerted a positive pressure on the aquifer or unstable zone , thus preventing inflows into the shaft .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #68:1>
The technique also eliminated the discomfort and adverse effects of heat , humidity and water , suffered during conventional shaft sinking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #69:1>
An important potential advantage was that of rapid access to selected locations in the reserves , thus enabling development activities to proceed simultaneously with construction of the primary entries to the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #70:1>
This would result in an overall reduction in development time and lead to earlier coal production .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #71:1>

THE BETWS SHAFT PROJECT , 1985-86
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #73:1>
4.1
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #74:1>
Project Schedule
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #75:1>
A summary of the various operations involved in shaft construction is given in Table 1 , which shows an anticipated project schedule extending for 34 weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #76:1>
Site prepar<l>ation and 20 m of foreshaft construction were considered to proceed simultaneously and require almost ten weeks of the schedule .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #77:1>
Thereafter , shaft drilling would extend from 20-215 m below the surface and take some nine weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #78:1>
The final 13 weeks of the programme were planned to encompass shaft lining and grouting , dewatering opera<l>tions , and connection to the underground workings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #79:1>
4.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #80:1>
Technical Considerations
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #81:1>
In order to achieve a finished diameter of three metres , the shaft was required to be drilled with a 3.75 m diameter bit using tungsten carbide-tipped cutting discs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #82:1>
Inter<l>section with the Red Vein was to occur at a depth of 215 m , with drilling to cease at approximately 220 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #83:1>
At more than 30 m in height , the drill rig was mounted on a steel frame sub-structure of approximately six metres height .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #84:1>
The sub-structure allowed a clear opening of 7.3 m width to permit handling of the large diameter cutting head .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #85:1>
Previous shaft drilling operations had used cutting heads up to 2.44 m in diameter .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #86:1>
The driving gear to rotate the 3.75 m diameter head was an adapted crane drive ring of 2.49 m diameter , hence the need for the sub-structure to accommodate the larger bit .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #87:1>
Power on site was self-contained using six 250 kVA capacity diesel generators .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #88:1>
Six 200 hp electric motors each serviced a Sundstrand hydraulic pump .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #89:1>
Three of the hydraulic pumps drove three Staffa motors , each capable of 170 hp , which in turn powered the rotary table through 3:1 reduc<l>tion gears .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #90:1>
The other three Sundstrand pumps supplied oil to two motors which powered the draw works winch .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #91:1>
The winch , which raised and lowered the drill bit with a single pull capacity of 36 t , operated through a crown block and a 12 fall travelling block with a total hook load capacity of 360 t .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #92:1>
To reach the planned depth with 34 drill pipes , each six metres long , of 304 mm internal diameter and weighing 1.5 t , required a torque output from the rig of 160000 Nm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #93:1>
The Toyo circulating pump was six metres in length and weighed nine tonnes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #94:1>
The bottom hole assembly consisted of a 70 t cutting head , three 27 t weights , and a 37 t non<l->rotating stabiliser fitted with six large spring pads that pressed against the wall of the shaft .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #95:1>
The bottom hole assembly was 13.5 m in length and weighed approximately 185 t , this being related to winch capacity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #96:1>
4.3
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #97:1>
Preliminary Operations
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #98:1>
Site clearance and levelling operations commenced on 12 August , 1985 , on a moderately steep hillside environment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #99:1>
The boundary fence , which had dimensions of 130 m x 65 m , emphasised the compact nature of the site which lay 1.5 km due south of Betws Colliery .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #100:1>
To house the bottom hole assembly before drilling commenced , a foreshaft of 20.5 m depth was constructed using conventional drill/blast methods .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #101:1>
A foreshaft collar with mudflow inset was placed after debris removal by hydraulic excavators .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #102:1>
Tempo<l>rary support of the excavated ground was by circular steel , two-piece rings , meshed and bolted to the sides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #103:1>
Each successive ring was suspended by steel plates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #104:1>
At approximately 18 m depth , a crib was excavated from the foreshaft walls into which was placed steel reinforcement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #105:1>
The crib was intended to provide additional foundation support for the drill rig .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #106:1>
At 20.5 m depth , a 500 mm thick , perfectly level concrete base was laid and at the same time the crib was filled with concrete .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #107:1>
The base was provided for the cutting head to commence operations in its correct position .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #108:1>
At this point , cast iron tubbing was raised back to the surface in 2.4 m intervals , with concrete placed in the annulus between the tubbings and shaft walls .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #109:1>
Foreshaft construction to 20 m depth took 34 days to complete on single-shift operations , with completion , as scheduled , in week nine of the project .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #110:1>
During this period , and particularly for shotfiring opera<l>tions , neighbouring properties were moni<l>tored for noise and vibration levels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #111:1>
Permit-<l>ted Permitted levels in each case were 110 dB pressure and 0.5 mm/s vibration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #112:1>
After foreshaft completion , the scaffolding was removed and the shaft allowed to fill with water .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #113:1>
During foreshaft construction , a concrete base was laid at the surface for the rig and cutting head transporter , which required approximately 170 m3 of concrete .
<ICE-GB:W2A-031 #114:1>
As a safety precaution , a heavy duty shaft cover was placed over the top of the shaft , allowing installation of the rig on 10 October 1985 , ie week ten into the project .

Introduction

Interest in artificial neural nets ( ANNs ) has been building for several years in many countries around the world .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #10:1>
Recent conferences , e.g. Washington ( 1989 ) , on ANNs have had several thousand attendees , and a society - The International Neural Network Society - and several new journals , eg , &lsquo; Neural Networks &rsquo; and &lsquo; Connection Science &rsquo; , devoted exclusively to the study of ANNs have come into existence in the last two years .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #11:1>
The underlying motivation for the study of ANNs is the consciousness that the brain , both human and animal , seems capable of easily performing many tasks which are either difficult , or impossible , for conventional serial computers ( Von Neumann machines ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #12:1>
Examples include the recognition and understanding of speech , the interpretation of natural scenes , and sophisticated methods of control which allow animals ubiquitous movement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #13:1>
The very great differences between the mechanisms of processing in the brain and those of a Von Neumann computer are well known .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #14:1>
The Von Neumann computer - shown in simple block form in Fig 1a - possesses a central processor attached to a memory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #15:1>
Instructions and data are fed sequentially from the memory into the processor and a program of calculations - including sequence jumps based on logical decisions - is run .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #16:1>
The very high speed at which the calculations are now possible enables such machines to perform tasks which are far beyond the capabilities of a human being .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #17:1>
For example , a digitised image which may contain several million bits of information can be transformed into the frequency domain in a fraction of a second .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #18:1>
The brain , on the other hand , consists of a very large number of neurons , each of which operates relatively slowly - five orders of magnitude more slowly than can a silicon switch ( Fig 1b ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #19:1>
These neurons are connected together via axons and synapses , and the latter , by varying their influence upon the transmission of signals to the neuron , enable learning to take place .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #20:1>
Brains may thus learn to perform many tasks without any program of instructions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #21:1>
A child learns to understand speech by constant repetition of words in appropriate situations &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #22:1>
he or she has no mechanism by which semantics and syntax could be taught as a sequence of instructions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #23:1>
Yet no computer can be programmed to match the performance , even of a four-year-old , in this sphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #24:1>
As the nature and function of the brain has become better understood , the power of conventional computers has similarly increased to the point where simulations of highly interconnected brain-like systems have become possible and inevitable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #25:1>
In addition , the emergence of new techniques of implementation of the high connectivities seen in brains , ( e.g. wafer-scale integration , optical computing and amorphous silicon ) have spurred interest in the study of brain-like architectures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #26:1>
Figure 2 shows a comparison between an artificial neuron and a simplified diagram of a real neuron .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #27:1>
The artificial neuron usually takes the form of a processing element with a large number of inputs which are summed to produce an excitation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #28:1>
The single output is then produced by applying a nonlinear activation function to the excitation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #29:1>
The activation function often has a monotonic form such that for low values of excitation the output is virtually zero - and for high values it takes a more or less fixed value ( Fig 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #30:1>
It can then be viewed as a device which has an on state , an off state , and a transition zone .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #31:1>
Large numbers of these artificial neurons can then be connected together in various clusters and layers to form nets .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #32:1>
The connections between them are given weights , which behave like the synapses of the brain and transmit greater to lesser proportions of the signals they carry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #33:1>
Although the possibility of simulating or building systems to operate in a brain-like manner has greatly increased , this would not in itself justify the huge explosion in research into artificial neural nets which is seen today .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #34:1>
There are other reasons which stimulate research in this area .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #35:1>
Several of the tasks that brains can perform well have strong commercial potential -
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #36:1>
for example , automatic speech recognition and synthesis are already used in many applications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #37:1>
Computer language translation is another area where large applications exist .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #38:1>
Several aspects of network management - routeing and fault-finding for example - can be addressed by neural networks , perhaps as adjuncts to conventional expert systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #39:1>
In addition , the dramatic and expensive growth of software engineering threatens to set an upper limit on the feasibility of very complex systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #40:1>
The possibility of training systems by the automated presentation of training regimes is a very attractive one for commercial organisations who spend as much as ninety percent of system design budgets on software .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #41:1>
In visual applications , which are the main subject of this paper , several important applications exist .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #42:1>
Scene interpretation can be used with telecommunications to allow intelligent surveillance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #43:1>
In addition , large telecommunications companies often have sizeable collections of plans of line plant which have been produced manually by draftsmen in the past .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #44:1>
It may be desired to store all this information in a computerised database , but the cost of converting the data by hand can be prohibitive in view of the quantity involved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #45:1>
In such a case , a system which can recognise the features of such charts - lines and labelling characters - could be used to aid in the conversion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #46:1>
Even a ten percent saving on estimated costs of manual conversion can show savings of the order of tens of millions of pounds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #47:1>
Facial feature extraction has a number of possible applications in telecommunications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #48:1>
Automatic facial identification has obvious application in police and security work but in addition there are also applications for facial feature extraction in low-bit rate visual telecommunication .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #49:1>
If an accurate model of a human head in three dimensions can be stored in a receiver , and its motions and small distortions involved in speech and expressions identified at the transmitter , then only a relatively small amount of data needs to be transmitted for a typical videophone scene .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #50:1>
For such a system to be successful , accurate mapping of a generic head model onto an actual head is required , as is the tracking of variable features such as eyes and mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #51:1>
ANNs have many applications in this area of facial feature extraction and tracking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #52:1>

Principles and approaches
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #54:1>
2.1
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #55:1>
The relationship between neural architecture and the learning function
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #56:1>
Neural nets are often thought of as architectures for constructing new forms of computing machinery , but this view sometimes obscures the true nature of the research in the field .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #57:1>
The functional feature of the brain , which seems to enable it to solve the problems at which it excels , comes from its learning ability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #58:1>
Whether it is an immediate problem of control , as in the human ability to walk upright , or in a higher function such as interpreting the characters on a page , a task is learned over a period of time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #59:1>
If this learning ability could be emulated , whether by an ordinary Von Neumann machine , or by some elaborate new technology , the result would be the achievement of the aim .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #60:1>
Of course , in searching for the method of reproducing the brain 's learning function the brain has been seen as a useful model , and it is not surprising that the most successful systems behave like interconnections of neuron-like processors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #61:1>
Such a system can be operated on a conventional computer , and the same functionality attained as would be the case if some special hardware were built &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #62:1>
it is only with the aim of achieving the same speed as the brain that new methods of implementation are sought .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #63:1>
Much of the contemporary work on neural nets can therefore be seen as work on learning algorithms , which are not primarily concerned with the physical realisation of the highly interconnected sets of processors which they postulate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #64:1>
The evaluation of the algorithms requires very fast processing , and this has led to many developments of special hardware for the study of neural nets , but few if any of the nets actually realise the high interconnectivity physically .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #65:1>
The following study largely restricts itself to the study of neural algorithms and the results obtained by simulating such algorithms when applied to tasks for which they are seen as appropriate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #66:1>
Discussions of various methods and technologies by which these and other algorithms might best be implemented are detailed elsewhere

2.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #69:1>
Neural net architectures
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #70:1>
The possibilities for assembling neural processors into nets , and devising learning stratagems are very numerous , and a large number have been described .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #71:1>
Such combinations of architectures and algorithms have been dubbed neural net paradigms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #72:1>
It is intended here , after describing an early paradigm , to concentrate on two , both of which have been studied by the authors and their colleagues , and which in any case act as representatives for the two most important classes of ANN - the supervised net and the unsupervised net .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #73:1>
They are the Kohonen net , which is an example of the unsupervised learning method , and the multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) , which is a good example of a supervised net .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #74:1>
The MLP grew out of an earlier idea , the perceptron [ 2 ] , a single layer linear threshold net ( see Fig 2 ) , which was described and studied in various pattern recognition tasks and whose capabilities were grossly overestimated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #75:1>
Rosenblatt , F :

&lsquo; Principles of neurodynamics &rsquo; , Spartan , New York , ( 1962 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #77:1>
The single layer net can be seen as a crude emulation of a neural cell , or neuron , in the brain .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #78:1>
Figure 2 shows a comparison between a single layer , single output net and a simplified neuron .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #79:1>
The single layer net forms its output according to the following equations :
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #80:1>
The method by which the perceptron was able to learn to classify input patterns into two classes , for example , was an algorithm for altering the weights of the connections w1 , w2 , .... , wn during a training phase in such a way that the network eventually gave a correct output in response to the patterns on which it is trained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #81:1>
The training process consists of inputting the desired patterns in sequence , and using the delta ( or Widrow-Hoff ) rule to alter the connection weights : .... ( 2 ) where &mu; is the learning rate and t is the desired output .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #82:1>
It may easily be verified that such a single layer net can learn to perform certain tasks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #83:1>
For example , if the red-amber-green traffic light signals are used as input , with 110 and 001 to correspond to 1 for advance , and 010 and 100 to correspond to 0 for stop , only three complete cycles through the training data are required to produce a correct response , from a set of weights initially set at zero .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #84:1>
A comparison between a simple perceptron and a digital logic circuit is shown in Fig 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #85:1>
A thorough mathematical analysis of the capabilities of perceptrons was made by Minsky and Papert [ 3 ] .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #86:1>
Minsky M L and Papert S A :

&lsquo; Perceptrons &rsquo; , MIT Press , Cambridge , Mass ( 1969 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #88:1>
They elegantly demonstrated that several important tasks in pattern recognition , for example determining whether a pattern was connected in the topological sense , were beyond the abilities of the perceptron .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #89:1>
Worse than this from the point of view of ANN researchers of the day , they showed that even a pattern as simple as the exclusive-or logical function could not be learned by a perceptron .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #90:1>
The effect of this negative study was to kill most of the interest in ANNs , and divert funding away from neural nets and into artificial intelligence based on conventional predicate logic
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #91:1>
Multilayer perceptrons
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #92:1>
The objections of Minsky and Papert were applicable to any linear net , even those with several layers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #93:1>
In addition , it was concluded that single-layer nets could not have their general capabilities increased by introducing a nonlinear function at the output however complicated its characteristic might be .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #94:1>
They also pointed out that although nets that were not subject to these restrictions might not suffer the same functional limitations , there was no reason to suppose that a learning rule , analogous to the delta rule , could be found that would be guaranteed to converge as was the case with the delta rule for perceptrons .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #95:1>
In spite of these pessimistic prognostications , multi-layer feedforward nets with nonlinear activation functions at each node were studied by a few researchers , since they could be seen to possess sufficient complexity to be outside the scope of Minsky and Papert 's theorems on the functional limitations , and a learning rule was discovered [ 4 ] .

<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #98:1>
Although a convergence theorem does not exist for this generalised delta rule , the multilayer perceptrons ( MLPs ) which are based upon it have been shown to be capable of learning very general tasks , and in practice have solved some practical problems [ 5 ] .

An example of an MLP is shown in Fig 5 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #102:1>
Of course the net could have more nodes and more layers , but the principle of feedforward only is always maintained .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #103:1>
If a typical node in such a structure is represented by node j shown in the figure , where the weight values associated with the connections confluent upon node j are represented by w ij ( ) , then O j , the output from node j , will be given by .... ( 3 ) where
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #104:1>
Thus each typical neural processor performs a nonlinear function of its net input .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #105:1>
The generalised delta learning rule by which the w ij are modified in response to errors has been described fully in an earlier issue of this journal [ 6 ] and the detailed equations need not be repeated here .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #106:1>
The principle of the learning rule is by back-propagation of the error through the net .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #107:1>
The errors E , which are formed of the differences between the teaching signal and the net response at the output layer , are fed back to the previous layer and a set of new error-like parameters formed which are in turn fed back to the previous layer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #108:1>
At each stage , a set of corrections for the weights attached to the connections which feed the inputs to a layer are calculated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-032 #109:1>
MLPs have been studied and applied to some of the image processing and vision problems encountered by the authors and progress is reported in a later section .

SUMMARY
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #2:1>
Attaching the milking machine to the cow is the last remaining major repetitive task that the worker in a modern milking parlour has to perform .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #3:1>
Several groups of research workers are developing robotic systems for this purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #4:1>
The task for the robot of locating the cow 's teats and attaching the machine is complicated by morphological differences between cows and the need to allow the cow freedom to move during the operation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #5:1>
This paper reviews the progress that has been made .

KEYWORDS : Agriculture &semi; Milking &semi; Dairy farming &semi; Position sensing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #7:1>
1 . INTRODUCTION
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #8:1>
Dairy farming is a very important part of world agriculture .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #9:1>
In the UK , for example , the annual value of milk and milk products is about &pound-sign;2.5bn , or about 20% of the total value of agricultural output . 1
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #10:1>
In countries with technically advanced agriculture , milking is done by machine , rather than by hand .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #11:1>
There are different types of machine-milking systems in use in different parts of the world , but in general they all involve the worker driving the cow into a milking parlour where it is confined in a stall , while he cleans the teats , usually by wiping with a cloth , and attaches the cluster of teatcups to the cow 's udder ( Figure 1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #12:1>
Each teatcup is attached to a length of flexible hose through which vacuum is applied to the teatcup to hold it on the udder and to extract the milk .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #13:1>
The teatcups are removed by shutting off the vacuum when the milk flow rate has reduced to minimum level .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #14:1>
Automatic cluster removers are in common use to detect this flow rate , to shut off the vacuum , and to disconnect the machine from the cow by pulling on a cord attached to the teatcups ( Figure 1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #15:1>
In a modern installation with multiple stalls and milking machines , a single cowman 2 milks up to 100 cows per hour .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #16:1>
About 25% of his time is likely to be spent in manoeuvring cows into and out of the parlour , about 35% in cleaning the teats , and about 35% in attaching teatcups to the cow . 2
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #17:1>
Most herds are milked twice a day and , in order to make the intervals between milking as similar as possible , they are milked early in the morning and late in the afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #18:1>
The large proportion of time that the cowman spends on routine operations and the unsocial hours that a cowman is called on to work are the main reasons for the current research into the use of robots for automatic milking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #19:1>
There is no consensus on the form that an automatic milking system should take .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #20:1>
At one extreme is the view that a robot should be used to attach teatcups in an otherwise conventional milking system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #21:1>
This would bring the benefit of relieving the cowman from the most arduous of his tasks , but he would still need to be present to move the cows into and out of the parlour and to clean their teats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #22:1>
At the other extreme , the prospect is held out of an unmanned fully automatic milking stall , to which the cow would present itself for milking , as and when it wished , at any time of the day or night .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #23:1>
Such a system requires that cow movement is controlled automatically , and that there are automatic systems for cleaning the teats , attaching the teatcups and monitoring the behaviour of the cow to ensure that it has not become distressed in the stall . 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #24:1>
Fully automatic voluntary milking offers the extra potential benefits of releasing the cowman from a rigid daily routine , increasing yield through increased milking frequency 4 , reducing the manipulation of cows by allowing them to adopt more natural patterns of behaviour , and improving cow health and welfare by giving the cowman more time to devote to stockmanship .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #25:1>
An economic assessment of fully automatic milking has indicated that annual savings of up to &pound-sign;100 per cow could be made . 5
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #26:1>
However , little is known about the behaviour of cows in such a system - for example , whether feed will have to be used as an inducement to attend for milking - because until recently there has been no system available with which to carry out trials .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #27:1>
Several European research groups , using a variety of approaches , are working on automatic milking ( Appen<l>dix ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #28:1>
No system is yet commercially available .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #29:1>
All the groups have concentrated on developing teatcup attachment robots , since robotic teatcup attachment is the key element of any increased level of automation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #30:1>
Most teatcup attachment robots have reached the stage of being able to attach one or more teatcups to a cow , and to extract milk .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #31:1>
It is difficult to assess the levels of success that have been achieved because no data have been published .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #32:1>
Typical claims are for success rates of more than 90% , but the basis for measurement is not usually clear .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #33:1>
For example , such a claim could mean that teatcups were attached nine times out of ten to a single , selected cow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #34:1>
Alternatively it could mean that teatcups were attached , without fail , to nine out of a herd of ten , randomly selected cows .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #35:1>
Nevertheless it is clear that engineering development work is continuing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #36:1>
2. REQUIREMENTS OF A TEATCUP ATTACHMENT ROBOT
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #37:1>
The task of the robot is to attach a teatcup to each of the four teats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #38:1>
The positions of these are uncertain because cows have a wide variety of udder conformations with teats which vary in size , spacing and angle of projection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #39:1>
It is also well known that the conformation of a given cow varies between milkings , although no data to support this have been published .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #40:1>
The teats are also likely to be moving because , although the cow is confined in the milking stall , welfare considerations do not allow the cow to be restrained from moving during teatcup attachment and milking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #41:1>
A teat location system is therefore required , and the robot must be able to track , or to compensate for , the movements of the cow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #42:1>
To accommodate a realistic range of cow sizes , and to allow for cow movement in the stall , a robot is likely to have to be able to position a teatcup anywhere within a volume approximating to a cube of side 0.5 m .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #43:1>
The positioning accuracy required is less than that of an industrial robot , because a teat is pliable , and the teatcup liner in which it fits is a flexible sleeve ( Figure 2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #44:1>
Positioning accuracy of 2 to 3 mm has been reported as adequate . 6
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #45:1>
Access to the teats is limited by the proximity of the legs and the separation of the teats , which can be less than 50 mm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #46:1>
A dairy parlour is a hostile environment for a robot .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #47:1>
Apart from the contamination generated by the cow , large volumes of water are directed over all equipment in the parlour to maintain high standards of cleanliness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #48:1>
It is not usually practical to maintain any temperature control in the parlour , so the full ambient range can be expected .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #49:1>
Anything beneath the rear half of the cow is liable to be kicked by it , with the consequent risk of damage to the equipment and the cow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #50:1>
The use of restraints to prevent kicking is undesirable because of the animal welfare implications of inhibiting natural behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #51:1>
It is desirable that the robot should be deflected when it is kicked so that the cow is not harmed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #52:1>
In general therefore the inertia of the mechanism should be small . 3
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #53:1>
Single- and three-phase electrical supplies are gene<l>rally available in a milking parlour where they are commonly used to power the milking vacuum pumps , and could be used to power a robot .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #54:1>
Hydraulic power and compressed air are not usually available in a parlour and would have to be supplied specially for the purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #55:1>
If they were provided for a robot they could be used to operate ancillary equipment , for example to open and close gates controlling cow traffic .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #56:1>
Compressed air is sometimes used for such purposes although vacuum , which is always available , is more commonly used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #57:1>
Electrical actuators present extra safety problems because of the large amounts of water that are used in dairy parlours to keep them clean .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #58:1>
3 . AUTOMATIC MILKING SYSTEMS RESEARCH
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #59:1>
3.1 Cow entry
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #60:1>
In all the schemes that have so far been proposed the cow comes to the robot , which works in conjunction with a stall in which the cow is confined during milking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #61:1>
As the cow approaches the stall it is identified automatically by a transponder attached to a collar around the cow 's neck . 7
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #62:1>
This is established technology .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #63:1>
Automatic identification systems are widely used in conventional milking installations for feeding control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #64:1>
The cow is either admitted for milking , or it may be turned away .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #65:1>
A cow may be rejected for reasons of herd management , for example because too little time has elapsed since it was last milked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #66:1>
Once it is in the stall , an automatic dispenser may give the cow a ration of concentrated food , which may be calculated to meet the needs of each individual cow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #67:1>
The food may be used as an inducement for the cow to enter the milking stall .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #68:1>
Whether this is necessary , or whether the prospect of being milked is sufficient inducement , is not yet known .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #69:1>
3.2 Teat location
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #70:1>
Most teatcup attachment robots have a two-stage teat location process in which approximate positioning is followed by fine adjustment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #71:1>
3.2.1 Approximate positioning .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #72:1>
Dead reckoning has been used for approximate positioning , 6,8-12 by steering the robot to a position defined by the co-ordinates of the teats of the cow with respect to a fixed reference point .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #73:1>
In one such system 8 the robot is taught the co-ordinates of a cow 's teats the first time it is milked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #74:1>
These are stored and used as the sole means of positioning the robot for subsequent milkings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #75:1>
Small inaccuracies in positioning are accommodated by using teat cups with wider than normal mouths , with inflatable rims which contract to centre the teat in the cup .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #76:1>
The usefulness of this technique is limited by the variation in teat position caused by the cow moving , unless it is tightly constrained in a way which is likely to be unacceptable on welfare grounds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #77:1>
Other systems compensate for teat-position variation by detecting the positions of the teats relative to the reference point and updating the stored co-ordinates accordingly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #78:1>
Teat positions have been measured directly using an ultrasonic proximity sensor 9 mounted on a robot arm .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #79:1>
This moves laterally , at constant speed , under the cow , so that the sensor scans the udder from the front , and measures the positions of the front two teats in the horizontal plane before the teatcup attachment is attempted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #80:1>
Two scans are made &semi; the second being closer to the position of the teats as indicated by the first .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #81:1>
An accuracy of approximately 1 mm has been achieved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #82:1>
Teat detection is validated by comparing the measured separation of the front two teats to that recorded at the previous milking .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #83:1>
This method has the disadvantage that compensation cannot be made for movement of the cow after the scan has been completed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #84:1>
The technique therefore relies on this movement being less than the detection range of the fine position sensing system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #85:1>
Vision systems also have been used to produce stored teat co-ordinates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #86:1>
In one case , 6 a helium-neon laser which rotates in the vertical plane is used to produce a plane of illumination which sweeps the volume containing the udder ( Figure 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #87:1>
A CCD camera with appropriate filter produces an image in which the portions of the teats that intersect the laser plane can be identified .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #88:1>
The teat co-ordinates are obtained by triangulation from a knowledge of the positions of the camera and the laser and the angle of inclination of the laser plane .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #89:1>
Teat co-ordinates have been updated at a rate of 10 Hz and have been used by a robot to track teat movements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #90:1>
A similar system 10 uses a laser beam to produce an image containing illuminated segments of teats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #91:1>
A common feature of the two systems is that only small portions of the teats are illuminated so that their positions can be determined from small image areas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #92:1>
This is potentially economical in image-processing time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #93:1>
However , a difficulty with this type of system is the possibility of one or two of the teats being obscured from the camera by the other teats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #94:1>
In this case it is necessary to estimate the positions of the obscured teats from their stored positions relative to the visible teats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-033 #95:1>
A further difficulty is that as the robot approaches the teat it obscures the teats from the camera .

reflow model for the anti-fuse
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #3:1>
From an investigation that started in response to questions regarding the safety of some of the reliability conclusions drawn with respect to the the anti-fuse element used in PLDs , Ron Neale proposes a new and elegant model for the operation of the device , that if fully verified will clear any reliability doubts .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #4:1>
At the finest level of granularity , the ele<l>ments that enable the logic function of a pro<l>grammable logic device ( PLD ) to be uniquely de<l>fined can be selected from a list that now includes : conducting links ( anti-fuses ) , fused or blown re<l>sistors , a variety of charge storage MOS devices and static RAM cells .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #5:1>
When the reliability of the programming element is considered the electronics industry appears to be will<l>ing to draw a positive con<l>clusion with respect to SRAMs , MOS devices and open circuit or fused resistors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #6:1>
Conclusions that are based on a clear understanding of the man<l>ner in which those devices operate and experience .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #7:1>
In the context of modern electronics it is unusual for a device to gain widespread accep<l>tance without a clear and verified model of its operation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #8:1>
For example , at the limits in the field of molecular beam epitaxy the detail down to the location of different individual atoms and their functional role is well understood .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #9:1>
Recently questions have been raised as to the reliability of the anti-fuse , particularly in its pro<l>grammed or conducting state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #10:1>
Ignoring those expressions of doubt that are the rationalisation of competitors who have chosen alter<l>native programming elements , there has remained a persistent core of legitimate doubt .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #11:1>
Doubt that has its roots in the lack of a full and unam<l>biguous explanation of the detail by which the conducting link of the anti-fuse is formed and an experience of dielectric breakdown that does not lead to a neat and controllable aftermath .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #12:1>
Even though a considerable amount of reliability data has been published [ 1,2 ] by one manufacturer there are some misgivings with re<l>spect to the safety of the conclusions that have been drawn from those results .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #13:1>
Especially with respect to the extrapolation of the results obtained from high temperature testing down into the more normal operating am<l>bient temperature of the fuse in its programmed state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #14:1>
A new model for the operation of the anti-fuse , summarised in figure 1 , will be presented here that is a good fit with the known observations of the characteristics of the device and re<l>moves any lingering doubts there might be as to the safety of any conclusions regarding reliability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #15:1>
The anti-fuse
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #16:1>
A number of different material com<l>positions are used by different man<l>ufacturers for structures that can be electrically switched from a high re<l>sistance state to form a low resis<l>tance conducting link .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #17:1>
They all have the basic metal-thin film dielectric<l->metal sandwich structure of figure 2 ( a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #18:1>
The dielectric is usually silica ( SiO 2 ) or a layered silica-silicon nitride-silica sandwich composite , other dielectrics such as amorphous silicon are also used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #19:1>
Here devices with dielectrics of a thickness of the order of 100 &Angstrom; will be considered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #20:1>
In operation the applica<l>tion of a voltage of the order 10-20V results in dielectric breakdown and the estab<l>lishment of a permanent conducting link with a resis<l>tance of from 300 to 1000 &Omega; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #21:1>
It is that link that is then used to selectively couple the logical elements of the circuit .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #22:1>
Reliability
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #23:1>
Figure 3 is a summary of the reliability testing that has been published to date for the anti-fuse in its programmed state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #24:1>
At first sight the results would appear to be excellent with no reported fail<l>ures that can be attributed to the fuse itself during conventional acce<l>lerated life tests of approximately 2 x 10 6 programmed fuses .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #25:1>
However , without a detailed under<l>standing of the mechanism of opera<l>tion it is possible that the high tem<l>perature testing at 150 &degree;C and above could be masking failure mechan<l>isms that will be observed if the same tests were carried out at lower tem<l>peratures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #26:1>
The problem of extrapola<l>tion from high to low temperature testing is aggravated when there are no failures ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #27:1>
one or more failures would ease the problem of extrapolation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #28:1>
The rule that runs : NO FAILURES NO MODEL NO EXTRAPOLATION provides the main grounds for ques<l>tioning the safety of the anti-fuse reliability results .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #29:1>
The testing of a small number of Kelvin connected programmed de<l>vices at 250 &degree;C is included in figure 3 , while appearing impressive forces a conclusion of a current density in the filament of &larger-than; 10 9 A / cm 2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #30:1>
Those tests appear to be more a test of the current flow in the surrounding die<l>lectric and add lit<l>tle to the overall reliability picture .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #31:1>
The tests in fig<l>ure 3 that involve cycling unbiased devices between two extremes of temperature are certainly important where the material of the operating device has been rapidly quenched from the molten state without annealing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #32:1>
They should expose any failures caused by built-in stresses , if the ramp rates of 1 minute are of the right order .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #33:1>
The questions
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #34:1>
There are a number of questions related to the mechanism of opera<l>tion that have a direct impact on the safety of the conclusions that can be drawn from the reliability testing of programmed anti-fuse devices .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #35:1>
They are : ( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #36:1>
What is the mechanism re<l>sponsible for the movement of the material from the electrodes to form the conducting filament ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #37:1>
( 2 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #38:1>
What is the disposition of the dielectric replaced by the conduct<l>ing link after programming ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #39:1>
( 3 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #40:1>
What is the structure and composition of the link ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #41:1>
is it : single crystal , polycrystalline , part poly and part single crystal or a mixture of microcrystallites and dielectric ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #42:1>
( 4 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #43:1>
What is the single mechan<l>ism or dual mechanisms that allows allow a conducting filament to grow in the vertical direction immedia<l>tely after breakdown and then at a later time and with the reapplica<l>ton of a higher current to undergo radial growth to a lower resistance state ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #44:1>
( 5 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #45:1>
What is the geometric form of the contact made by the filament to the electrodes or parts of the fila<l>ment to each other ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #46:1>
At this point the reasons why , in the view of this author , the above ques<l>tions are important will follow .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #47:1>
Question ( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #48:1>
What is the physical mechanism responsible for the movement of the material to form the conducting filament ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #49:1>
The reason why it is important to establish this mechanism and the parameters on which it depends is to establish that it ceases in a dis<l>continuous man<l>ner at the current levels involved during operation after program<l>ming .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #50:1>
If it does not cease discontin<l>uously then it could clearly cause the filament to slowly revert to a high resistance state .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #51:1>
What then are the options for mass movement within the device and what guidance can be obtained from the information on the anti fuse that has been published to date . ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #52:1>
Intuitively the first mechanisms to account for mass movement in the situation of the device structure would be electromigration , or diffu<l>sion or a combination of both .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #53:1>
In [ 3 ] there is little information on the mechanism of mass movement in the formation of the link .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #54:1>
The descrip<l>tion that describes a thermal model runs &ldquo; Once the dielectric is ruptured the resistance R1 of the conductive state ( final ) is determined by the size of the conductive conduit ( the intermediate conducting state ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #55:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #X56:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #57:1>
There is no information provided on the mechan<l>ism responsible for the movement of material to form the permanent link .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #58:1>
The patent
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #59:1>
Reference to the basic patent on the anti-fuse [ 4 ] shows the summary of invention to be a little more forthcoming .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #60:1>
In sections 20/25 the patent states , &ldquo; The dielectric layer , .. is such that when it is disrupted by a high electric field , it will facilitate the flow of arsenic material comprising one or both of the two electrodes to produce a controlled radius conductive filament during its breakdown &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #61:1>
In section 40 it states &ldquo; After the formation of the filament and during its formation , arsenic ( Ed note - there is much emphasis within the patent of the role of arsenic with which both electrodes are heavily doped ) will flow from both electrodes and heavily dope the filament ... &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #62:1>
Then in section 45/50 it states , &ldquo; During programming , as the applied voltage reaches the dielectric breakdown value , a localised weak spot in the dielectric starts to carry most of the leaking current and starts to heat up , which in turn increases the leakage current .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #63:1>
.
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #64:1>
With regard to other clues to the mass movement the patent descrip<l>tion does make provision for the possibility of voids as a result of the removal of electrode material .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #65:1>
It also refers to the preventive measures necessary to increase the current carrying capacity of the permanent link to avoid electromigration &ldquo; .. with<l>out the potential for creating a later open circuit due to electromigra<l>tion. . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #66:1>
The role of arsenic is cited
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #67:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #68:1>
Like all good patents the use of the word &ldquo; flow &rdquo; embraces all mechan<l>isms that could possibly move mass and while such a description benefits the inventor , it is not helpful and can act in a negative manner on behalf of a manufacturer when one is trying to asses assess reliability claims .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #69:1>
Questions ( 2 ) &ampersand; ( 3 ) are in part related and at this juncture will be linked together .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #70:1>
Where is the dielectric ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #71:1>
The existing published description of the filament is as indicated in figure 2 ( b ) ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #72:1>
recently [ 5 , a private communi<l>cation ] some TEM evidence has been provided to support part of this claim .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #73:1>
However , the question of a satis<l>factory explanation for the disposi<l>tion of the dielectric still remains unanswered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #74:1>
The possibility that the conducting filament is a mixture of microcrystallites and dielectric is real .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #75:1>
If that is the situation , then the contacts between those crystallites could under some conditions of op<l>eration act to localise current flow and energy deposition .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #76:1>
If in that situation the flux of mater<l>ial moving into the region is not equal to that flowing out by any of a combi<l>nation of say electromigration and diffusion then the local resistance will increase .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #77:1>
Once started the process is likely to become regenerative , moving about the filament with the ultimate effect of moving the resis<l>tance of the device outside its ac<l>ceptable operating range .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #78:1>
If such a mechanism of failure exists then why does it not show up in the elevated temperature reliability testing ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #79:1>
The submission here is that at elevated temperatures the con<l>ductivity of the dielectric is such that it would act to de-localise the current in the region of the contacts between the crystallites by sharing the current in a path electrically in parallel with the contact . figure
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #80:1>
Provided that the problem of the relocation of the dielectric can be accounted for in a satisfactory man<l>ner then the alternatives of a filament that consists of polycrystals of ar<l>senic doped silicon , or one that consists partially of epitaxial re<l>growth terminating on the polycrystal upper electrode , would be satisfac<l>tory from the point of view of reliabil<l>ity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #81:1>
They would be reasonable struc<l>tures for which the high temperature extrapolation could be made .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #82:1>
Radial growth problem
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #83:1>
Question ( 4 ) deals again with the mechanism responsible for mass transport .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #84:1>
Specifically with the ability of the filament , after it has initially been set to one resistance value by the current that is allowed to flow immediately after the dielectric con<l>duction step , to then have its resis<l>tance changed at a later time by the application of a higher current to the permanent filament .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #85:1>
Figure 2 ( b ) illustrates the filament after initial dielectric breakdown ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #86:1>
if as [ 3 ] indicates the filament resistance can be reduced by the re-application of a higher current then a mechanism must be found that can provide for radial growth .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #87:1>
Such a mechanism would need again to account for the disposition of the dielectric .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #88:1>
In the field of electro-crystal<l>lisation , a parabolic crystal growth front is often invoked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #89:1>
A parabolic growth front could in principle pro<l>vide the required three dimensional filament growth mechanism , and as figure 4 illustrates be fed by electro<l->migration through a single sized aperture in the dielectric .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #90:1>
But yet again what is the final disposition of the dielectric that must be moved to allow for the additional radial growth ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #91:1>
( Decomposition would be a compat<l>ible process ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #92:1>
A model of the filament that consists of a mixture of crystallites and dielectric could show a reduc<l>tion in resistance for increased cur<l>rent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #93:1>
The mechanism would be to increase , by electromigration , the vo<l>lume fraction of crystallites within the filament with the effect of lowering the resistance without increasing the ra<l>dius of the filament .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #94:1>
Question 5 above again depends on the mass movement mechanism .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #95:1>
If the filament grows by the move<l>ment of material from one electrode to the other then the arguments rela<l>ting to the integrity of the filament-electrode contact during pulse operation would apply in the same way as the contacts between micro<l>crystallites within the filament as dis<l>cussed earlier .
<ICE-GB:W2A-034 #96:1>
This is of special importance as the patent ( see earlier ) allows this as a region where there might be voids .

<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #1:1>
Three novelties of AI :
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #2:1>
theories , programs and rational reconstructions
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #3:1>
J.A. Campbell
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #4:1>
Most of the difficulty of including AI in the standard collection of sciences is that there are recurring features of the best or most-publicized work in Al that are hard to fit into the conventional observation- hypothesis- deduction- observation pattern of those sciences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #5:1>
Some parts of the difficulty can be clarified and resolved by showing that certain details of what is involved in AI have underlying similarities with corresponding steps in other sciences , despite their superficial differences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #6:1>
The treatment of &lsquo; theories &rsquo; and &lsquo; pro<l>grams &rsquo; below is intended as a commentary on that remark .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #7:1>
A further part of the difficulty is that AI still lacks some scientific credibility because it does not yet seem to have the standard of reproducibility and communicability of results that is built into other sciences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #8:1>
The difficulty is illuminated by activities in AI research that have come to be known as &lsquo; rational reconstruc<l>tions &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #9:1>
While the earliest attempts at rational reconstruction have generally been less than successful , the idea itself is potentially useful as a means of generating new knowledge or mapping out new territory in AI .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #10:1>
On theories , models and representations
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #11:1>
Sciences are supposed to have underlying theories , and techno<l>logies rely on theories through the help of their supporting sciences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #12:1>
The first hesitation among outside observers to give AI full credit for being a science or technology comes from the difficulty of identifying AI 's theory or theories .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #13:1>
It is common for people inside AI to say in response that such a theory may seem unconventional to others merely because it is contained within a program or because it is a program - but this statement has never converted an outsider in my experience .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #14:1>
Instead , it reinforces the hesi<l>tation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #15:1>
An alternative way to tackle this problem of persuasion or education is to ask what are the possible structures of theories , and then to see how AI ( among other subjects ) can claim to respect them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #16:1>
Broadly speaking , there are three types of theories in scientific subjects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #17:1>
One is expressed through equations &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #18:1>
quantum mechanics and special and general theories of relativity are of this type .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #19:1>
A second variety , common in mathematics , is stated in terms of basic entities and operations , plus sets of axioms .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #20:1>
Anything that can be done with the operations and that respects the axioms is a legal consequence of the theory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #21:1>
Here , the axioms act as constraints , helping to specify boundaries and internal structure of the space of possible results or behaviours , but not having much to say about the relative importance of different parts of that space .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #22:1>
The third variety starts from a statement of a general principle or principles , and is capable of particularization in many different forms when the more specific details are filled in .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #23:1>
The general statement is often taken to be the theory , especially by people who can find uses for it without having to supply any more specific details .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #24:1>
What is popularly meant by the Darwinian &lsquo; theory &rsquo; of evolution is probably the best-known example .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #25:1>
All three types of theory are explored routinely through the medium of computer programs when their expected consequences are too complex to generate otherwise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #26:1>
The question of complexity , in the particular case of AI , is discussed further in the next section .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #27:1>
Explorations of theories do not divide into three sharply-defined classes &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #28:1>
there are grey areas on their mutual boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #29:1>
For equation-based theories , the programs are nor<l>mally entirely algorithmic and solve the relevant equations , but there are nevertheless instances of heuristic search for solutions where no algorithm is known .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #30:1>
Campbell ( 1979 ) gives one such example .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #31:1>
In the case of theories relying on axioms or constraints , which are usually mathematical , heuristics that are appropriate for control of the exploration of the space of possible results can be very subtle and reflect such things as a mathematician 's sense of aesthetics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #32:1>
In most of these situations the user and the program act as partners , with the user supplying the subjective evaluations , but it is possible to leave significant aspects of the choice of direction to the program if relatively simple criteria of purpose or optimization are added .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #33:1>
Some exercises in automatic theorem-proving and symbolic mathematical simpli<l>fications are of this kind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #34:1>
For the third class of theory to appear inside a program , it is necessary for its generalities to be backed up by enough specific details to allow the program to compute something of interest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #35:1>
The combination of general and specific information is often described as a model .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #36:1>
In some cases , e.g. in cognitive science , models do not evolve to a finished state on paper before they are written into a program &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #37:1>
particularly if some of the specifics are axiomatic or declarative , the model may be developed through interactive changes to the program until the developer regards the resulting compu<l>tations as sufficiently interesting or relevant .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #38:1>
It is then not unreasonable to speak of the program as the model , particularly if there is no obvious way to summarize the effects of the control mechanisms that have arisen during the development process short of running the programs on numerous test problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #39:1>
Where this picture illustrates a piece of work in AI , the program/model is in fact a fleshed-out basic theory of the third type mentioned above .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #40:1>
Models in AI often fit this last form of description in the details but seem to be open to criticism for lacking the &lsquo; general principles &rsquo; that are either its backbone or its scaffolding .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #41:1>
However , the description gives an equally good account of scientists ' experiments with ( and tuning of ) theoretical con<l>structs of the second or &lsquo; axiomatic &rsquo; kind , where there is no need for the broad organizing principles to exist .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #42:1>
It is rather unlikely that a program<l>mable theoretical construct in AI will be of the first ( equational ) kind , but the second and third kinds of description together cover typical activities in AI research rather well .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #43:1>
Moreover , they cover typical activities in other fields of scientific research equally well .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #44:1>
In terms of adjectives that are now quite popular in discussions of method in AI , these descriptions refer to scruffy theories while equational theories are neat .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #45:1>
Reluctance to regard theory-making or model-making work in AI as respectable can be traced frequently to the mistaken view that the only respectable scientific theories are neat theories .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #46:1>
No example of any of these classes of theories has much claim to being scientifically interesting unless its essence is a representation which associ<l>ates information and definitions in a compressed form that is capable of yielding much more information economically and reproducibly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #47:1>
Represen<l>tations in successful sciences get much of their power of compression by using as building-blocks abstractions which are not-necessarily-intuitive transformations of terms that are themselves accessible to ( say ) lower-division undergraduates studying those sciences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #48:1>
The Hamiltonian formula<l>tion of classical mechanics is a good instance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #49:1>
Similar instances have begun to be recognized in AI .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #50:1>
Representational schemes like first-order logics , semantic nets , version spaces , frames and scripts have already demonstrated their value by providing good service that is not problem-specific , and much activity in AI research involves either explicit or implicit evaluation of the possible usefulness of other schemes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #51:1>
If there is any recurring element in criticism of AI at the level of represen<l>tations , it is that the stock of in AI is not as large or static as in the established sciences and technologies .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #52:1>
But this view is merely another way of saying that the established sciences and technologies are older than AI .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #53:1>
Moreover , representations in any science can change when the science is passing through a lively stage of development .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #54:1>
In that respect , older subjects like elementary-particle physics ( especially where it touches on general relativity ) are just as lively as AI , or vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #55:1>
A theory is not convincing unless it is accompanied by a set of methods that cause it to yield up its information readily .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #56:1>
Normally , a theory and its methods are considered as one entity , but this is likely to be unjust to other subjects besides AI ( where the separation is the rule rather than the exception ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #57:1>
For example , quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) in 1948 looked very different from QED in , say 1955 , because of the post-1948 acceptance of Feynman rules and diagrams as methods that changed the way in which a basically unchanged information-carrying representation ( a classical Ham<l>iltonian formalism extended by quantum-mechanical features which were already in place and well appreciated by 1948 ) could be understood .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #58:1>
One way to see the difference is to compare the coverage of the same general topic by Eliezer ( 1946 ) and Feynman ( 1962 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #59:1>
While AI has not yet shown any equally dramatic shifts of view , the search for methods and techniques is now a recognized part of AI research .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #60:1>
The details of such methods as pattern-directed invocation , propagation of constraints and inheritance of properties are influencing the details of generally-useful representation schemes , and are being influenced by them in turn .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #61:1>
On these interpretations of theory , method and representation , AI needs no extra help to justify membership in the league of sciences .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #62:1>
The primary element of an AI &lsquo; theory &rsquo; is just a representation of information from which substantial consequences can be derived by prescribed methods or operations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #63:1>
To establish the soundness of a theory in principle , the methods ' feasibility need be demonstrated just in principle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #64:1>
In practice , a representation is only useful in AI when it is joined with methods that can extract the consequences in acceptable times and with acceptable demands on computing resources .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #65:1>
The best illustration that this last point is not trivial is that the large-scale use of one class of representations ( first-order logics ) , whose importance was first asserted early in the history of AI , was nevertheless delayed for some time - until the arrival of the computing interpretations and techniques of Prolog , to be exact .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #66:1>
On programs
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #67:1>
The usual way of testing a theory or model is to extract its consequences or predictions for a chosen situation that has few enough controlled variables to allow trustworthy and repeated observations , make observations of the phenomena that have been predicted , and then compare the predictions with what is observed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #68:1>
In this two-stage picture , any step which is not part of the process of observation is part of the process of prediction .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #69:1>
Where typical sciences use computer programs , the programs are auxiliary supports for their pen-and-paper theories rather than indepen<l>dently-interesting objects in the exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #70:1>
( Simulation programs fit the same description if we replace &lsquo; theories &rsquo; by &lsquo; experiments &rsquo; . √≠ . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #71:1>
Given the typical scientific and technological attitudes to programs , what special features of AI justify the opinion that an AI program can be an object with its own scientific importance ?
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #72:1>
The answer seems to be the same as the answer to the question of why a puppet is uninteresting while Frankenstein 's 1 monster is interesting .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #73:1>
The puppet is a purely algorithmic object ( apart from any seemingly random bugs in the implementation ) , perform<l>ing functions that its operator can perform equally well but finds it convenient not to .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #74:1>
Frankenstein 's monster is capable of behaviour that is autonomous and not always predictable or imitatable by the builder or bythe by the experts on the design-standards committee of his professional associa<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #75:1>
This behaviour may occur because the methods of extracting qualita<l>tively new results from the underlying theory are so complex that not all of their consequences can be identified or visualized before the program-execution stage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #76:1>
( The italicized word is used to distinguish this situation from most large conventional programming exercises , but the distinction is not sharp enough to exclude some of the most adventurous large FORTRAN exercises , such as the &lsquo; experimental mathematics &rsquo; of dynamical systems and cellular automata .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #77:1>
A probable lesson for AI is that we should try to accommodate them rather than to exclude them , e.g. by lending them tools for backtracking and heuristic search . )
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #78:1>
It may also occur because the collection of relevant methods is incomplete and because the only way to identify acceptable results is &lsquo; generate and test &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #79:1>
Or , as a member of the US Supreme Court is reported to have said about pornography : &lsquo; I can't define it , but I know it when I see it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2A-035 #80:1>
Whichever of these explanations is responsible for the Frankenstein 's - monster effect in any particular case , the interest of an AI program as such lies in the non-algorithmic complexity of the interaction of components that are not necessarily complex in themselves .

AI TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF WELDING DEFECTS FROM AUTOMATED NDT DATA
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #2:1>
Dr A McNab and Iain Dunlop
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #3:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #4:1>
Introduction
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #5:1>
Automated NDT using specialised mechanical scanners or ROVs has a number of attractions for land-based and offshore application .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #6:1>
These include the permanent recording of position and measured flaw data , improved test speed , accuracy , and reliability of data collection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #7:1>
This is particularly true in hostile environments where operator access is difficult and large areas of the structure must be scanned (1)(2) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #8:1>
Whilst automated scanning techniques are now available , the processing and analysis of flaw data has lagged behind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #9:1>
Whilst skilled interpreters can be employed to investigate the results produced , in situations where data output rates are high , bottlenecks can be created .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #10:1>
This occurs in current land-based automated systems , and looking to the future offshore , it will occur in ROV deployed systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #11:1>
There is thus a significant attraction in using advanced computer techniques which involve artificial intelligence ( AI ) methods such as knowledge-based , feature-extraction , and neural-network systems , to automatically analyse the NDT data in order to identify and characterise flawed regions (3)-(9) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #12:1>
Problems which require some degree of human-like intelligence are tackled with AI although the actual AI approach depends on the type of problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #13:1>
Medical diagnosis , alarm processing and railway scheduling are problems for which data , rules and conditions may be gathered and assembled into a well defined algorithmic structure , usually an expert system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #14:1>
Speech understanding and handwritten character recognition are tasks which cannot be easily solved by conventional techniques since no precise algorithmic solution exists and therefore recognition , rather than computation , forms the basis of the solution .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #15:1>
These recognition methods , such as neural-networks , operate by associating an unknown input pattern with previously encountered patterns and find the closest match .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #16:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #17:1>
Automated Ultrasonic Inspection
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #18:1>
In ultrasonic NDT , weld specimens are scanned in a raster manner by a number of probes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #19:1>
The main beam of each probe is angled differently in order to achieve full coverage of the volume of interest and to give the best possible chance of the beam striking a defect at approximately right angles hence giving a strong specular response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #20:1>
The interaction of an incident ultrasonic beam with a defect can cause a number of different responses .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #21:1>
If the beam strikes the edge of the defect then a diffracted signal will be observed
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #22:1>
but if the beam strikes the defect normally there will be a strong specular response
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #23:1>
and as the incident angle increases away from the normal the smaller the specular response .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #24:1>
Mode converted signals also occur .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #25:1>
It is the interpretation of these responses which forms the basis of defect classification , whether it be an &ldquo; on-the-spot &rdquo; technique such as manual inspection or a data storage technique such as automated inspection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #26:1>
The identification of defect type and the measurement of defect size and orientation is a difficult problem in any area of NDT
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #27:1>
and ultrasonic inspection is no exception .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #28:1>
This problem is made all the more difficult with automated inspection because a very large amount of data needs to be processed , preferably as quickly and accurately as possible , in order that further , more detailed , inspection may be carried out on suspect regions if required .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #29:1>
Due to the volume of data involved , compromises must be made in terms of data storage
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #30:1>
and this often involves &ldquo; range-gating &rdquo; responses so that only significant signal values are noted , usually the peaks of the echo .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #31:1>
Obviously , the fewer amplitude values stored , the more difficult is the task of interpreting the data and achieving accurate defect characterisation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #32:1>
The stored parameters from a reflected beam signal are : &dot; The x , y , z position of the probe &dot; The &ldquo; range-gated &rdquo; amplitudes &dot; The time on the A-Scan where these amplitudes occurred
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #33:1>
This information together with the knowledge of the beam angle allows the x,y,z position and amplitude of each &ldquo; significant &rdquo; value to be calculated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #34:1>
Once the probe has moved over the complete surface of interest , all the three dimensional data points may be combined to form a 3D &ldquo; picture &rdquo; of the volume .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #35:1>
3 . Data Interpretation
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #36:1>
In NDT the conventional method of presenting 3D data is as 3 orthogonal views , one view for each of the x , y , and z directions ( B , C and D-Scans ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #37:1>
Ideally these representations would show a perfectly formed image of the defect but ultrasonics does not afford this luxury and the B , C , and D-Scans typically illustrate only an abstract view of the defect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #38:1>
For example , a smooth linear defect angled at 45 &degree; to the surface and scanned at 0 &degree; would be displayed as two diffraction arcs on the B-Scan as Figure 1b illustrates .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #39:1>
Since the same B-Scan pattern would have been achieved if there were two point defects at the position of the defect tips , this illustrates that data from a single probe is insufficient for defect classification .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #40:1>
Reference to the B , C , and D-Scans for other probes is usually necessary to deduce the nature of the defect ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #41:1>
for example , reference to the B-Scan for the 45&degree; probe ( Figure 1c ) would allow more accurate categorisation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #42:1>
By combining the B-Scans for the 0&degree; and 45&degree; probes one is able to infer that the defect is inclined at 45 &degree; to the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #43:1>
Reference to the C and D-Scans would allow the linear nature of the defect to be established .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #44:1>
This method of processing the data is rather cumbersome
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #45:1>
and , when large amounts of data are involved , such as that from an automatic inspection , it is very time-consuming .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #46:1>
One solution to this problem is to merge all available probe data into a single image thereby combining the important features of each individual image and also reducing the amount of processing required .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #47:1>
The data from each probe scan provides a different &ldquo; clue &rdquo; as to the nature of the defect &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #48:1>
most probes will show the diffracted responses from the defect edges which highlight the physical extent of the flaw whereas other probes will show the specular response from the surface of the defect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #49:1>
The superposition of these responses results in an image which combines all the individual clues thus making accurate classification that much easier .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #50:1>
An example of the superposition technique is illustrated in Figure 2 where a smooth linear defect is scanned by 3 probes and the B-Scans superimposed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #51:1>
This figure illustrates that the relatively low amplitude diffraction arcs from the 45&degree; probes tend to combine to highlight the crack tips while the high amplitude specular signal from the 0&degree; probe emphasises the surface of the defect .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #52:1>
Although the final image is by no means an accurate physical representation of the defect shape it does have the approximate characteristics of the actual flaw .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #53:1>
Many of these characteristics are difficult to visually extract but , as the next section will illustrate , mathematical analysis of the image can pick out many important features .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #54:1>
The presentation of a 3D object as a number of 2D views provides difficulties in determining the nature of the object and these problems are apparent in conventional ultrasonic data interpretation where three orthogonal displays are normally employed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #55:1>
Depending on the orientation of the defect these 3 views may be enough to establish the 3D nature of a contained object , for instance if a planar shape is inclined to a single axis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #56:1>
If this plane were inclined again to another axis , quickly establishing the nature of the defect visually would be quite difficult .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #57:1>
If many more views of the object were available the shape could be more easily established
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #58:1>
but this is not really practical with automated inspection data given the large volumes of data gathered .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #59:1>
A system which takes as its input the 3-dimensional amplitude/positional data from an automated inspection system and automatically processes the information , outputting a defect classification , has great potential in the NDT field , minimising the problems of the traditional time-consuming , arduous analysis of large volumes of data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #60:1>
4 . Shape Recognition of Weld Defects
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #61:1>
4.1 Weld defect categories
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #62:1>
There are many possible defects that may occur in components , some which can lead to long-term fatigue and others which will cause few eventual problems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #63:1>
It is important in NDT inspection to be able to differentiate between these two categories so that problems of structural integrity are spotted early .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #64:1>
The physical shape of the defect is a major indicator of its significance and it is very important to establish this factor as well as estimating the approximate size and orientation of the flaw .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #65:1>
The physical shape of a weld defect generally falls into one of four shape categories ( 10 ) : ( i ) Point-like eg Point reflector ( ii ) Linear eg Slag line ( iii ) Planar eg Unfused land ( iv ) Volumetric eg Porosity
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #66:1>
A more detailed classification would categorise many defects as rough , smooth , broken etc
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #67:1>
but for the purposes of this discussion only a general shape classification is performed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #68:1>
4.2 Shape Recognition
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #69:1>
Due to the problems of visual shape recognition , especially in 3 dimensions , computer-based recognition provides one possible solution .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #70:1>
Since computers cannot &ldquo; see &rdquo; in the conventional sense , shape recognition must be done in an abstract manner
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #71:1>
and the implementation of this is normally broken down into a two-stage problem : ( I ) Feature Extraction ( II ) Pattern Classification
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #72:1>
Feature extraction is the process of taking a physical shape and extracting a number of features which firstly will uniquely identify the shape as different from all other shapes and secondly are independent to internal variations of the shape , for example , rotation , translation and scaling .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #73:1>
For example , suppose one wished to distinguish a rectangle from a triangle one might choose a discriminatory feature such as the number of sides of each shape .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #74:1>
But , if one wished to discriminate between a rectangle , a triangle and a parallelogram an additional feature would need to be selected since the rectangle and the parallelogram have the same number of sides .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #75:1>
It is therefore necessary to develop a feature extraction system which allows discrimination between as many shapes as necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #76:1>
In computer techniques an object will normally be represented as a set of data points distributed in space , the more data points used the more &ldquo; solid &rdquo; the object since the data-set is essentially a &ldquo; discrete &rdquo; version of the solid shape .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #77:1>
Another feature of a shape recognition system should be an ability to recognise an object which is represented by relatively few data points , that is , the object is &ldquo; corrupted &rdquo; in some way .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #78:1>
Pattern classification is the process of taking the features generated by the feature extraction phase and relating these with each shape class .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #79:1>
The type of pattern classification technique applied will depend on the characteristics of the generated feature set .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #80:1>
If the features selected have well defined mathematical principles which relate to the physical nature of the shape then a simple algorithm will normally be sufficient to associate the feature set with a shape category .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #81:1>
Alternatively , if the feature set consists of abstract numerical parameters then some form of pattern recognition , such as neural networks , will be required in order to relate the feature set to previously encountered examples .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #82:1>
A neural network is a system for modelling the parallel structure of the brain and achieving something of its ability to recognise and learn complex patterns (11) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #83:1>
It is able to extract conclusions from the incomplete knowledge of a problem for which no clearly defined algorithm exists and has a number of distinct advantages over conventional computing techniques : ( i ) High speed due to the inherently parallel structure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #84:1>
( ii ) An ability to learn by example rather than through explicit programming .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #85:1>
( iii ) Robustness due to the parallel nature which allows components of the structure to malfunction without large adverse effects .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #86:1>
5 . Shape Classification Techniques
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #87:1>
The previous sections outlined the problems associated with ultrasonic data interpretation and concluded that automated shape recognition techniques would be useful for the evaluation of the three dimensional information .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #88:1>
The four shape categories associated with weld defects have been highlighted and two methods , utilising the fundamentals of shape recognition and AI , are now proposed for the classification of these shape types .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #89:1>
The methods are : 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #90:1>
Best-Fit Analysis 2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #91:1>
Triangulation Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #92:1>
5.1 Best-Fit Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #93:1>
The first method is a Best-Fit Analysis technique which calculates the best-fit point , line and plane through a three-dimensional data array and uses the amplitude-weighted mean distance from the data points to these features to infer the shape of the data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #94:1>
5.1.1 Method description
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #95:1>
One method of statistically analysing a set of data is by a technique known as regression (12) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-036 #96:1>
Regression is commonly used by statisticians to calculate the best-fit through a set of data points in order to establish how close the data is to the ideal .

2.3.4
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #2:1>
Active microwave or radar imaging
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #3:1>
Artifical Artificial microwave energy used in radar remote sensing spans the 1-30 cm range .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #4:1>
It is usually in the form of a coherent single wavelength , like a laser , generated electronically .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #5:1>
Deployed in its most simple form , radar energy is directed vertically downwards as a pulse for a few microseconds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #6:1>
The time taken for the pulse reflected by the surface to travel back to the antenna is a very accurate measure of the average distance from the platform to the patch of surface illuminated by the pulse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #7:1>
This is the basis of radar altimetry from orbit , most usefully analysed over the oceans .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #8:1>
As we shall see in Fig. 3.15 , given enough orbits a low-resolution image of the average elevation of the ocean surface can be produced , from which extremely interesting deductions can be made about bathymetry and the gravita<l>tional field .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #9:1>
To produce high-resolution radar images a fundamentally different strategy from all other remote-sensing methods is employed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #10:1>
Radar pulses emitted by an antenna are directed downwards and to the side , so illuminating a narrow strip perpendicular to the flight path of the platform ( Fig. 2.23 ( a ) ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #11:1>
The motion of the platform is used to build up a continuous image by careful synchronization of subsequent pulses with platform velocity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #12:1>
As described earlier , part of the sideways-directed energy is reflected away from the antenna and some is scattered back to it , depending on the attitude of the surface and its roughness .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #13:1>
The time at which the back-scattered pulse is received is proportional to the distance that it has travelled , and the energy at that time records the interaction with the surface at the corresponding distance ( Fig. 2.23 ( b ) ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #14:1>
At its most simple , a radar image is built up by the modulation of the brightness along a succession of lines on a cathode-ray tube or on film by the energy-time history of successive pulses ( Fig. 2.23 ( c ) ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #15:1>
This is corrected for the geometry of the system - the angle of the radar beam relative to the surface decreases with distance to the side - to produce an image with a constant scale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #16:1>
Another consequence of the angular geometry is that the resolution perpendicular to the track of the platform , range resolution , falls off in inverse proportion to the cosine of the incidence angle .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #17:1>
The resolution parallel to the track , azimuth resolution , is inversely proportional to the length or aperture of the antenna .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #18:1>
The main problem with this simple real-aperture radar imagery is that the beam spreads out with distance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #19:1>
This means that resolution parallel to the platform track - azimuth resolution - decreases dramatically with range .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #20:1>
Because azimuth resolution is inversely proportional to antenna aperture , above about 10 km real aperture radar is virtually useless &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #21:1>
to maintain acceptable resolution the antenna must be huge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #22:1>
This is where the coherent nature of radar proves extremely useful .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #23:1>
At any instant only the illuminated surface directly to the side of the platform is stationary relative to the platform .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #24:1>
Those parts ahead of and behind are moving towards and away from the platform ( Fig. 2.24 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #25:1>
As a result the radar pulse scattered back from them suffers a Doppler shift , so increasing and decreasing radar frequency , respectively .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #26:1>
The frequency of the returned radar energy is combined with a reference frequency equal to that emitted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #27:1>
The shifted returns interfere with the reference , and so code information from ahead , aft , and to the side for every pulse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #28:1>
This effectively allows a short antenna to mimic one up to several hundred metres long , hence the name synthetic-aperture radar or SAR .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #29:1>
The Doppler history of each pulse is recorded digitally or on film in the form of a radar hologram , requiring a second stage of digital or optical processing to give an image whose azimuth resolution is independent of flying height .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #30:1>
Despite the great complexity of the method , SAR is the only means whereby the great advantages of radar imaging can be deployed from orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #31:1>
2.4
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #32:1>
Sources of remotely sensed data
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #33:1>
Airborne remote-sensing systems are clearly the most flexible sources of data , and provide the most detailed information .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #34:1>
However , there are so many aerial survey companies , using both photography and electronic systems , that a comprehensive account would be too lengthy for this book .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #35:1>
This section concentrates on publically publicly available data from satellites .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #36:1>
There are three basic types of orbit that cover satellites producing remotely sensed data .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #37:1>
All attempt to maintain a nearly constant height so that data are acquired at a uniform scale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #38:1>
If a satellite is placed in orbit around 41,000 km away and its motion is parallel to that of the Earth 's rotation , its velocity matches that of the Earth and it remains above a fixed point on the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #39:1>
Such a geostationary satellite can monitor almost an entire hemisphere all the time , and can transmit directly to any point on that hemisphere .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #40:1>
This is of particular use for climatic observations , but the distance means that resolution is very coarse .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #41:1>
To get a sharper view of the planet means a lower orbit and a narrower field of view .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #42:1>
To obtain full global coverage requires the orbit to pass close to the poles and that successive orbits move progressively around the Earth , so that ultimately the fields viewed by the instruments overlap completely .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #43:1>
The other important consideration , for passive remote sensing , is that the orbits should cross all parts of the Earth when they are illuminated by the sun at the same time of day .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #44:1>
This is so that results can be compared from one area to another .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #45:1>
Such sun-synchronous polar orbits are limited to a height of between 600 and 950 km .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #46:1>
They must be inclined relative to the Equator to ensure correct timing and eventual global coverage ( Fig. 2.25 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #47:1>
The details of each orbit , together with the width of the swathe covered by the imaging system , determine the rate at which full coverage is repeated .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #48:1>
Where remote sensing uses an active method , such as radar , matching orbits to the same time of day is not important .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #49:1>
Moreover , both the ascending ( northward ) and descending ( southward ) orbits can be used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #50:1>
The need for eventual re-entry and power considerations have meant that , up to the present , polar-orbiting manned satellites are impractical .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #51:1>
The orbits of manned craft are limited to about 50&degree; north and south of the Equator , ruling out synchronization with the sun and global coverage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #52:1>
They have rarely orbited higher than about 300 km .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #53:1>
Until the building of the NASA/ESA space station in the mid- to late-1990s , which will be in sun<l>synchronous polar orbit , manned platforms are limited to the acquisition of data on an experimental basis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #54:1>
Since the 1960s a very large number of satellites that deployed remote-sensing instruments have been launched .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #55:1>
To list and describe them all would take up too much space here and would be confusing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #56:1>
Only a selection are covered to illustrate the kinds of data that are easily available .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #57:1>
The main controls over the kind and quality of data provided by any platform are partly governed by the optical characteristics of the devices employed on a satellite and by the rate at which data can be transmitted to the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #58:1>
For instance , the same system viewing a 60 km by 60 km area from a low orbit could transmit data to give 10 m resolution , but used in geostationary orbit to cover a whole hemisphere would have to be restricted to 5 km resolution using the same data transmission rate .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #59:1>
The advantage of low-resolution geostationary systems is that they can provide continuous information , and so they are the work-horses for climatic , atmospheric , and gross oceanographic monitoring .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #60:1>
They are often referred to as metsats .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #61:1>
Currently there are six such platforms stationed above the Equator , covering the Americas and East Pacific ( GOES-E and - W , USA ) , Africa and Europe ( Meteosat , European Space Agency ) , the Indian Ocean ( GOMS , USSR &semi; Insat , India ) and the West Pacific ( GMS , Japan ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #62:1>
The main instrument on all these satellites is some form of imaging device , exemplified by the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer ( VISSR ) aboard the GOES satellites .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #63:1>
The VISSR is a day and night monitor of visible ( 900 m pixels , 550-700 nm ) and thermal infrared ( 6.9 km pixels , 1O.5-12.6 &mu;m ) that obtains images of cloud cover , cloud-top , and surface temperature .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #64:1>
As the name suggests , this instrument uses the spinning motion of the satellite to scan the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #65:1>
At each revolution the optics are tilted slightly so that successive scans cover adjacent strips across the globe .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #66:1>
By this means an image of the hemisphere below is built up over a period of about half an hour , giving very detailed coverage of the changes in large-scale weather patterns .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #67:1>
The equivalent of VISSR aboard Meteosat is also equipped with a channel aimed at thermal emission by water vapour in the atmosphere in the 5.7-7.1 &mu;m region , whose function is described in Chapter 3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #68:1>
Another system carried by geostationary metsats is non-imaging , and uses filters covering the range 3.94-14.74 &mu;m for atmospheric sounding .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #69:1>
This relies on the different transparencies of the atmosphere to radiation of different wavelengths , to build up records of temperature and moisture contents at different levels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #70:1>
On GOES satellites this is called the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder , or VAS .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #71:1>
Figures 3.2 , 3.3 , and 3.9 give examples of data produced by a geostationary platform .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #72:1>
Geostationary satellites also relay information from ground-based sensors , such as river gauges , earthquake monitors , and unmanned meteorological stations , to data-handling centres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #73:1>
Images are streamed continuously to ground stations so that regular updates of hemispheric conditions can be used by climatologists and meteorologists .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #74:1>
The images are distributed to users as low-resolution facsimiles by telephone , sometimes using the GOES satellites as data relays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #75:1>
More detailed meteorological and oceanographic monitoring is the function of polar orbiting , sun-synchronous satellites with a wide swathe of coverage .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #76:1>
Currently there is only one series of satellites that provide publically provides publicly available data - the TIROS/NOAA series operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , of which four are operational or on standby .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #77:1>
Another series operated by NASA as the source of data for experimental work ended with the abandonment of Nimbus -7 in 1984 , but Nimbus data are still used widely for research .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #78:1>
Both types are literally bristling with instruments ( Fig. 2.26 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #79:1>
Of the four operational TIROS/NOAA platforms two are &lsquo; turned on &rsquo; and are synchronized to overpass at 07.30 and 19.30 , and 14.30 , and 02.30 local solar time , giving a six-hourly repetition of all points .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #80:1>
The main instrument is a line-scan system called the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) , which produces images in five wavebands ( visible red , VNIR , 3.55-3.93 , 10.3-11.3 , and 11.5-12.5 &mu;m thermal infrared thermal infrared ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #81:1>
The resolution of the AVHRR allows a pixel size of 1.1 km for points directly beneath the satellite , decreasing in resolution as the scan reaches to either side of the orbit path .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #82:1>
The image swathe is 2400 km wide , and because this is achieved by a large scanning angle the edges of the swathe are extremely foreshortened and distorted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #83:1>
AVHRR data can be recorded in 4000 km long strips at full 1.1 km resolution for local area cover ( LAC ) , or degraded to 5 km resolution for global mosaics ( GAC ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #84:1>
Because the ground track of successive orbits is shifted west by 821 km , full global cover is possible twice each day .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #85:1>
The AVHRR provides most of the images used in many weather forecasts , which are transmitted as facsimiles either directly to the user or by telephone from ground receiving stations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #86:1>
Figures 3.1 , 3.8 , 3.40 , 3.41 , 3.53 , and 4.7 are examples of various types of AVHRR images .
<ICE-GB:W2A-037 #87:1>

Mapping a Mascot 3 design into Occam
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #2:1>
by Dick Knowles
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #3:1>
Mascot is the MOD preferred software design method for embedded software systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #4:1>
It has been widely used , both with and without toolsets , for the design of software written in Pascal and CORAL 66 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #5:1>
A report of a study funded by RSRE proposed how to implement Mascot 3 systems using Ada .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #6:1>
This paper builds on that study to propose a mapping to allow Mascot 3 to be used with Occam .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #7:1>
The proposed method is easy to use without a toolset and appears to produce efficient Occam programs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #8:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #9:1>
Introduction
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #10:1>
Mascot ( Modular Approach to Software Construction Oper<l>ation and Test ) is a proven design method for large embed<l>ded software systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #11:1>
It is the MOD standard design method for these systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #12:1>
Mascot 2 has been in use since 1976 and a number of toolsets have been developed to support it .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #13:1>
In 1987 the Mascot 3 handbook was published [ 1 ] , and toolsets are now being developed to support Mascot 3 with Ada .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #14:1>
The transputer has many benefits for embedded systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #15:1>
It offers considerable computing power for a small package size and is designed to allow simple physical design of multiprocessor systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #16:1>
Ada is now available for trans<l>puters , but no toolsets are available and Ada 's support for multiprocessor systems is minimal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #17:1>
This paper proposes a means by which Mascot can be used to develop Occam systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #18:1>
2
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #19:1>
Alternative approaches
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #20:1>
2.1
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #21:1>
Use of a Mascot kernel
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #22:1>
The initial approach explored was to develop a Mascot kernel for the transputer and to use it in some benchmark applications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #23:1>
This kernel included the full set of Mascot 3 primitives and a subset of control and monitoring .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #24:1>
It was used in Occam versions of the two benchmark systems developed during the Mascot 3 with Ada study [ 2 ] .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #25:1>
The performance of the benchmarks was promising , but other results were poor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #26:1>
The most serious problem was con<l>cerned not with the kernel itself but with the building of systems from their component Mascot units .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #27:1>
Mascot 3 separates interface specification modules from both modules that require them and modules that provide them .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #28:1>
Interfaces contain procedure , function and possibly data declarations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #29:1>
Activity modules , which are scheduled by a kernel , require access interfaces in ports .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #30:1>
Ida ( Intercommunication data area ) modules , which provide access interfaces in windows , manage the sharing of data between activities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #31:1>
The kernel provides synchronisation and exclusion primitives for Idas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #32:1>
Ports and windows are con<l>nected by paths .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #33:1>
Occam does not allow the separate compilation of a unit with multiple outer level procedure declarations .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #34:1>
This means that Idas cannot be compiled separately .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #35:1>
Systems therefore have to be built by copying the text of Idas and activities into single compilation units .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #36:1>
The mappings into Ada proposed by the Mascot 3 with Ada study required similar copying .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #37:1>
The report therefore recommended development of toolsets to do this automati<l>cally .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #38:1>
This could also be done with Occam , but the per<l>formance of the compilation system would suffer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #39:1>
Without a toolset , these problems would cause the programmer con<l>siderable difficulties and lead to errors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #40:1>
The reduction in compilation speed would also be particularly visible and annoying .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #41:1>
This problem is specific to Immos Occam and Pascal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #42:1>
It seems that other suppliers may be producing compilers that are suitable for separate compilation of Mascot Idas .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #43:1>
The 3L Parallel C and Pascal compilers appear to be of this type .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #44:1>
Such compilers will also support the mapping proposed by this paper , and the results below show that this may be preferable in some systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #45:1>
2.2
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #46:1>
Use of Occam concurrent features
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #47:1>
One of the changes between Mascot 2 and 3 is that Mascot 3 systems are not mandated to use the standard Mascot primitives .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #48:1>
Instead , they allow &lsquo; the ( Mascot ) model to be mapped onto equivalent features in a concurrent language &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #49:1>
This approach was therefore considered and found to be far more attractive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #50:1>
It is the approach proposed by this paper .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #51:1>
Occam expects separately compiled procedures to com<l>municate via Occam channels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #52:1>
An Ida written as a separ<l>ately compiled procedure can operate by accepting access procedure calls as messages from an Occam channel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #53:1>
Access interfaces can be mapped as Occam channel proto<l>cols .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #54:1>
Individual access procedures can be mapped as variants of this protocol .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #55:1>
With this mapping , the distinction between Idas and activities can still be retained , and this was found to be an efficient method of implementing Occam systems .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #56:1>
3
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #57:1>
Benchmark results
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #58:1>
Table 1 shows the performance of the benchmarks using the proposed Occam mapping .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #59:1>
It compares these results figure1 with the Occam kernel mapping and with results extracted from the Mascot 3 with Ada report .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #60:1>
These results shows show that the proposed transputer/Occam combination can be expected to outperform many other combinations , although the ratio will vary by application .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #61:1>
The mapping method proposed is at least partly responsible for this performance .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #62:1>
Unconstrained use of Occam tended to lead to less efficient solutions .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #63:1>
A number of comments should be made about the results .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #64:1>
&bullet; First First , the hardware used for the transputer results was a T414 running at 15 MHz with 150 nS memory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #65:1>
With faster transputers , the results could be improved by at least a factor of 2 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #66:1>
&bullet; Second , the very small program sizes reflect the trans<l>puter's transputer 's ability to multi-task without any runtime executive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #67:1>
The large program sizes of the other systems show how the application code size can be overwhelmed by the runtime system .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #68:1>
&bullet; The results for the Occam kernel mapping show an increase in code size to include the kernel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #69:1>
The times are typical of a range of kernels that were implemented with different implementation strategies and complexity .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #70:1>
With the proposed mapping , there is no kernel to support Mascot control and monitoring .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #71:1>
If these facilities are required , an alternative approach would have to be used .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #72:1>
However , the Mascot facilities that allow reusable modules to be combined into a variety of module and subsystem test harnesses are fully supported .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #73:1>
The results for the other systems may have been improved by versions of compilers released since Reference 2 was published .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #75:1>
Mapping rules
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #76:1>
This Section describes the proposed rules for creating an Occam program from a Mascot 3 design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #77:1>
It is addressed to readers who have some knowledge of Mascot 2 or 3 and Occam .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #78:1>
It is assumed that the Mascot 3 design has already progressed to the stage of graphical and textual representa<l>tions described in the official handbook .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #79:1>
To prevent confu<l>sion between Occam channels and Mascot Channels , all text referring to Mascot Channels will use a capital C .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #80:1>
The basic rules are that &square; each Mascot 3 template unit is mapped as a separately compiled Occam procedure &semi; &square;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #81:1>
all Mascot 3 definition and interface units are mapped into one or more Occam libraries &semi; &square;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #82:1>
each Mascot 3 path is mapped as one or two Occam channels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #83:1>
In parameters pass through one channel &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #84:1>
any out parameters pass through the optional channel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #85:1>
Dummy parameters have to be added in some cases &semi; &square;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #86:1>
access interfaces are mapped as Occam protocols .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #87:1>
A variant protocol is used for interfaces with more than one access procedure &semi; &square;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #88:1>
each access procedure call from an activity is mapped as a channel write of all in parameters , followed by a read of any out or synchronisation parameters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #89:1>
In cases where there is no parameter , dummy parameters are introduced &semi; &square;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #90:1>
each Ida is mapped as a main loop reading in a single ALT statement from all channels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #91:1>
It is not possible to give a definitive set of rules in this paper .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #92:1>
Instead , two examples are given showing how the mapping is achieved .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #93:1>
5
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #94:1>
Simple Mascot Channel example
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #95:1>
This first example is a subset of the program that was used as the Channel benchmark .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #96:1>
It uses the traditional Mascot buffered Channel in a test network .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #97:1>
The Mascot 3 network is shown in Fig. 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #98:1>
The Mascot 3 and Occam versions of the definition and access interface units are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #99:1>
The Occam Figures use the conventions of the Inmos folding editor .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #100:1>
The lines start<l>ing ... represent hidden folds containing additional lines of text .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #101:1>
The sections bounded by &left-cbrack; &left-cbrack; &left-cbrack; &right-cbrack; &right-cbrack;} symbols show the contents of such folds .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #102:1>
The comment on the ... line is the same as that on the { { { line .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #103:1>
The absence from Occam of records and user-defined types causes difficulties when mapping definition units .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #104:1>
In this example , objects of the position type have been mapped as arrays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #105:1>
The Occam version of the definition unit defines constants , with the same names as the record fields , that can be used to index position arrays .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #106:1>
Access interface get is mapped as two Occam protocols :
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #107:1>
one is used to send a dummy Boolean parameter to the Channel to request a record &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #108:1>
the other is used to return the record .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #109:1>
Variant protocols are not required because there is only one procedure in the access interface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #110:1>
The Mascot and Occam versions of the Channel are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #111:1>
The Occam version shows the stan<l>dard structure for the Occam mapping of an Ida .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #112:1>
The library defining the access interfaces has been USE d USEd .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #113:1>
The windows provided by the unit are declared as channel parameters of the procedure (
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #114:1>
the put access interface in this example does not need an out channel ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #115:1>
These declara<l>tions use the Mascot 3 window and access procedure names suffixed with . in or . out to distinguish the two channels .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #116:1>
The body of the procedure is a loop , reading from all input channels with a single ALT statement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #117:1>
Fig. 6 shows the contents of the hidden gw window fold of the previous Figure .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #118:1>
In this example , because there is no variant protocol , guards can be used on the input statement .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #119:1>
In the normal case , synchronisation is achieved by delaying the response on the output channel of the interface ( possibly passing a dummy response parameter ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #120:1>
Idas must be designed so that access procedure calls from different windows are accepted while responses are delayed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #121:1>
The Mascot design will show the concurrency required by the external hardware connections and that for potential division of the solution across multiple processors .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #122:1>
This concurrency is achieved by Occam PAR statements in the Mascot composite modules .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #123:1>
Additional PAR statements are likely to lead to inefficiency .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #124:1>
Where access procedures are used by more than one window , common procedures can be declared to be called from the ALT statements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #125:1>
If an access interface is called by more than one Mascot unit , an array of Occam channels must be declared .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #126:1>
Each channel can then be dedicated to a single Occam process pair .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #127:1>
In this version of the Mascot Channel , the guard test con<l>sists of a check on the number of messages in the buffer .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #128:1>
This was found to be faster than the normal comparison of pointers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #129:1>
It is not possible in normal Mascot implementa<l>tions to use this method because the count variable cannot be safely updated from both reading and writing access pro<l>cedures .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #130:1>
Writing of Idas is simplified in Occam , since all accesses to the Ida operate in the same process and all data are therefore implicitly coherent .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #131:1>
The Mascot 3 and Occam forms of the test network description are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #132:1>
The Occam can be derived from either the textual or graphical form of Mascot 3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #133:1>
The used templates are declared by attaching them to their Occam declarations , (
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #134:1>
in some cases , such as Mascot library templates , they could be placed in an Occam library and USE d USEd ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #135:1>
Unlike the Mascot 3 design language , it is necessary in Occam to declare all paths explicitly .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #136:1>
These paths must then be connected to both their ports and windows .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #137:1>
The defini<l>tion and access interface declarations of the channels are accessed by the USE statements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #138:1>
The instantiations of the templates are mapped as pro<l>cedure calls passing the constants and path connections as parameters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #139:1>
6
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #140:1>
Track pool example
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #141:1>
This example is a subset of the program that was used for the pool benchmark .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #142:1>
It contains a simple pool Ida that manages aircraft track entries .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #143:1>
It is required to allow updat<l>ing of track entries by data from several sensors using a read and lock procedure call ( prior to writing ) and a write and unlock procedure call ( to complete writing ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #144:1>
Read only access by other windows must be allowed while a track entry is locked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-038 #145:1>
Its graphical Mascot form is shown in Fig. 9 .

The paper considers the requirements for the determination of the manoeuvring and control characteristics of marine vehicles in design and subsequently in operation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #5:1>
A review is conducted of the methods currently available to determine manoeuvring characteristics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #6:1>
These include physical model tests , empirical estimation methods based on previous ship data and various calculation methods .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #7:1>
Consideration is then given to the prospects of a computational method being successful in view of the difficulties and complexities of the fluid flow problem for a body in general motion and with a free surface .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #8:1>
The paper concludes with a discussion of the virtues of the derivative approach , commonly used to describe and simulate the characteristics of ship response &semi; and debates whether a more direct approach to the determination of ship responses in which derivatives are combined may be an avenue for further research , noting that some approaches of this type appear to be promising .

Introduction
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #11:1>
The purpose of this paper is to review the techniques currently available for the prediction of the manoeuvring characteristics with the particular viewpoint of design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #12:1>
The task of design is to define a vehicle to transit on or in water for the transportation of cargo , people or equipment to be used at sea .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #13:1>
In the present context it is the vehicular characteristics of power , motions , structure and control which matter most ( figure 1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #14:1>
The size of the craft is mainly dictated by the transport requirements and it is the proportions and shape over which the designer can exercise some control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #15:1>
With so many interactions to consider it is usual for these shape parameters to acquire some finality early in the design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #16:1>
There is therefore a need for some form of reasonably accurate prediction methods to be available at the stage of design selection .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #17:1>
Despite the inherent complexities of hydrodynamic behaviour , reasonable methods are available for the initial estimates of resistance and powering performance and ship motion characteristics in a seaway .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #18:1>
Though such methods may not be exact in absolute terms they provide a useful comparative performance tool to aid design choice .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #19:1>
The situation regarding the assessment of manoeuvring characteristics appears much less satisfactory .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #20:1>
There appears to be little in the way of a validated technique to ensure that a design has acceptable characteristics or even that the committed features of a design allow sufficient scope for later detailed investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #21:1>

<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #22:1>
The requirements for the manoeuvrability and control of waterborne vessels
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #23:1>
Powering is a directly quantifiable topic , the ship is required to achieve speed or economic fuel consumption .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #24:1>
Structure is also quantifiable in that material limits should not be exceeded though the encountered loading is more difficult to determine .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #25:1>
Motions are more subjective but acceptable standards can be aimed for .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #26:1>
Manoeuvring is less easy to put into a quantifiable assessment .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #27:1>
A general requirement for a vessel is that it can maintain a good course at sea without too much activity of the control systems to maintain it on the prescribed heading .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #28:1>
This requirement exists not simply for calm water but in the general encounter conditions at sea which include rough water and the affects effects of wind .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #29:1>
Therefore it is not only the hydrodynamic properties of the vessel but also the aerodynamic properties of the above water structure which should be covered in the design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #30:1>
Another general requirement for a vessel is that of course changing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #31:1>
The vessel should be able to be turned by means of the control system , usually in the form of a rudder , in such a way that there is control both of the rate of turn and of the spatial envelope occupied by the vessel in a turn .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #32:1>
As well as the general handling qualities of the vessel when in open water there are also the handling qualities required for the vessel when entering and manoeuvring within harbour and restricted waters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #33:1>
In recent years these characteristics have taken on more importance in the specification of ships ships ' handling qualities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #34:1>
There is both the general safety of the vessel itself and the ability of pilots to handle it when bringing it in to harbour .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #35:1>
In this very general terminology what we are seeking is to design a sound vessel with good easy course keeping , good control on the turn and responsive handling qualities in restricted waters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #36:1>
The greatest difficulty is in specifying what is meant by the term &lsquo; good &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #37:1>
Some vessels have requirements for special handling qualities either in the open sea or in restricted waters .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #38:1>
Such vessels include diving support , mine hunting and cable laying ships .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #39:1>
There are also a number of vessels , particularly ferries , which have to be able to manoeuvre rapidly in the harbours from which they operate which imposes special handling considerations ( figure 2 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #40:1>
For underwater vehicles there are the additional requirements for controlling in the vertical plane which may lead to specifications on controllability to ensure safety , particularly at high speed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #41:1>
Such specific requirements do have the advantage of quantification which the general characteristics lack .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #42:1>
The designer needs tools to be able to evaluate the performance of the vessel against such requirements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #43:1>
Although there is no reliable initial estimating method , several methods exist by which this subject can be addressed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #44:1>
3 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #45:1>
Free model tests
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #46:1>
The free manoeuvring model is a well-established technique used in most tank testing establishments to assess the control characteristics of new designs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #47:1>
A number of standard test manoeuvres have been established for models and these can also be conducted on the full-scale vessel on trials ( figure 3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #48:1>
For the most part , free model testing is conducted in either calm water basins or lakes though in some establishments it is possible to generate waves and consider the ships ship 's behaviour in various sea states .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #49:1>
It is more difficult to simulate the affects effects of wind and tide though there are some specialist facilities in which this is a possibility .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #50:1>
The testing of scale models remains the best way of confirming manoeuvring characteristics and stability in new designs .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #51:1>
In some ways it remains the only way of guaranteeing the performance of the vessel before sea trials , by which time it is too late to change .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #52:1>
In this sense , model testing is essentially the prototype testing for the design .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #53:1>
However , one of the problems with free model testing is that in general it must be confined to certain standard manoeuvres and cannot readily reproduce all possible manoeuvres that may be required of the vessel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #54:1>
In some instances it is possible to lay out the harbour or channel conditions in which the ship has to manoeuvre and test these at model scale but this increases the difficulty and the cost of such an approach to the solution of the problem .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #55:1>
It is difficult to analyse free model manoeuvres to provide information on other more complicated manoeuvres .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #56:1>
Hence little in the way of future prediction of behaviour can be accomplished .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #57:1>
The results of model tests also do not readily provide information on the effects of design changes .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #58:1>
Essentially it is necessary to test the model out as originally envisaged and if its performance is not considered adequate then change the configuration and retest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #59:1>
I would certainly advocate that , for any new design , scale model manoeuvring tests should be conducted .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #60:1>
However , it is difficult to prepare a model and conduct tests in time to influence the design which is probably already heavily committed and allows little scope other than minor changes to appendages .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #61:1>
All too frequently manoeuvring tests at model scale are scheduled late in the test programme .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #62:1>
There are distinct advantages in preparing a model for manoeuvring tests as early as possible in the design stage even if the details of the form are not finalized and may be modified by later tests .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #63:1>
Apart from direct information on the testing of a specific design , free model tests are a source of some information that might be used in the preliminary design phase .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #64:1>
However , there has been a relatively limited amount of reported testing and evaluation of models particularly in comparison with full-scale results .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #65:1>
The notable exceptions are the extensive tests on Esso Osaka and the early work on Series 60 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #66:1>
In the consideration of estimating methods , one of the essential assumptions in the use of free models is that the results can be scaled to the full-size vessel using dynamic scaling laws .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #67:1>
For the most part they ignore any viscous or Reynolds number effects on the behaviour of the vessel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #68:1>
Comparisons between the model results and full-scale tests of the same hull shape have confirmed that this very broad assumption is reasonable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #69:1>
However , there have been some examples particularly with very full form tanker hulls where such a correspondence between model and full-scale breaks down and if the model is of too small a scale then such effects may influence the results compared with the full-scale vessel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #70:1>
Although this is the experience of testing , it is very hard to see how most of the essential forces on a manoeuvring vessel can arise without the existence of viscous effects in the fluid .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #71:1>
Free model tests also indicate that the effects of small changes are not easily predictable .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #72:1>
The most consistent change that can be made is that of running trim .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #73:1>
Ships and models appear quite consistent in that trim by the bow reduces directional stability while trim by the stern increases stability .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #74:1>
Other changes in configuration are less predictable even qualitatively in their effects on control .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #75:1>
Quite large changes in stern area can have slight effect whereas in other tests relatively small changes showed dramatic changes ( figure 4 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #76:1>
From personal experience on submarine trials it was found that vessels of the same class exhibited measurably different control characteristics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #77:1>
The only rational explanation was that difference in hull geometry as built altered the hydrodynamic forces and moments generated on the hull .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #78:1>
If such second order geometric differences in hull shape do influence the control characteristics it may be very difficult to ever produce a reliable preliminary estimate method .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #79:1>
4 .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #80:1>
Constrained model tests
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #81:1>
Constrained testing of scale models is also a well-established technique used by many establishments to determine the relationship between imposed motions and the forces and moments acting on the model .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #82:1>
Standard tests consist of the oblique tow test in the ship tank or the more informative rotating arm tests in which the model is towed not only on the oblique path but on curved path at the same time ( figure 5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #83:1>
In some establishments use is made of the planar motion mechanism in which oscillatory motion is imposed on the model and the resultant oscillatory forces and moments relating to both acceleration and velocity can be determined .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #84:1>
There is the same implicit assumption in such tests that , providing the model is sufficiently large , Reynolds number affects effects are minimal .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #85:1>
A more important feature of the constrained model testing is that it does allow for the prediction of motions of vessels in other than standard manoeuvring tests and also provides the information necessary to design autocontrol systems for models and ships .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #86:1>
The simulation of manoeuvres usually calls for behaviour in various propulsion states which extends the testing requirements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #87:1>
The problems of the constrained model testing approach and subsequent simulation of performance is are similar to that of free manoeuvring tests .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #88:1>
It is the time required to build such models and test them related to the progress of the design programme .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #89:1>
To some extent , providing the facilities exist , it is quicker to introduce constrained model testing , as the model is relatively simple compared with the instrumented free model .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #90:1>
Most of constrained test instrumentation is incorporated in<l>to fixed facilities in test tanks &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #91:1>
however , these are expensive facilities .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #92:1>
Perhaps the greatest problem with this approach , is that , again , it provides very little direct information to the designer in way of understanding how he can configure a hull to achieve his objective .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #93:1>
Some attempts have been made in both free models and constrained models to identify design features by systematically changing the hull form or configuration .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #94:1>
Thus it is possible to test models with and without rudders , bilge keels , appendages , planes , stabilizers .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #95:1>
All of these indicate changes in manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel some marked and some not so marked .
<ICE-GB:W2A-039 #96:1>
It is very difficult to identify exactly the effect of an appendage as it is not simply the effect of the appendage itself but its interaction with the main body of the hull .

Part two provides a detailed description of the shutter drive and the dome drive that enables the shutter to follow the telescope automatically , and the telescope drives .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #5:1>
Over a six year interval I have been occupied with the design and in supervising the construction of a domed observatory and the reconstruction of a 250-mm f/10 Newtonian reflector .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #6:1>
The specific intention was to manufacture a telescope-observatory system , controll<l>able either at the eyepiece , or remotely .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #7:1>
The telescope would principally be employed for high resolution work &semi; i.e. lunar and planetary observation and double star astrometry .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #8:1>
The double star measures would be made using either a bifilar micrometer or a Lyot-Carmichel Spath Blade micrometer . 1,2

<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #13:1>
To employ a filar micrometer effectively , it must be carried on a very stiff mounting that has a large inertial moment and a very smooth and accurate drive .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #14:1>
The aberrations at the focal plane should be minimal , and the optics must be capable of yielding high contrast images at very high magnifications .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #15:1>
In his book , A Plea for Reflectors , 3 John Browning describes just such a telescope .

During the heyday of amateur double star observation in the latter quarter of the 19th century the instrument of choice was the long focus achromatic refractor .

Originally housed in the grounds of Eton College , it had fallen into a state of complete delapidation , and had been donated to Slough Astronomical Society in the mid 1960s .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #42:1>
The iron castings and the cast steel hour and declination axles were in sound condition and I considered its restoration a worthwhile challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #43:1>
Beforehand an observatory was needed , able to house the instrument once completed .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #44:1>
My initial ideas centred upon a 3.65-m ( 12-foot ) diameter dome con<l>structed of galvanised steel on a 25mm x 25mm x 6mm square channel framework , surmounting a 1.2-m ( 4-foot ) circular wall of concrete blocks .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #45:1>
Following discussions with the late Alan Young I subsequently modified the design to a 3.8-m ( 12ft 6in ) facetted monocoque dome on a 12-sided galvanised steel fabri<l>cated wall .

The wall and railtube form an integral assembly of twelve 50-mm SHS stanchions rawl bolted to the base upon which is bolted a mill rolled 47-mm CDS Sche<l>dule 10 tube , plugged and butt welded in five sections .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #58:1>
The wall cladding is 22 SWG ( 1.0-mm ) &lsquo; ZINTEC &rsquo; lined with &lsquo; DALER &rsquo; board .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #59:1>
The dome is made of 16 SWG ( 1.6-mm ) half hard aluminium , 42 sided , with 3 different facet shapes , each cut , return folded down the sides and joggled top and bottom , and rivetted together on a 50mm x 50mm x 6mm equal angle aluminium base polygon .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #60:1>
The shutter is 915 mm ( 36 inches ) wide and of the up-and-over variety .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #61:1>
Both were manufactured by Broadview Engi<l>neering in East Sussex .

The equivalent pressure distribution across a hemispherical roof in the vertical plane normal to the direction or lamina flow is obtained by the vectorial summation of Hutton 's Formula :
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #69:1>
The pier cap is surmounted with a slate bedplate into which socket cups are let .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #70:1>
Into these the bedplate spacers and levelling bolts rest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #71:1>
Altitude and meridional alignment are effected by differential screws .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #72:1>
The alti<l>tude differential screw constants are 412 and 37.2 arcsecs per rev .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #73:1>
The azimuth differential screw con<l>stants 247 and 27.5 arcsecs per rev .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #74:1>
By means of these fine adjustments the hour axis has been aligned to the true pole within 2.5 arcsecs using Vezin 's method . 11

The telescope tube assembly was rebuilt and the equatorial refurbished by H.N. Irving &ampersand; Son over a six-year period .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #78:1>
The tube is a 300mm ID x 16 SWG ( 1.6-mm ) rolled steel , lined with 6-mm dense cork , and supported in a rotating cradle .

The azimuth and the altitude ( not shown but identical ) alignment sockets are hour-glass shaped in order to spread the pressure of the levelling bolts through the slate and transfer the load directly to the pier cap .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #89:1>
The sole purpose of the bed plate is to locate the levelling bolts of the base plate ,
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #90:1>
it merely rests on the pier cap due to its enormous self weight and resists thermal creep and vibration induced movements .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #91:1>
Differential screws enable extremely fine adjustments without the drawback of very fine screw threads that would not withstand the force needed to move so massive an instrument .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #92:1>
The 90-mm aperture guide telescope has a swivel elbow that affords a comfortable viewing position at the projection reticle eyepeice eyepiece .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #93:1>
To minimise differential flexure it was constructed of 22 SWG ( 1.0-mm ) dural alloy and weighs only 33 N ( 7 1/2 lbsf. )
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #94:1>
The rackmount has a worm and wheel driven PA circle in German silver reading to 30 arcsecs by means of twin verniers , and the eyepiece adaptors have breach lock bayonet couplings .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #95:1>
The tube is fitted with adjustable radial weights .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #96:1>
The forward weight can be adjusted by means of a handle to a scale calibrated in ounce-inches .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #97:1>
The tube accessories and rackmount are so disposed with respect to the radial counterweights as to maintain the centre of gravity on the mechanical axis .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #98:1>
The hour/right ascension circle can be locked and driven .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #99:1>
It has an internal gear and pinion for setting .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #100:1>
It reads by means of verniers to 5s time .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #101:1>
The declination circle was re-engraved by O.H. Kampf 's of Wim<l>bourne Minister &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #102:1>
it reads by a repeating vernier to 1 ' arc .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #103:1>
There is a tangent arm half way along the hour axis that engages with a clutched wormwheel .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #104:1>
It was orig<l>inally the driving worm and wheel system , coupled to a falling weight clock drive , which was missing .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #105:1>
I utilize it to set the telescope in hour angle before engaging the synchronous drive , which is carried on an eccentric .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #106:1>
The primary mirror is of some historic interest .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #107:1>
It is diameter 260 mm by 60 mm thickness plate glass and was originally ground and polished by the Rev. Chas Tweedale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #108:1>
It was subsequently refigured by Calver in the early years of this century , and then by an unknown hand in the recent past as evinced by cerium oxide embedded around the edge .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #109:1>
I had it refigured by A.E. Optics .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #110:1>
The interesting feature of the mirror is the engraving on the back , which I assume must have been executed by Tweedale .
<ICE-GB:W2A-040 #111:1>
There is an inscription around the cir<l>cumference which reads , &lsquo; Thou Lord in the beginning hast created the earth and the heavens are the work of thine hands .

CHAPTER 8
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #2:1>
A Lone Voice
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #3:1>
Radio was , and still is , good to me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #4:1>
As an actor , I had appeared in innumerable schools broadcasts , in Saturday Night Theatre and in The Dales .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #5:1>
For seven years I had been broadcasting regularly on Monday morning from the archives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #6:1>
I had been made a &lsquo; regular &rsquo; by Brian Cook , who later became Controller of Radio City in Liverpool .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #7:1>
Of all my broadcasting , the Monday morning spot was perhaps the best fun .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #8:1>
Not only was there the pleasure of listening to old recordings and the great names of the past , but there was an opportunity to write almost anything one liked .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #9:1>
The programme had a biggish audience ( in radio terms ) because it followed the Today programme , and because people listened to it in their cars on the way to work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #10:1>
They either loved it or loathed it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #11:1>
I once had a fan letter from Neil Kinnock saying what a good way it was to start Monday morning and asking me how I got away with it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #12:1>
On the other hand , I got a letter from a regular BBC correspondent who said he always turned the radio off immediately if it was my turn on the programme , but he would like to take issue with something I had said last week ...
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #13:1>
It was a humorous programme , but to my astonishment sometimes also managed to be controversial .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #14:1>
Once , during the Falklands conflict , I had made a programme called Don't Mention The War .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #15:1>
Brian and I had felt there were so many programmes about the issue that we would eschew it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #16:1>
We made a programme out of twenty or so discs chosen entirely at random , and to our amazement every one of them contained something which could be taken as referring to the war .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #17:1>
Most relevant was a dramatized version , of how the news of the Battle of Trafalgar was brought to London .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #18:1>
In view of the furore over the transmission of news from the Falklands which was raging at the time , this proved especially pertinent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #19:1>
Needless to say , that week 's programme had a piece on the impossibility of avoiding any mention of the war .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #20:1>
But on the morning of transmission , Brian and I agreed that we should remove the broadcast from the schedules in deference to the relatives of those aboard HMS Sheffield , which had just been attacked .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #21:1>
On another occasion , I was doing a parody of the great Wynford Vaughan-Thomas in a programme called The Country<l>side In Winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #22:1>
Several people remarked on the authentic sound effects we had used , including the snow and the howling wind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #23:1>
Little did they know that it had been recorded under car head<l>lights on a cold winter 's night on a mountainside in Wales .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #24:1>
I had been filming The Paras at the time , and Brian had had to come down to Wales with the records .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #25:1>
I had written the script in my spare time , and we had had to record it some way away on the mountainside in order to find somewhere relatively quiet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #26:1>
My hands were so cold I dropped the script several times , but we eventually finished it and returned thankfully to base .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #27:1>
I had also , increasingly , made documentaries and features , from Birmingham , Bristol and from London , in addition to short features for Bookshelf and The Week 's Antiques and regularly deputising for Margaret Howard on Pick Of The Week .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #28:1>
I had been a panellist on Radio 2 's The Law Game and On The Air , and made A Good Read with Edna Healey , as well as guesting on The John Dunne Show , The Pete Murray Show , Start The Week and Around Midnight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #29:1>
I once ran from the Archive studio to the Start The Week studio , as a stunt , with just a two-minute news bulletin in between .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #30:1>
If television was going to be bloody-minded , radio would keep me busy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #31:1>
We listened to A Lone Voice , Sharon and I , with Caroline Millington , in her office .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #32:1>
I was not sure that I would be up to listening with a bigger crowd , and reflected that it was the first time in my professional life that I had actually wanted a small audience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #33:1>
I had already heard it , of course , at home with Jo and Ellie and , with no restraints , had broken down uncontrollably .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #34:1>
The programme was prepared in secret , in the winter of 1987-88 , mainly in Sharon 's flat which was off Goodge St , conveniently near Broadcasting House .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #35:1>
There were two reasons for the secrecy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #36:1>
First , I did not want to have to explain my illness over and over again and second , the purely professional one that the programme was the first of a new series , and we felt it would have more impact if it were kept as a surprise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #37:1>
We were fortunate in that the Peter Wright Spycatcher scandal was still occupying people 's minds , and it was assumed that we were making a programme about spies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #38:1>
At that time , my speech was good enough to pass muster in public so we had no worries on that score .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #39:1>
Nevertheless , I had spent some months wondering when , where , and how much to reveal to colleagues and the public .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #40:1>
My feelings about coming clean on the radio were mixed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #41:1>
On the one hand , it would be a relief to have it off my chest &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #42:1>
on the other , I felt that I would be committing professional hara kiri on air .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #43:1>
It would be a spec<l>tacular way to go , but go I must .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #44:1>
Or so I felt .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #45:1>
We began by recalling some moments from my recent radio broadcasts , and how I had been working away quite happily on the archive programme ( then produced by Helen Fry ) when I first began to notice a lack of balance - a trend not encouraged at the BBC .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #46:1>
I was not keen to start an industry out of my own illness , but I had agreed to keep my diary on broadcast-quality equipment in case we should need to use it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #47:1>
In the event , we used a good deal of it and I had to concede that Sharon 's judgement about making it a personal document was better than mine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #48:1>
I decided to keep the diary on tape , partly because I was a professional broadcaster and used to carrying around portable recording equipment , and partly because by then my ability to write by hand was so bad as to make it well-nigh impossible &semi; and added difficulties , such as stress or tiredness , or even alcohol , made it worse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #49:1>
Having to struggle to write the cheque after a visit to my local wine-bar was one of the ways I knew the disease was getting a grip .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #50:1>
There were the usual witty remarks about &lsquo; one too many &rsquo; , but the sad fact was that even then two was one too many , and perhaps even one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #51:1>
A glass of wine would make me incapable , but not drunk .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #52:1>
At the time of the broadcast in February 1988 , surrounded by pieces of tape and fragments of my recent life and conversations , it was embarrassing for someone who had so often reported on other people 's calamities , to be reporting on my own , but that was how I had chosen to do it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #53:1>
And not before time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #54:1>
I described how I first noticed the symptoms and how I first heard from the doctor that it was no ordinary problem .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #55:1>
Because I had been carrying the tape recorder with me , I was able to record the authentic sounds of the various technicians and therapists at work , when I went to the National Hospital for my check ups .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #56:1>
There were regular &lsquo; autonomic &rsquo; tests , where my blood pressure was checked in various postures &semi; body and brain were scanned and scoured &semi; blood , heart , muscle , nerves , strength and memory were tested , even my intelligence - and especially my patience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #57:1>
Also , my lungs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #58:1>
A tube was inserted into my mouth and I was required to blow over a count of ten .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #59:1>
The effort made an absurd noise , but I passed the test all right .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #60:1>
The disease had not got too firm a grip yet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #61:1>
Nevertheless , after nearly fifty years of healthy insouciance , climbing mountains and hanging from helicopters , I had got my come-uppance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #62:1>
I did not enjoy watching fellow patients go shak<l>ing , creeping and wheeling past my hospital bed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #63:1>
Was this the future ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #64:1>
I did not know then that they were suffering from a variety of diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #65:1>
I did not particularly enjoy hearing a Consult<l>ant Neurologist in London confirming that what I had first heard in Bristol , but had for so long pretended must be happening to someone else , was truly happening to me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #66:1>
Dr Anita Harding knows as much as anyone about how the cerebellum works .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #67:1>
Yet even she admits that little is known .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #68:1>
What was observable was that a &lsquo; premature death &rsquo; had occurred in my nervous system , chiefly confined to those parts which controlled balance and speech .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #69:1>
They call it cerebellar syndrome .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #70:1>
How many people have it is not known exactly , and I learnt that there was no specialist group funding or supporting re<l>search .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #71:1>
There was no known cause , and no cure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #72:1>
Hence there was very little in the way of treatment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #73:1>
&lsquo; But , &rsquo; said Dr Harding , &lsquo; I think there is slightly more than nothing we can do . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #74:1>
Hence the tests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #75:1>
Yet , with all this lack of knowledge , how could she be sure of an accurate diagnosis ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #76:1>
Her reply was confident .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #77:1>
She might not know the cause , but she could weigh up the symptoms and what she found when she examined me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #78:1>
Like the doctor in Bristol , she looked at my eyes , she got me to touch fingers and noses , to hop on one leg and saw how I coordinated - or did not coordinate - arms and legs by performing simple tests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #79:1>
I found myself , for example , with the occupational ther<l>apist , putting kidney beans into pots , and as a result of all these tests Dr Harding concluded that the &lsquo; story &rsquo; was right , that I had a degenerative disease which was getting worse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #80:1>
Sometimes , these so-called &lsquo; progressive &rsquo; diseases stopped for a while , but more often they developed at a uniform , slow pace .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #81:1>
So what was the end-product ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #82:1>
How would I end up ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #83:1>
&lsquo; Well , you are likely to find that your walking becomes more difficult , as you know it already has .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #84:1>
You are also likely to find that the clumsiness in your arms gets worse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #85:1>
( Carrying a cup of tea , for example , is an absolute disaster area . )
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #86:1>
You have to concentrate more - and that makes you more tired . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #87:1>
&lsquo; What 's the best and the worst that I can expect ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #88:1>
&lsquo; The best you can expect is that it will stay as it is .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #89:1>
The worst is that it will worsen slowly but to an extent , for example , that you could lose the ability to walk . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #90:1>
&lsquo; You mean a wheelchair ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #91:1>
&lsquo; Yes , that 's right . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #92:1>
A wheelchair might well be a problem for a television reporter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #93:1>
But not necessarily for radio .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #94:1>
After all , listeners need never know , or care , whether the person speaking to them had cerebel<l>lar disease .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #95:1>
If it were not for one thing more - the speech .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #96:1>
In A Lone Voice we gave an example of how a radio show was made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #97:1>
Just before Christmas , the producer of Going Places , Irene Mallis , had asked me to make a documentary on &lsquo; warm-up men &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #98:1>
I had explained my problem but , being a good friend , she had been prepared to do the extra work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #99:1>
The documentary had gone well and the interviews fine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #100:1>
Then we came to the record<l>ing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #101:1>
Here I stuttered and stumbled a good deal , and a lot of extra editing work was required .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #102:1>
The result was all right , but the process difficult .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #103:1>
In A Lone Voice , we used a recording of how that programme had been made to make clear to listeners what had been involved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #104:1>
Producers are used to consigning presenter 's fluffs to the waste-paper basket ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #105:1>
they cobble and contrive -
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #106:1>
all art is artifice after all but not on that scale .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #107:1>
A presenter with cerebellar ataxia is , as they say , &lsquo; a whole new ball game &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #108:1>
The voice deepens , becomes less flexible , cannot cope with consonants too close together .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #109:1>
Despite the patience of colleagues over the previous year , the condition had become harder and harder to disguise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #110:1>
And sometimes - let 's face it , the listeners are not daft - impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #111:1>
&lsquo; Is Glyn Worsnip unwell or something ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #112:1>
He doesn't sound his normal self . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #113:1>
&lsquo; What was wrong with Glyn Worsnip this evening ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #114:1>
His en<l>unciation was definitely slurred at times . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #115:1>
Those two calls to the BBC Duty Office cost me a favourite series , Stop Press &semi; but they forced me to face , at last , the prob<l>ability that my condition would eventually cost me my career .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #116:1>
Many , many have had to do the same .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #117:1>
To wonder whether , and when , to explain to workmates , how and whether to &lsquo; come clean &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #118:1>
The broadcast , a personal one - self-indulgent even - was my way of doing it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #119:1>
But I hope it spoke for many who have endured the loneliness and anxiety of facing up to a crippling disease .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #120:1>
In case I was tempted to gloss over certain thoughts , I decided to share the diary which had helped me admit to myself what I was now admitting to the listeners .
<ICE-GB:W2B-001 #121:1>
Here are some of those thoughts .

<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #6:1>
AT THE END OF AUGUST 1873 Vincent moved into new lodgings in Brixton , on the outskirts of London .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #7:1>
On his arrival , he compared his new room to the attic one he had known as a young boy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #8:1>
&lsquo; I now have a room such as I always longed for , without a slanting ceiling and without blue paper with a green border , &rsquo; he told Theo. 2
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #9:1>
A few weeks later Vincent made sket<l>ches of his new home for his parents .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #10:1>
&lsquo; Vincent sent us such a nice drawing of the street and the house where he lives and of the interior of his room so that we really can imagine how it looks , &rsquo; Father told Theo. 3 U2673
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #11:1>
It was here that the young Dutchman first fell in love .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #12:1>
Until recently , all that was known was what had been written by Vincent 's sister-in-law Jo in 1914 :
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #13:1>
&lsquo; He found a delightful home at Mrs Loyer 's .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #14:1>
She was the widow of a curate from the south of France &semi; with her daughter she kept a small day school and had a few paying guests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #15:1>
Vincent felt great sympathy for the mother , fell in love with the daughter Ursula [ sic ] , and spent a happy time with them , as the cheerful tone of his letters clearly shows .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #16:1>
But Ursula was already secretly engaged &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #17:1>
when he heard this , Vincent tried to persuade her to break the engagement , but he did not succeed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #18:1>
In July 1874 , he came home for the holidays in a melancholy , depressed mood .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #19:1>
From that time on there was a change in his character :
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #20:1>
he inclined more and more towards religious fanaticism and led a secluded life . &rsquo; 4 p. 7
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #21:1>
Jo 's account of these crucial events is frustratingly brief , and to add to the confusion , it turns out that she also gave the landlady 's daughter her mother 's name .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #22:1>
It was not until almost a century after Vincent fell in love that the real story about the Loyers began to emerge , thanks to the curiosity of a London postman .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #23:1>
Paul Chalcroft is an enthusiastic amateur artist who loves Vincent 's pictures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #24:1>
After his delivery rounds , he works in the kitchen of his Camberwell flat , painting copies from postcard reproductions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #25:1>
Nearly twenty years ago , Chalcroft became curious to know more about the artist he admired .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #26:1>
He was intrigued to learn that Vincent had spent his early years in London , but was disappointed to find that the whereabouts of the house where Vincent had fallen in love were unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #27:1>
In 1971 , during a long postal strike , the 46-year-old postman set out to solve the mystery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #28:1>
&lsquo; Vincent was twenty when he moved to the Loyers , so Ursula - for that was assumed to be the name of the daughter - must have been about the same age , or maybe a little younger , &rsquo; Chalcroft reasoned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #29:1>
He first went to the national birth registration records to check the entries for the 1850s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #30:1>
Fortunately Loyer is a very unusual name in London , and the only one listed was Eugenie , born on 10 April 1854 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #31:1>
This was the right period , since it would have made her just a year younger than Vincent , but it was the wrong Christian name .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #32:1>
Chalcroft studied the birth certificate , and found that her parents were Jean Baptiste Loyer , a professor of languages , and Sarah Ursula .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #33:1>
He thought that perhaps Jo had confused the name of mother and daughter when she wrote her account forty years afterwards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #34:1>
&lsquo; I tried to identify the previous lodger to whom the daughter had been secretly engaged , &rsquo; Chalcroft explained .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #35:1>
Checking marriage records , he found that Eugenie Loyer had married at St. Mary 's church , Lambeth , on 10 April 1878 , her twenty-fourth birthday .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #36:1>
Her husband was Samuel Plowman , an engi<l>neer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #37:1>
The address of both of them was given simply as Hack<l>ford Road , Brixton , with no street number .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #38:1>
Chalcroft went back to the birth records to see what had happened next .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #39:1>
The search did not take long , because Eugenie turned out to have been pregnant when they married .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #40:1>
Frank , their first child , was born just six months later , on 18 October 1878 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #41:1>
Curiously , the birth certificate showed that the baby was born at 87 Hackford Road , while the father was resident at number 17 in the same street .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #42:1>
Census records filled in the next piece of the puzzle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #43:1>
They are only opened after a century has elapsed , but fortunately Chalcroft did not have to wait .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #44:1>
On 2 January 1972 , he went to the Public Record Office to examine the returns for Hackford Road .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #45:1>
Listed at number 87 in 1871 was Sarah U. Loyer , a &lsquo; 46-year-old &rsquo; widow , and her sixteen-year-old daughter Eugenie ( there was a misunderstanding about Ursula 's age , because her death certificate suggests that she was actually 56 at the time of the 1871 census ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #46:1>
This was the final confirmation that Vincent must have lodged at 87 Hackford Road .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #47:1>
The mystery of number 17 remains unsolved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #48:1>
Samuel might have found accommodation there when he left the Loyers , and he would then have been just down the road while Vincent was wooing Eugenie .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #49:1>
Another possibility is that Samuel and his new wife moved there when they married , with Eugenie returning to her mother 's house to give birth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #50:1>
More likely , the &lsquo; 17 &rsquo; was simply a clerical error for &lsquo; 87 &rsquo; , because when the 1881 census was taken , Ursula , Eugenie and Samuel were all living together at number 87 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #51:1>
After Chalcroft had pinpointed the Loyers ' home , he visited Hackford Road and found that number 87 was still standing , a three-storey terraced house .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #52:1>
It must have been a comfortable home in a middle class area when Vincent arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #53:1>
Although the Georgian building was then already fifty years old , it was a large house for just the two Loyers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #54:1>
They must have used the ground floor for their small school , but there was still room to take in lodgers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #55:1>
The present residents of number 87 , Arthur and Marjorie Smith , were astonished when Chalcroft knocked on the door and told them of the illustrious tenant who had once stayed there .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #56:1>
The Smiths took the postman upstairs and showed him a small room on the top floor , facing the front .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #57:1>
&lsquo; When we moved in back in the 1950s , the family who were leaving said it was always known as The Lodger 's Room , &rsquo; Mrs Smith explained .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #58:2>
Representing the Parisian Suburbs
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #59:2>
Pissarro 's career between 1866 and 1872 was fragmented , due to a combination of external circum<l>stances and , it seems , a search for new locations to paint .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #60:2>
Based in Pontoise from early 1866 , he had moved to Louveciennes , in the western suburbs of Paris , by spring 1869 ( see map &semi; fig. 7 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #61:2>
However , at the beginning of September 1870 the Prussian advance on Paris forced him to evacuate his family to Montfoucault , from where they travelled on to London by the end of the year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #62:2>
They were back in Louveciennes by late 1871 , but only stayed nine months , set<l>tling back in Pontoise in August 1872 . 40
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #63:2>
We tend to think of Monet , Renoir and Sisley as the painters of the Parisian suburbs at this time , but Pissarro 's two short spells should not be overlooked .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #64:2>
Apart from a few earlier studies of pic<l>turesque parts of Montmartre , 41 the Louveciennes and Marly paintings of 1869-72 add up to Pissarro 's first con<l>certed efforts to represent aspects of city life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #65:2>
In the 1860s and 1870s the extension of the Parisian suburbs was rapid .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #66:2>
Villages to the west of the capital - such as Louveciennes and Voisins on the ridge overlooking the Seine , Bougival and Marly down by the river - had been gradually changing their identities since the arrival of the railways thirty years before .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #67:2>
Only a dozen kilometres from the centre of Paris and a few minutes by rail from the Gare Saint-Lazare , they pro<l>vided the metropolitan bourgeoisie with convenient and still quasi-rural accom<l>modation from which to commute and the day-tripper with riverside pastimes and promenades . 42
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #68:2>
The extent to which their populations were new and tran<l>sitory is apparent from the Saint-Lazare terminus 's passenger statistics for 1869 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #69:2>
of 13,250,000 passengers , suburban traf<l>fic comprised some 11 million . 43
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #70:2>
The old village communities still existed , but they were being swamped by the city 's overspill .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #71:2>
Painters had worked in the western suburbs for decades , among them artists such as C&eacute;lestin Nant Nanteuil , Fran&ccedille;ois Fran&ccedille;ais Fran√Åais Fran√Åais and Paul Huet &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #72:2>
Corot had property at nearby Ville d'Avaray , and painted at Marly in 1872 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #73:2>
Strolling round Bougival in 1855 , the Goncourt brothers joked how &lsquo; that 's been done by X , that 's been drawn by Y , Z painted that &rsquo; . 44
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #74:2>
For artists the attractions were evident .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #75:2>
The area provided a variety of motifs - river , hills and woods , pic<l>turesque villages and historic sites - with cheaper accommodation than Paris but still within easy distance for the city and the support systems it provided : dealers , critics , framers , collectors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #76:2>
However , by the late 1870s the essentially placid , escapist motifs which the elder genera<l>tion had sought , existed in shifting , threatened balance with the intrusion of the new : the riverside restaurant , the rau<l>cous bathing place , the crowded regattas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #77:2>
The younger landscapists were drawn to this precarious balance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #78:2>
Pissarro 's paintings made at Louve<l>ciennes , both before and after the Franco-Prussian War , tend to construct an image of rural village life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #79:2>
At least thirty take as their central motifs the roads linking these suburban villages with each other and nearby Versailles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #80:2>
View from Louveciennes ( fig. 8 ) , probably dat<l>ing from 1869 , 45 is a slow-paced and apparently agricultural image , with apple trees in blossom and carefully tended vines or soft-fruit bushes &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #81:2>
only the discreetly silhouetted Marly aqueduct gives any point of geographical reference .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #82:2>
Renoir painted the same road a few months later ( fig. 9 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #83:2>
His account of the motif further disguises the village of Voisins in the middle distance , makes the landscape appear more wild than cultivated , and all but effaces the aqueduct .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #84:2>
But whereas Pissarro 's figures are country people , Renoir juxtaposes his blue-clad peasant with a bourgeois family , giving us a fiction of a promen<l>ade in deep countryside .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #85:2>
A painting of about a decade earlier , Troyon 's Grape Harvest at Suiresnes ( fig. 10 ) , although taking a more distant , panoramic view and stressing the agricultural scene in the foreground , nevertheless showed the Marly aqueduct on the far left horizon and carefully lit the suburban agglomerations in the distant river valley , though these could easily be misread as country villages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #86:2>
Three painters of dif<l>ferent generations constructed images equivocal about the metropolis 's tenta<l>cular advance into agricultural land .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #87:2>
Returning to the area after the War , Pissaro largely retained the same fiction about Louveciennes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #88:2>
Both he and Sisley painted the rue de Voisins in Louvecien<l>nes in 1871 , Pissarro in the autumn and his colleague a little later , under snow ( figs 11 , 12 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #89:2>
The images differ in their effet , of course , and in their position .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #90:2>
But Sisley showed a newly tiled roof to the left , and specified more closely the types who populate his street : an aproned maid on the pavement , to the centre a baker carrying on his head a tray of bread , and behind him a bourgeois couple .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #91:2>
If Sisley was prepared to suggest renovation and class mixture , Pissarro selected a viewpoint that narrowed the street , a warm yet sombre tonality that implied age , and a staffage humbly dres<l>sed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #92:2>
One of the first Impressionist paint<l>ings to enter a British collection , Pissaro 's Rue de Voisins , Louveciennes was sold to a Lancashire industrialist , probably in 1872 . 46
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #93:2>
Perhaps its immedi<l>ate appeal was due to Pissarro 's success in contriving to represent increasingly suburbanized Louveciennes as change<l>less country village .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #94:2>
The Franco-Prussian War had a marked effect on Pissarro .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #95:2>
Despite his Danish citizenship , in November 1870 he was prepared to fight for the newly proclaimed Republic , but his mother urged him to put his family first . 47
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #96:2>
The worst blow fell in March 1871 , after the French surrender had raised the Prussian siege of Paris and post could reach Pissarro in London .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #97:2>
Julie 's sister , F&eacute;licie Estruc , reported that the Pissarros ' rented house in Louveciennes had been used as a stable and billet by the Prussians for four months and was unrecognizable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #98:2>
Pissarro had lost twenty years ' work &semi; he reckoned that over 1200 paintings , &eacute;tudes and drawings had disappeared or been destroyed . 48
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #99:2>
Louveciennes had been occupied throughout the siege by the Prussian V Army Corps .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #100:2>
From the heights to the west of Paris , their entrenchments offered a commanding view of the city and that flank 's lone outlying fort on Mont Val&eacute;rian Val√àrian , and there had been regular artillery engagements between the positions throughout the siege ( fig . 13 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #101:2>
King Wilhelm of Prussia even had a belvedere built on the end of the Marly aqueduct from which he could watch the bombardment of the French defences . 49
<ICE-GB:W2B-002 #102:2>
The devastation in Louveciennes that F&eacute;licie Estruc reported - &lsquo; the houses are burned &semi; windowpanes , shutters , doors , stairs , parapets , they 've all disappeared &rsquo; - was the combination of four months of Prussian investment and French return of fire .

<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #17:1>
Soaring was not the only aesthetic component of Gothic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #18:1>
There was another related element : the quest for light .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #19:1>
If Romanesque cathedrals were dark , this was not a deliberate search for sacred gloom &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #20:1>
on the contrary , their designers lit them as well as they could .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #21:1>
In the twelfth century , there was much cogitation on the subject of light .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #22:1>
The French mystic , Hugh of St Victor , believed there was a special divinity in light .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #23:1>
From this it was a short step to seeing a church as a theatre of the numinous .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #24:1>
Among Hugh 's admirers was Abbot Suger ( 1081-1151 ) , Abbot of the royal monastery of St Denis from 1122 and virtual ruler of France for two decades .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #25:1>
He objected strongly to the view of St Bernard and the early Cister<l>cians that decorative beauty in a church was an offence to God .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #26:1>
Though he did not theorize about Gothic he im<l>plemented it in his new church at St Denis and , when it was virtually complete , set his reasons down in his Libel<l>lus de consecratione Ecclesiae St Dionysii ( 1145 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #27:1>
The key to St Denis , the most influential building of its gener<l>ation , is the eastern arm , where the old Romanesque chevet of separate chapels is merged onto a double ambu<l>latory , so that nothing remains of the chapels save the curved outer wall and window , producing the maximum enlargement of the window surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #28:1>
Seen from the west , the chancel of the church glows with light from behind an illuminated forest of columns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #29:1>
The rays of light come from all directions and angles and , combined with the new slenderness which pure masonry made possible , make the columns appear to soar , as though weightless .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #30:1>
A new kind of aesthetic , the &lsquo; Gothic light &rsquo; , had been born .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #31:1>
There was , however , a further element in Gothic : the paramountcy of the moulding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #32:1>
The essence of a classic architecture - that is , one where the needful forms im<l>pose their discipline on the individual requirements of a particular building - is the quest for order .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #33:1>
The elements of a system of orders have utilitarian origins : a capital to distribute the support of a pillar more widely , a plinth to provide a damp-course , and so forth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #34:1>
But , once evolved , they exert their decorative power with great tenacity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #35:1>
The Gothic orders evolved from the arch , which is ac<l>tually built by setting the voussoirs of which it is com<l>posed on a temporary wooden centering , which is struck out after the arch has set .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #36:1>
As Romanesque developed , the roof of the structure was supported on piers but interior features were carried on the secondary support of columns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #37:1>
This created an inner order of supports , with the arches over them , such as the duplex bay which encloses two smaller ones at Durham .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #38:1>
Such features are called &lsquo; aedicular &rsquo; , that is &lsquo; miniature buildings &rsquo; , and the most common expression of the aedicular is the two-light window or bifora , with its tympanum set back behind the wall-face .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #39:1>
The earliest examples in England are the bifora windows in the transepts at Winchester .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #40:1>
Once an inner order had been developed , much centering could be saved , as each order acted as centering for the one over it , just as the development of the ribbed vaults saved center<l>ing for the shell between them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #41:1>
A perfectly logical de<l>velopment allowed the central baluster of the early two-light windows to develop into the colonette of mature Romanesque , with a quatrefoil in its tympanum , and so into the moulded mullion of Gothic , the quatrefoil expanding into a third light .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #42:1>
At the same time , the system of ordered moulding was developing its own artistic momentum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #43:1>
The moulding was utilitarian in origin but it was quickly adapted to con<l>ceal the crude structural realities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #44:1>
The basis of every moulding has been defined as the quirk , that is a groove cut into the stonework next to an angle , matched by another parallel quirk , the angle they form then being smoothed into a curve .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #45:1>
When the Gothic designer was faced with an aedicular feature in a blank wall , whether window , doorway , blank arch or niche , he immediately began to anchor it into the wall by a system of mouldings , which swept up one side and down the other .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #46:1>
Equally , the Romanesque support , whether compound pier or ordered arch , was invaded by the moulding system , which turned the pier into the typical Gothic clustered pillar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #47:1>
The support system and the aedicules were then bound together aesthetically , as they already were struc<l>turally , by a single ( if enormously complicated ) set of mouldings , so that flat surfaces virtually disappeared and each bay was a unified design .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #48:1>
In this respect , Gothic was an architectural system of detail , rather than a single con<l>structional or aesthetic principle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #49:1>
But whatever Gothic was , elements of it had begun to make their appearance in the later Norman churches .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #50:1>
They were a factor , albeit a very subordinate one , in the vast building programme launched by the Conqueror in the 1070s and continued under his two reigning sons .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #51:1>
At that point the French snatched the architectural leader<l>ship from the English , and the arrival of Gothic as a domi<l>nant force in England had to await the start of a second great wave of ecclesiastical building which began in the 1170s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #52:1>
This second wave was driven by two factors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #53:1>
The first was the growing dissatisfaction of the bishops and cath<l>edral clergy with &lsquo; their &rsquo; part of the existing Norman cath<l>edrals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #54:1>
As they had been built from east to west , the choirs had been finished first , often before the year 1100 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #55:1>
the naves , used by the congregation , were better built and more modern-looking , and as , in England , they were pushed to great lengths they made the clerical half of the church seem puny and insignificant at a time when cleri<l>calism was vigorously asserting its rights .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #56:1>
There was , then , a growing urge to rebuild the east ends .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #57:1>
The second factor was a new phase in the cult of relics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #58:1>
By the second half of the twelfth century , a period of rationalism and enlightenment , many of the old-style relic-collections had been discredited , and there was fierce competition for the authentic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #59:1>
Great men like Henry II and Frederick Bar<l>barossa engaged in complex diplomatic negotiations for a major relic such as the arm of St James .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #60:1>
The papacy became the supreme authenticating mechanism and in particular ruled out the creation of saints , except those who had been officially canonized by Rome .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #61:1>
The pos<l>session of the undoubted body of a saint , acknowledged as such by the papacy , became an enormously valuable asset to any church , for the growth of population and the taste for travel was turning the pilgrimage into a mass industry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #62:1>
In England , the new phase of the relic cult began with the canonization of Edward the Confessor ( whose remains were owned by Westminster Abbey ) in 1161 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #63:1>
At Canterbury , the sensational murder of Archbishop Becket in 1170 , followed by his canonization a mere two years later , gave the monks the elements of the most suc<l>cessful shrine in Europe , after that of St James at Com<l>postella , and St Peter 's in Rome itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #64:1>
The further accident of a fire at Canterbury in 1174 provided them with the pretext to transform the whole eastern arm into a grandiose approach to and setting for St Thomas 's body .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #65:1>
Westminster and Hailes Abbeys followed Canterbury in its apse-ambulatory plan as a relic-centre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #66:1>
At Winchester a new retrochoir was built for the relic-collection in 1202 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #67:1>
At Worcester the whole of the eastern part of the cath<l>edral was rebuilt from 1224 to accommodate the shrines of its patrons , St Oswald and St Wulfstan , the latter canonized in 1203 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #68:1>
Ely followed suit on behalf of St Ethel<l>dreda .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #69:1>
At Lincoln , its most famous bishop was canonized as St Hugh in 1220 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #70:1>
Rochester 's William of Perth fol<l>lowed in the 1250s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #71:1>
Desperate efforts were made by the chapter of Salisbury to get their prize possession , St Osmond , canonized .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #72:1>
In each of these cases , the relic became the justification for elaborate building or rebuilding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #73:1>
The Canterbury exercise was the first and , from the viewpoint of architectural history , by far the most im<l>portant .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #74:1>
Canterbury was the ecclesiastical centre of England , with a community of over a hundred monks throughout the twelfth century , as well as having the prestige of being England 's oldest see and the seat of the primacy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #75:1>
Kent had tended to have a separate culture his<l>tory from the rest of south-east England , and certainly Canterbury ( along with Rochester ) was the most exposed to direct French influence of all the cathedral cities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #76:1>
Lan<l>franc had pulled down the remains of the gutted Saxon cathedral immediately after his appointment in 1080 and had built what was then probably the largest church in England .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #77:1>
In the 1120s it was made even bigger by the replacement of Lanfranc 's east end by a more grandiose one , which included an eastern transept and two obliquely-set chapels of St Anselm and St Andrew .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #78:1>
The great fire of 1174 did not affect the nave , but it gutted the choir .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #79:1>
It seemed natural to the monks to turn to France , now the seat of architectural fashion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #80:1>
St Denis had been completed in 1144 , but it had already been superseded by the splendid new cathedral of St Etienne in Sens , the first true Gothic church which had been finished in 1168 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #81:1>
So one of its architects , William of Sens , was brought to Canterbury .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #82:1>
This is one of those rare occasions when we have a detailed literary authority to supplement the evidence of mute stones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #83:1>
The chronicler Gervase of Canterbury tells us that the fire started when a spark from a blaze nearby got between the lead covering of the roof and the wood joists .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #84:1>
William of Sens he described as &lsquo; a man of great abilities , and a most curious workman in wood and stone . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #85:1>
Apparently he had some difficulty in persuading the conservative English monks that the ruined choir must be pulled down completely , and even so they kept much of the wall and the eastern transepts with their Nor<l>man towers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #86:1>
Gervase continues :
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #87:1>
&lsquo; The two [ chapels ] of St Anselm and St Andrew , formerly placed in a circle on each side of the church , prevented the breadth of the choir from proceeding in a straight line .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #X88:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #X89:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #90:1>
William of Sens , in short , was obliged to adapt his scheme to con<l>form to the historical ideas and ceremonial usages of a tenaciously conservative community .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #91:1>
Once past the cha<l>pels , the building is widened again for the Trinity Chapel and for the so-called Corona , in which part of the crown or skull of St Thomas was kept .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #92:1>
The Frenchman began work in 1175 , but at the begin<l>ning of his fifth year , while preparing the centering for the choir vault , the scaffolding collapsed under him and he fell fifty feet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #93:1>
He was so badly hurt that he went back to France to die , appointing his English assistant , another William , as his successor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #94:1>
The work was completed in about 1200 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #95:1>
The choir at Canterbury is not outstanding as a work of art , but it is of exceptional historical interest , not only as the point at which England embraced the true Gothic style in an aesthetic sense , but as showing two dis<l>tinct handlings of the new mode .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #96:1>
The Frenchman built the choir arcades with a bold and consistent use of Corin<l>thian columns and pointed arches , and with an arcaded triforium again using the pointed arch ( though there are round double arches in the gallery ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #97:1>
The Englishman , who built the arches between the Trinity Chapel and the Corona , and the windows in the Corona itself , showed an extraordinary ambivalence in his use of rounded and pointed arches , and signalled his reluctance to abandon the Romanesque by a persistent use of archaic decorative motifs , which make a startling contrast to the fine natu<l>ralistic leaf-carving on the capitals of the Corinthian pil<l>lars designed by his French predecessor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #98:1>
Canterbury , indeed , is full of surprises for anyone who thinks of cathedrals in terms of typology .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #99:1>
Internally , it is no more than the sum of its parts , each of which is strongly individualistic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #100:1>
What gives it a kind of functional unity is its strong sense of theatre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #101:1>
Becket , himself a mas<l>ter of flamboyance and histrionics , was actually killed in the north-west transept , on a spot called the Martyrdom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #102:1>
His body was translated to a shrine immediately behind the high altar , close to a spectacular pavement of Alex<l>andrian mosaic brought back by crusaders , the pilgrim<l>age area being completed by the brilliantly-lit Corona .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #103:1>
The shrine was a staggering amalgam of gold , silver and jewels - including a giant ruby presented by St Louis of France - and when Henry VIII broke it up in the 1540s the loot filled twenty-seven carts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #104:1>
What added to the drama of approaching it was the fact that Canterbury , unlike nearly all other cathedrals , is deliberately built upon a series of four levels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #105:1>
The choir is placed sharply above the nave &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #106:1>
the presbytery and high altar are above the rest of the choir &semi; and the Trinity Chapel and Corona are higher still .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #107:1>
The final act of pilgrimage , then , was an ascent , in which throughout the summer season , the long files of pilgrims shuffled slowly forward , climbing as they went , until they came upon the sudden blazing glory of the sanctum lit by hundreds of candles , innumerable oil<l->lamps , and the filtered coloured lights of the tall Corona windows .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #108:1>
Here was liturgical drama to rival Compos<l>tella , and when Erasmus visited the shrine in the twilight of the Middle Ages , he was unable to prevent a certain note of wonder from creeping into his generally sceptical account .
<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #X109:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-003 #X110:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #1:1>
Anyone Know If It 's Raining in Rio ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #2:1>
To say actors are childlike is to pay them a compliment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #3:1>
When I think of children I think of imagination , generosity , and tantrums that are basically harmless .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #4:1>
Couple that with the ability to entertain , and I don't think you 've got a bad bunch but , just as children need parents , so actors would be lost without their agents .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #5:1>
They are the barrier between us and managements who make dastardly attempts to pay us miserable pittances so we can appear on some stage or film set and make them millionaires .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #6:1>
The ten per cent we pay our agent rewards him for settling the terms regarding billing , salary ( note the order in which an actor puts priorities ) and accommodation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #7:1>
He also deals with &lsquo; Does the artist get a car ? &rsquo; &lsquo; What about a stand-in ? &rsquo; and &lsquo; Surely just a few more lines in the second act wouldn't hurt . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #8:1>
All these matters are taken care of by our paterfamilias .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #9:1>
In some cases , as with my agent Dennis Selinger , they are also obliged to play the part of best man , godfather to the children , and lifelong friend .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #10:1>
Dennis was also Peter 's agent for some twenty-five years and performed the same kind of functions for him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #11:1>
Dealt with the deals , checked out the scripts , became a close friend and , as often as not , stayed up half the night listening to his troubles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #12:1>
He also did a couple of things for Peter which weren't really covered by his ten per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #13:1>
He introduced him to two of his wives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #14:1>
The first one , Anne Hayes , and the last one , Lynne Frederick .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #15:1>
Dennis introduced Anne to Peter at a dinner party in 1951 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #16:1>
He introduced Lynne to Peter at another dinner party , twenty-five years later , in 1976 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #17:1>
Lynne was just twenty-one when Peter saw her and it was obviously a &lsquo; Some Enchanted Evening &rsquo; moment Enchanted Evening √≠ moment for him , even though he had Titti Wachtmeister with him at the time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #18:1>
At 5 am the next morning , wilful as ever , he woke Dennis up with a phone call desperate to get Lynne 's number .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #19:1>
With the skill of many years of negotiation behind him , Dennis stalled long enough to pass a message to Lynne , giving her the option to call Pete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #20:1>
Later that day she did and the rest , as they say , was history .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #21:1>
The eagerly awaited gala premi&egrave;re premi√ãre of The Pink Panther Strikes Again , at the end of 1976 , made the front pages twice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #22:1>
The Odeon , Leicester Square , was the venue , and there were big headlines when it was announced that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales would be attending .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #23:1>
A few days later there were even bigger headlines when it was announced that Peter Sellers wouldn't .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #24:1>
The tabloids had a field day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #25:1>
The customary line-up of the artists concerned with the film had been organized , and the Royal walk down the line was all set to take place .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #26:1>
The public had always adored the opportunity of seeing the courtly bow of their matin&eacute;e idols , and watching the glamorous actresses vie with each other as to their depth of curtsy ( the blaze of flash guns as each lady film star dipped low becoming brighter in ratio to the cleavage shown ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #27:1>
However , Peter , running true to form , would have none of it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #28:1>
The Establishment that still enforced the rule that divorced personages were not welcome in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot felt the line-up at the premi&egrave;re should not include Lynne , as she and Peter were not yet married .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #29:1>
Furious , Peter assured all and sundry that , Prince Charles or no Prince Charles , he would boycott the premi&egrave;re .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #30:1>
Not only that , he 'd never play Clouseau again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #31:1>
Well , that bit wasn't true , but he certainly didn't go to the premi&egrave;re .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #32:1>
Prince Charles duly walked down the line , shook hands with who was there , and then , showing a rather splendid sense of humour said , &lsquo; You know , I could have commanded him to be here tonight . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #33:1>
Early in February of 1977 Pete came to our house and brought Lynne with him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #34:1>
All the latest dark-room equip<l>ment had to be demonstrated , the newest set of transparen<l>cies projected , there was the usual enquiry about the state of the vacuum cleaner and , last , but not least , Hospy had to be brought out and admired .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #35:1>
This large , furry , purple toy elephant had been given to Christopher , my eldest son , when he was aged six , by Peter 's mother Peg .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #36:1>
Without fail , on every visit , Pete took it in his arms , gave it a cuddle , ruffled its fur , then passed it back again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #37:1>
Finally , into the garage to inspect Dr Funk of Tahiti who was hibernating in a box of straw .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #38:1>
The baby tortoise , so tiny when Pete christened him on the docks at Southampton , was now the size of a large soup plate which , considering how many of our plants he 'd devoured over the years , was hardly surprising .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #39:1>
We 'd tried growing a few vegetables , well fenced off , but when we discovered Dr Funk had the climbing ability of Sherpa Tensing , we gave up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #40:1>
Lynne gave every impression of being just as enthusiastic as Pete , and there was a sense of fun , reminiscent of the times we 'd had with Anne , and I had the feeling Peter deliberately brought Lynne to the house as if he wanted the nod of approval .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #41:1>
We were trying out a new Polaroid camera in the lounge when my youngest son Timothy burst in on us .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #42:1>
Seven years old , the original little blond page boy , he was adored by every woman that set eyes on him and Lynne was no exception .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #43:1>
&lsquo; Ah , &rsquo; she said and looked at me with her huge dark eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #44:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #45:1>
The only trouble is ... &rsquo; her look now enveloped Peter as well , &lsquo; his children have turned out so badly . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #46:1>
As I had known Michael , Sarah and Victoria from their childhood , and naturally held them in deep affection , this remark came as rather a shock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #47:1>
Also , on reflection , I was baffled by the logic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #48:1>
I always presumed the child a man has by one woman must be temperamentally different from one he has by another woman .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #49:1>
However , one had to make allowances for youth , as Lynne was actually younger than one of the children she was talking about .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #50:1>
The remark certainly didn't seem to bother Pete , as a week later , in Paris , he and Lynne were married .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #51:1>
In what must have been record time , Blake had The Revenge of the Pink Panther on the stocks , and Pete was the first to break the news that I would be playing Dr Auguste Balls , costumier extraordinaire , and brains behind the many disguises that Clouseau wore .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #52:1>
I then read the script , and called Pete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #53:1>
&lsquo; Blake Edwards is a sadist , &rsquo; I said .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #54:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #X55:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #56:1>
Dr Auguste Balls , according to the script , was of mid<l->European extraction , very excitable , a crawler of repute , and obviously a con man of considerable quality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #57:1>
He was also an idiot .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #58:1>
When working on any new character I shared a trick of the trade with Peter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #59:1>
Get the voice right first .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #60:1>
This was an obvious hark-back to our radio days and , as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , you invariably based it on someone you held in esteem .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #61:1>
I 'd always been a great fan of Akim Tamiroff .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #62:1>
From his first appearance , back in the early thirties , in The General Died at Dawn , Tamiroff was the consummate character actor and could play anything from the sullen partisan in For Whom the Bell Tolls to outrageous comedy parts in dozens of Paramount pictures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #63:1>
The voice I chose was based on his .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #64:1>
After the usual discussion with Blake about make-up , we decided a small wig would be worn by Dr Balls , plus a moustache .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #65:1>
In January of 1978 I went to Shepperton Studios to meet Harry Frampton , once more in charge of make-up , to have a wig fitting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #66:1>
Well , I didn't get to meet Harry , or fit the wig , but I did lunch with Blake , which altered the next four weeks of my life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #67:1>
Arriving just before lunch , I looked for Harry Frampton in the dining room but he wasn't around .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #68:1>
Blake and Peter were .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #69:1>
&lsquo; Why , &rsquo; asked Blake , &lsquo; are you here ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #70:1>
Direct questions require direct answers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #71:1>
&lsquo; I have come for a wig fitting , &rsquo; I replied , &lsquo; as I shall be playing Dr Balls next Tuesday . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #72:1>
Blake gave a polite smile .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #73:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #74:1>
We - &rsquo; he indicated Peter and himself - &lsquo; will be in Hong Kong . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #75:1>
There was a slight pause , then I said , &lsquo; I see &rsquo; and lapsed into silence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #76:1>
Well , there really wasn't a lot more for me to say .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #77:1>
Blake then explained they 'd altered the schedule and were flying to Hong Kong earlier than expected as , for script purposes , they had to shoot there during the Chinese New Year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #78:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #X79:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #80:1>
he appeared to look halfway between Peter and me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #81:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #82:1>
As Peter gave a nod and said , &lsquo; Great idea , &rsquo; I naturally presumed the remark was made to him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #83:1>
But in fact Blake was talking to me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #84:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #85:1>
then waved to Derek Kavanagh , the production manager .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #86:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #87:1>
that was how I flew , with the rest of the unit , to Hong Kong for three and a half wonderful weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #88:1>
Hung Hoy Fa Choy is the Chinese for Happy New Year , and it seemed to be plastered on every building in Hong Kong .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #89:1>
The plane came down at night time on the narrow strip that juts across the bay , and the sea of lights below us made it look as if every firefly in the world had decided to migrate , and settle in the same place .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #90:1>
It was breathtaking .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #91:1>
With thoughts of rejoining mainland China far ahead , Hong Kong had hit its height as the business centre of the East , and was bursting with energy and life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #92:1>
The hotels were fabulous .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #93:1>
I was at the Excelsior and my room balcony not only overlooked one of the most spectacular bays in the world but , some fifteen storeys down , precisely below me , was the famous noonday gun immortalized by No&eumlaut;l Coward .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #94:1>
Thump , it went , every day at twelve noon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #95:1>
Peter and Lynne were staying at the Peninsula Hotel , architecturally of the old colonial style , which boasted a fleet of black-and-white Rolls-Royces , permanently available for transporting their clientele .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #96:1>
Hong Kong had obviously been very carefully planned with Peter and myself in mind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #97:1>
Apparently the entire camera output of Japan for the past several years was piled high in half the shop windows of the city , the other half were full of watches .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #98:1>
But we very nearly didn't get to see anything .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #99:1>
The morning after our arrival we grouped in the foyer and gazed out through the windows at a rain storm that made a monsoon look like a dripping tap .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #100:1>
Blake 's eyes narrowed as he looked at the Chinese production manager .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #101:1>

Chinese etiquette demands that you do a lot of bowing , especially if you 've got to impart bad news .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #103:1>
The production manager 's head started going up and down like a nodding dog on a rear car shelf .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #104:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #106:1>
he gave several more bows .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #107:1>
Blake then came out with one of the great lines ( as far as I 'm concerned ) of the century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #108:1>
He looked slowly round at the crew and said , &lsquo; Anyone know if it 's raining in Rio ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #109:1>
Without a pause someone said , &lsquo; I 'll find out &rsquo; , and dis<l>appeared .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #110:1>
For the next hour cables flew to and from Hollywood while the cast and crew sat around the foyer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #111:1>
We were advised to have our luggage ready as it was quite possible we might be flying on to Rio de Janeiro .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #112:1>
Then , as suddenly as it had poured down , the deluge ceased , the sun shone , the crew stopped joking about the girls from Ipanema , and we were set to film in Hong Kong .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #113:1>
Pete and I were all ready to raid those camera shops .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #114:1>
Within a few days we had our chance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #115:1>
We pressed endless camera releases , we inspected ranges of lenses we never even knew existed , and gradually became laden down with glossy brochure after glossy brochure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #116:1>
Pete was always a Leica enthusiast and in the Leitz showroom he was having a marvellous time trying out all their latest equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #117:1>
That was when I first noticed the trembling fingers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #118:1>
Peter 's illness , all those years ago , had receded so far back in time I never really thought of it any more .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #119:1>
He always had a fetish about showing any signs of physical weakness , and if he ever was a bit off colour he assured you it was &lsquo; Just a touch of the lurgi . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #120:1>
The lurgi was a Goon Show word that covered all sorts of ailments , ranging from the dreaded Montezuma 's Revenge , to creeping alopecia of the upper lip , and served as a comic assurance that there was really nothing to worry about .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #121:1>
I 'd have liked not to have worried about the trembling fingers , but I was suddenly overwhelmed with a terrible feeling of sadness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #122:1>
I quickly looked away , knowing that he was trying to hide the shaking .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #123:1>
We walked back to the hotel still gazing into almost every shop window .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #124:1>
A dazzling display of electronic watches caught our eye , every face a mass of liquid crystal figures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #125:1>
I looked at Pete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #126:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-004 #127:1>
He gave a couple of his Hmmns and off we went .

She has also worked as a switchboard operator for the American Bell Telephone Company , and as an instructor in creative writing at Cherry Lawn School , Darien , Connecti<l>cut , from 1969 to 1970 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #5:1>
Critical Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #6:1>
Dorothy Gilman 's central character is Mrs Emily Pollifax , described as &ldquo; a bored and lonely widow in her sixties &rdquo; who applies to the CIA for a job and is chosen as &ldquo; the least-suspectable person &rdquo; they can use for important assignments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #7:1>
Mrs Pollifax 's various adventures take place in romantic locales such as Turkey , where she is sent to help a double-agent escape &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #8:1>
in another story she is sent on a simple courier assignment , but is then kidnapped to Albania .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #9:1>
Mrs Pollifax is a colourful figure and often acts as a female detective in her assignments for the CIA .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #10:1>
However , she is one of the few females in spy fiction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #11:1>
Anthony Boucher of the New York Times Book Review commented : &ldquo; Mrs Gilman steers an adroit course between comedy and melodrama , which should delight you whether you 're looking for smiles , or thrills . &rdquo;

Biography
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #20:1>
Nik Gowing was educated at the University of Bristol ( 1970-73 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #21:1>
After he left university he started a career in journalism and worked for the Newcastle Chronicle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #22:1>
From 1974 to 1978 he worked for Granada Television in Manchester .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #23:1>
Since 1978 he has worked as an ITN correspondent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #24:1>
He is at present Foreign Affairs correspondent for &ldquo; Channel Four News &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #25:1>
From 1980 to 1983 he was ITN 's Eastern European correspondent based in Poland .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #26:1>
His smuggled report of the imposition of martial law in December 1981 was an international scoop .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #27:1>
He collected the 1982 BAFTA award for &ldquo; Best Actuality &rdquo; news coverage Best Actuality √Æ news coverage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #28:1>
Critical Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #29:1>
The action in The Wire occurs within a secret power struggle being waged inside the Kremlin between the ailing President Brezhnev and the ambitious head of the KGB , Yuri Andropov , who hatches a plot which will bring down Brezhnev by the assassination of General Jaruzelski , and implicate the CIA in his murder .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #30:1>
Most of the action takes place in Warsaw , Washington and Moscow , and the story traces the paths of Bogdan , a dedicated Solidarity activist , and Sulecki , a ruthless KGB &ldquo; sleeper &rdquo; who has been planted inside the union to discredit Solidarity and the American government by assassinating the Polish leader .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #31:1>
This novel is a work of fiction based on eye-witness reports and the personal experiences of Solidarity activists .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #32:1>
Gowing was the Eastern European correspon<l>dent for ITN for three years , in the midst of Solidarity 's highest and lowest moments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #33:1>
The story was inspired by a tip-off from an officer of the SB ( the Polish secret police , which had been harassing Gowing for a few months ) , that Soviet hardliners , backed by the KGB , were trying to depose General Jaruzelski .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #34:1>
Gowing made further enquiries to try to find out more , but he could not confirm the story .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #35:1>
Instead he decided to write a novel based upon this incident and using his knowledge of political events in Poland to make his story authentic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #36:1>
This is a rather long book :
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #37:1>
some of the characters are weak , and the dialogue is heavy at times .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #38:1>
However , Gowing gives us a vivid picture of Poland and its people , especially on the night that martial law is imposed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #39:1>
The author also conveys the strong feeling of nationalism , so much so that Jaruzelski , although Moscow-trained , tried to remain faithful to the Polish people , even though this attitude made him unpopular with both the Russians and the Poles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #40:1>
The book is interspersed with insights into the profession of journalism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #41:1>
For instance one of the characters voices this fact :
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #42:1>
The author is obviously speaking from experience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #43:1>
Gowing says that he enjoys spy fiction and &ldquo; it is a way to portray stories &rdquo; and also , &ldquo; I cannot easily report in my job at ITN ( where I am a diplomatic correspon<l>dent ) . &rdquo;

<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #55:1>
Critical Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #56:1>
Six Days of the Condor was published in 1974 and is the story of a CIA researcher ( employed by an obscure but real branch of the agency ) who returns from lunch to discover that all his colleagues have been murdered in his absence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #57:1>
From that moment on Ronald Malcolm , code-named Condor , is on the run trying to escape the agency and the hired killers determined to find him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #58:1>
His job in the agency is to read and analyse spy and mystery stories as they are published in order to spot anything that comes close to reality , and so detect possible leaks of information .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #59:1>
This novel was followed by Shadow of the Condor in which Ronald Malcolm reappears and was hailed by one critic as &ldquo; the most likeable and unlikely ClA agent on record &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #60:1>
In this story the body of an Air Force undercover agent based in Europe mysteriously turns up at a Montana missile site .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #61:1>
The CIA 's job is to find out what led the agent there and who killed him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #62:1>
To divert attention from the agency Malcolm is sent to Montana in disguise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #63:1>
He discovers that all parties are being double-crossed , even by the unusual standards of the world of international intrigue .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #64:1>
Grady says &ldquo; I was attracted to the espionage genre primarily because I knew something about it , because those types of stories are entertaining , and , when told properly , contain all the elements of good stories .

Biography
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #86:1>
An award-winning novelist and reporter , Bill Granger was raised in a working<l->class neighbourhood on the South Side of Chicago .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #87:1>
He began his career in 1963 when , while still in college , he joined the staff of United Press International .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #88:1>
He later worked for the Chicago Tribune , writing about crime , the police and politics , and covering such events as the race riots of the late 1960s and the 1968 Democratic Convention .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #89:1>
In 1969 he joined the staff of the Chicago Sun-Times , where he won an Associated Press award for his story of a participant in the My Lai massacre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #90:1>
He also wrote a series of stories on Northern Ireland for Newsday .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #91:1>
By 1978 Granger had contributed articles to Time , The New Republic and other magazines &semi; and became a daily columnist , television critic and teacher of journalism at Columbia College in Chicago .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #92:1>
Critical Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #93:1>
Granger began his literary career in 1978 with The November Man , which introduced the cool American spy who later appeared in a whole series of books .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #94:1>
His second novel , Public Murders ( 1980 ) , a Chicago police procedural , won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1981 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #95:1>
Altogether Granger has published seven &ldquo; November Man &rdquo; novels Man √Æ novels Man √Æ novels , four &ldquo; Chi<l>cago &rdquo; police mysteries √Æ police mysteries , two non-fiction books written with his wife , and three novels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #96:1>
His books have been translated into ten languages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #97:1>
Granger 's hero , introduced in The November Man , is a middle-aged spy named Devereaux , who works for a shadowy organisation called R Section .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #98:1>
This depart<l>ment was formed by John F Kennedy after the events at the Bay of Pigs when he decided that it was time to provide an independent watchdog over intelligence -
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #99:1>
so R Section was formed , hidden in the Department of Agriculture .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #100:1>
In his first novel , The November Man , Devereaux investigates an IRA plot to kill one of England 's most powerful men , Lord Slough .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #101:1>
The plot is complicated by the involvement of a Russian agent and CIA treachery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #102:1>
This novel gained national publicity when the IRA assassinated Lord Louis Mountbatten by planting a bomb on his boat on 27 August 1979 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #103:1>
What horrified everyone was that the fictional plot was so close to predicting the motives and methods the IRA actually used in the assassination of Mountbatten .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #104:1>
Even though the book was finished by 1978 , it was published two weeks before his murder .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #105:1>
Granger wrote an afterword to this novel in 1986 in which he said : &ldquo; That event [ Mountbatten 's assassination ] was to make this book an infamous reminder that realistic fiction - if it is to be any good at all - is merely a clear mirror vision of what is really happening in the world described .

In his fourth adventure , The British Cross , the November Man finds himself in frozen Helsinki .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #110:1>
He is waiting for a potential Russian defector to deliver informa<l>tion which should justify the risks of his defection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #111:1>
Eventually he gets a name : Tomas Crohan .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #112:1>
But nobody knows who he is , or if they do they are keeping it to themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #113:1>
When Devereaux passes on this name it sends the CIA , the KGB and the British Secret Service into an international conspiracy of silence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #114:1>
Devereaux receives orders to forget the defection and the name , which only fuels his curiosity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #115:1>
His investigation leads him to team up with Rita Macklin , a journalist , who has appeared in the series before , and the trail leads them from Helsinki , to Washington DC , Ireland , Britain and eventually to a psychiatric hospital in Leningrad .

Biography
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #133:1>
Graham Greene was educated at Berkhamsted School , where from all accounts he was on the point of running away on more than one occasion !
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #134:1>
He went on to Balliol College , Oxford , before starting a career in journalism in Nottingham .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #135:1>
In 1926 he joined The Times as a sub-editor and it was during this period that his first book was published , Babbling Brook ( 1925 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #136:1>
In 1930 he became literary editor of The Spectator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #137:1>
Stamboul Train ( 1932 ) and Brighton Rock ( 1938 ) helped to make him a popular novelist as well as one of the most consistent and powerful novelists emerging in England over the past fifty years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #138:1>
Critical Analysis
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #139:1>
It was not until shortly before the war that Greene introduces an element of the spy story into his work , most notably in The Confidential Agent , in which he introduced &ldquo; D &rdquo; , the agent of an imaginary Latin government which bore a distinct resem<l>blance to that of the embattled Spanish Republican Government of that era .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #140:1>
Greene is not , of course , to be labelled as a spy novelist , but he has used the often interwoven themes of espionage and corruption as a vehicle of his prose .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #141:1>
Undoubtedly Greene 's wartime service in Intelligence provided him with much material for his later spy books , not to mention some of the characters in them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #142:1>
His entry in Who 's Who states that from 1941 to 1944 he was in a &ldquo; department of the Foreign Office &rdquo; , which is a well-known euphemism for intelligence work , in Greene 's case mainly West Africa .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #143:1>
One of his main jobs was to watch the activities of the Vichy French in Freetown .
<ICE-GB:W2B-005 #144:1>
It is noteworthy that the section in which Greene worked was that of the Iberian sub-section of Section V of the SIS , which was controlled by none other than Kim Philby .

Chapter 4
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #16:1>
IT was impossible to say for how long John Dickens might be incarcerated &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #17:1>
so , in other words , it was impossible for his son to know the length of his service in the blacking factory .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #18:1>
But that John Dickens , unlike William Dorrit , did not intend to settle in the gaol is obvious from the fact that , very soon after his arrival in the Mar<l>shalsea , he was preparing for his freedom under the Insolvent Debtors Act .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #19:1>
This meant that he could be released after being declared insol<l>vent , if he could demonstrate that his debts were incurred uninten<l>tionally , that all property of his own was surrendered , and that all goods over a combined value of twenty pounds would be used to pay off his debtors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #20:1>
He had been left four hundred and fifty pounds in his mother 's will but , since the will was proved only after his release , it was not of much immediate material benefit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #21:1>
But it is noteworthy that his brother , William , swiftly paid off the original debt to James Karr which had begun the process of imprisonment in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #22:1>
( It is interesting to remember , in this connection , how important a part wills and legacies play in Charles Dickens 's fiction &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #23:1>
they represent a staple plot in use from Oliver Twist to Our Mutual Friend , and although they were also a characteristic of nineteenth-century fiction , a way of handling the twin themes of money and intrigue , they seem also deeply implicated in the processes of Dickens 's imagination .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #24:1>
A legacy , in his world , can often free you from unmerited suffering . )

The legal process of the Insolvent Debtors Act now had to go on until its end :
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #26:1>
in order properly to evaluate the worth of John Dickens 's belongings , his son had to appear before an official appraiser in order to have his own clothes valued .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #27:1>
So he arrived in his white hat , small jacket and corduroy trousers
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #28:1>
and , on being told by a gentleman smelling of beer that &ldquo; that would do &rdquo; and &ldquo; it was all right &rdquo; , he gave a bow and left the room .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #29:1>
The habit of bowing was far more customary then than now &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #30:1>
and we must imagine the young Dickens bowing in acknowledge<l>ment of an adult , bowing to his schoolmaster , bowing on receiving a favour of some kind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #31:1>
In such a simple act it is possible to glimpse far more clearly than in any number of statistics the pressure of a highly defined and stratified society , literally forcing the young boy down into a position of deference .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #32:1>
John Dickens 's case was brought before the Insolvent Court , described later by Dickens in The Pickwick Papers as a badly lit and badly ventilated room which was &ldquo; ... always full .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #33:1>
The steams of beer and spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling , and , being condensed by the heat , roll down the walls like rain :
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #34:1>
there are more old suits of clothes in it at one time , than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a twelve-month &semi; and more unwashed skins and grizzly beards ... &rdquo; and so forth , all the stench and noise of the place being recaptured in what reads like an act of memory on his part .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #35:1>
Here his father was placed in an enclosure to the left of a panel of judges ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #36:1>
his case reviewed ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #37:1>
debts both in Rochester and in London detailed ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #38:1>
and an appointee assigned to handle the payment of these (
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #39:1>
in fact John Dickens had to find a considerable sum in the November of the next year , and a further sum in the following November ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #40:1>
Case over .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #41:1>
And so , on 28 May , having spent fourteen weeks in the Marshalsea , John Dickens was released into the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #42:1>
If he was not taken in procession to the prison gates , as happens both to Samuel Pickwick and to William Dorrit , the relief and celebration must nevertheless have been much the same .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #43:1>
At first the whole Dickens family , with the exception of Fanny , who was still at the Royal Academy of Music , went to stay with Mrs Roylance in Little College Street &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #44:1>
the orphan servant seems to have been discharged at the same time ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #45:1>
one further example of the severity of behaviour in a period when people had to struggle for mere survival .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #46:1>
They came &ldquo; not as lodgers &rdquo; , Mrs Roylance 's grand<l>daughter later explained , &ldquo; but as welcome guests &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #47:1>
It is not clear how long they stayed here -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #48:1>
and who indeed would have bothered to record the wanderings of a poor family ? -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #49:1>
but at some point they moved further north , to Hampstead , remaining there until late in December .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #50:1>
Then at the end of this year the Dickens family moved to 29 Johnson Street , in Somers Town , only a few minutes ' walk from their original house in Bayham Street &semi; in an area which soon declined into squalor but was then what might be called &ldquo; shabby genteel &rdquo; , the home of shopkeepers and clerks .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #51:1>
The street was some thirty years old , and overlooked the fields which still bordered Camden Town &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #52:1>
it was narrow and had a sort of intimacy -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #53:1>
a &ldquo; family circle &rdquo; was the way in which it has been described -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #54:1>
but it could not have been entirely unaffected by the closeness of the city .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #55:1>
For one thing no gas light had as yet reached it
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #56:1>
and , since most of the inhabitants would have been too poor to afford an inexhaustible supply of oil-lighting , the street would have been plunged into profound darkness at the end of the day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #57:1>
The house itself was relatively small - &ldquo; a charming little villa &rdquo; was one description of it before it was demolished in 1934 - with a red brick facade , a small door with an arched fanlight , a narrow passage running the whole length of the house , and two floors with two rooms on each floor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #58:1>
There was a small garden at the back , with an &lsquo; outhouse &rsquo; used for multifarious purposes , and there was a high garden wall broken in places to allow for the passage of air .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #59:1>
Dickens 's own room seems to have been once again an attic or garret just beneath the sloping roof of the house &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #60:1>
he had at this , or a slightly later , stage his own library of books ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #61:1>
and there was a small &ldquo; basket grate &rdquo; to keep him warm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #62:1>
From his window the young boy would have looked across the green fields to Camden Town , and to the Hampstead Road along which the old stage coaches still travelled .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #63:1>
It was the road which carried Tom Jones and Partridge from St Albans , it was the road upon which Defoe 's Captain Jack had made his way :
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #64:1>
no doubt these literary associations were still very strong for him ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #65:1>
and it is poignant to note that many years later , in the first years of the twentieth century when the area had degenerated into a slum , it was in this house that a certain John Langstaff established the David Copperfield Library for the poor children of the neighbourhood .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #66:1>
So the dreams of each generation can be transmitted through books - from the time when the young Dickens read Tom Jones , and looked out upon the area where some of its events had taken place , to the time when another young boy might read Great Expectations a few yards from the house where its author had spent a portion of his own disordered childhood .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #67:1>
During the course of these various moves John Dickens continued his work as a clerk in Somerset House , his first application for retirement having lapsed &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #68:1>
and , with the knowledge that most if not all of his colleagues had heard about his imprisonment for debt , this could not have been the easiest of periods for him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #69:1>
Certainly he was soon reapplying for retirement , which suggests that he was no longer happy with the work upon which he had been engaged for some nineteen years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #70:1>
Yet he went to the office every day still , walking from Hampstead and then Somers Town to the Strand ( the distance from Hampstead being something like five miles ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #71:1>
On these journeys he would have been accompanied by his son , himself working in that same neighbourhood ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #72:1>
and it is tempting to speculate upon their relationship to each other in this period - the father continuing with a job he was finding more and more disagreeable ( and of course still troubled by that infection of the urinary organs which seems to have flared up at times of crisis ) , and the son going daily to a place he hated and feared in equal measure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #73:1>
It is not evident why John and Elizabeth Dickens wanted their son to continue working in the blacking ware<l>house after the release from the Marshalsea &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #74:1>
but no doubt they still needed the money which he brought home each Saturday night ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #75:1>
and in any case he clearly never uttered a word about his own feelings of being unloved and abandoned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #76:1>
It may be , in addition , that it was necessary for Charles Dickens to keep on working in order to prove that his father was truly an &ldquo; insolvent &rdquo; person .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #77:1>
And , as they walked together , around them sprang the morning life of the metropolis &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #78:1>
the clerks and office boys already streaming in to the city from the outlying areas ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #79:1>
the apprentices sweeping their shops and watering the pavements outside ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #80:1>
the children and servants already crowding the bakers ' shops ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #81:1>
the fast coaches going on their appointed rounds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #82:1>
But , for the young Dickens , above all the sun rising over another blank day , over the dreariness and the subdued low pain of loss .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #83:1>
A loss made all the greater , from his own account , by the spectacle of seeing his older sister win a prize - or , rather , two prizes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #84:1>
On 29 June of this fatal and memorable year she was awarded the Academy 's silver medal for good conduct as well as a second prize for the piano .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #85:1>
There were to be problems later when John Dickens could no longer afford to pay the tuition fees of his daughter
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #86:1>
but on this occasion her prospects seemed bright indeed &semi; bright compared with those of her brother who was one of the family assembled to see Princess Augusta congratulate Fanny on her achievement :
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #87:1>
&ldquo; I could not bear to think of myself beyond the reach of all such honourable emulation and success .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #88:1>
The tears ran down my face .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #89:1>
I felt as if my heart were rent , I prayed , when I went to bed that night , to be lifted out of the humiliation and neglect in which I was .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #90:1>
I never had suffered so much before . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #91:1>
And then he adds , &ldquo; There was no envy in this . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #92:1>
In part this last remark is simply a reflection of Dickens 's usual inability to admit that he possessed any faults -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #93:1>
on all such occasions he adopts a passive role as sufferer or victim -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #94:1>
but in a sense the experience he had was too deep to be that merely of &ldquo; envy &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #95:1>
His whole life seemed to have been thrown away , and on an occasion such as this the full truth of his situation must have impinged very deeply upon him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #96:1>
When in the company of Bob Fagin and Paul Green , no doubt his hurt was assuaged by routine duties and by companionship &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #97:1>
but to see his sister in a world above his own , with companions far cleverer and cleaner than his own , to see her petted and praised by his parents , all this was a deep humiliation which nothing in his life afterwards ever seems to have eradicated .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #98:1>
And so he went on , the small boy walking through the streets of London to his place of work and then walking back again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #99:1>
Walking , and wandering , seem to comprise a large part of Dickens 's early years in London &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #100:1>
but that was quite usual in the period ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #101:1>
and most people would not think it surprising to make a round trip of ten miles as John and Charles Dickens had done each day on their journey from Hampstead to the Strand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #102:1>
Such efforts were taken for granted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #103:1>
But by his own account Dickens 's wanderings were of a more shiftless and dreamy nature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #104:1>
Particularly he came to know the area around the warehouse itself - the Strand , Covent Garden , Blackfriars Bridge and old London Bridge .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #105:1>
The major thoroughfares were already lit by the new gas , but this was not the bright and even glare of the late Victorian period :
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #106:1>
the light flared and diminished , casting a flickering light across the streets and lending to the houses and pedestrians a faintly unreal or even theatrical quality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #107:1>
He had already shown his interest in the noting and creating of &ldquo; characters &rdquo; -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #108:1>
he had , after all , completed his sketch on the barber of Gerrard Street and the deaf old lady who had waited on the Dickens family in Bayham Street -
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #109:1>
and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the young Dickens , walking through these fitfully illuminated streets , watching the passers-by , did not create his own stories out of his head just as he had done in the Marshalsea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #110:1>
Creating stories out of his own misery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-006 #111:1>
Out of his own sense of loss and of wonder .

<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #14:1>
The People 's Liberation Struggle
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #15:1>
On the eve of the German invasion in 1941 the Communist Party of Yugoslavia , ancestor of the present-day League of Communists ( SKJ ) , was a Stalinist and revolutionary organization which Tito had rejuvenated since the Comintern had appointed him to take it over .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #16:1>
With the war and liberation , it had acquired a good base of its own , and it stood out among the Communist parties that had taken power in east-central Europe as the one that had gone furthest on the way to copying the Soviet model before Stalin excommunicated it in 1948 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #17:1>
Finding itself rejected by its mentor , it was forced to look to its own base , and to adapt to a situation that would reflect the constraints of geography and mentality , while drawing from its Stalinism the strength to hold out against Stalin , before extracting from its Marxism-Leninism the ability to indulge in ambitious experiments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #18:1>
Without relinquishing its totalitarian origins and aspirations , Tito 's regime acquired a specificity which it owed partly to historical circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #19:1>
Titoism was to be charac<l>terized by the People 's Liberation Struggle as its source and inspiration by workers ' self-management and by non-alignment as principles of its domestic and foreign policies , respectively .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #20:1>
The People 's Liberation Struggle was actually more of a civil war for the control of post-war Yugoslavia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #21:1>
As such , it did little to heal war wounds and to rally patriotic feelings in a country where memories are long .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #22:1>
To support the claim that its monopoly of power is a defence against the threat of renewed strife between its domestic enemies , the Party has magnified and mythologized the partisan struggle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #23:1>
The recent interest in that period is a symptom of the dissatisfaction created by this policy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #24:1>
A brilliant idea in terms of ideology and publicity , self-management could , arguably , have been a useful model for an economy of industrial take-off at the time when it was conceived if it had really been applied .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #25:1>
Exploited as an all-purpose slogan , it was claimed as a substitute for political democracy but it turned into an economic disaster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #26:1>
As for non-alignment , it was but the latest in a series of &lsquo; grey-zone &rsquo; situations for the Yugoslav lands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #27:1>
For a while , it was of marginal international importance , but for the leadership it was a way of satisfying its foreign-policy ambi<l>tions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #28:1>
Serbs and Croats
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #29:1>
Serbs and Croats make up the core of the Yugoslav population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #30:1>
They are intermingled , speak the same language , have the most ancient collective self-awareness , and feel different .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #31:1>
Together they form an absolute majority of about 60% .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #32:1>
Religion remains the symbol of the differences .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #33:1>
Serbs , nominally Eastern Orthodox , are the most numerous , followed by Croats , nominally Roman Catholic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #34:1>
On the eve of the collapse of Austria-Hungary these two groups , along with their Catholic Slovene cousins to the north , had already fully developed such attributes as a modern language , a literature , a national ideology , political parties and an aspiration to greater unity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #35:1>
In the movement towards unification , differences were underrated , while all the emphasis was placed on common origins and affinities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #36:1>
The diversity of historical experiences can be reduced to two major trends which met in 1918 : Serbia 's , unitary and centralist , and Croatia 's , born of the institutional and ethnic complexity of Austria-Hungary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #37:1>
For the Serbs , their local Orthodox Church , the only surviving institution of the medieval kingdom , had continued the development of a conscious entity during the centuries of Turkish rule .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #38:1>
In the nineteenth century the growing embryo of a principality , and later kingdom , of Serbia provided the framework within which nationalism and politics could blossom , and contemplated the liberation and integration of kindred populations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #39:1>
This tradition assimilated the emancipation from Austrian and Hungarian overlordship to the wars of liberation against the Turks , and viewed the Yugoslav state as the final stage in the long process of liberation and unification .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #40:1>
The experience of the Croats was that of the continued separate existence of the &lsquo; Crown of Croatia &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #41:1>
It fell to the nobility , and later to the bourgeoisie , to continue to give shape to a wider national feeling during the centuries when that crown belonged to foreign dynasties , and the struggle for its rights kept it as a legal framework in which nationalism and politics were able to develop under the Habsburgs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #42:1>
By 1918 , Croatia 's political class yearned for a Yugoslavia where an extended Serbia would have been balanced by a consolidated Croatia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #43:1>
The Serbian tradition , modelled on the French post-revolutionary ideal , led to Serbian ( then Yugoslav ) integration of a nation defined by the state .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #44:1>
The Croatian , on the model of Hungary , perceived Yugoslavia as an improved dualistic system which would have strengthened Croatia 's historic rights .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #45:1>
The outcome of the constitutional confrontation was influenced by several factors which lent support to the unitarist trend , not least the romantic view of the one Yugoslav nation-to-be with its triple Serb-Croat-Slovene name .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #46:1>
The Serbian conception prevailed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #47:1>
The 1921 Constitution set up a centralized parliamentary government under the Serbian royal house .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #48:1>
Serbs were satisfied with the framework of the new state of Yugoslavia , which they viewed as the natural extension of their father<l>land .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #49:1>
Divided into regions and parties , far from seeing themselves as a domineering element , they thought themselves to be the ultimate rampart of a unified country for which they had given up their own identity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #50:1>
The disappointed Croats immediately began to demand a revision of the Constitution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #51:1>
Not numerous enough to change it by regular parliamen<l>tary procedure , they increasingly coalesced into one large ethnic party , which went back and forth between opposition and government , while a fringe would turn to violence feeding on more general frustration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #52:1>
The tragedy of pre-war Yugoslavia was that parliament was closed down in 1929 by King Alexander .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #53:1>
The Crown tried to foster &lsquo; Yugoslavism &rsquo; from above , but in so doing it merely alienated the Croats , while it irritated many Serbs , and others too .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #54:1>
Serbian and Croatian opposition coalesced in the 1930s , but it was with the Crown that the latter eventually struck a bargain which gave Croatia a special status .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #55:1>
This divided the opposition and caused bitterness on both sides .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #56:1>
The Axis then invaded and destroyed Yugoslavia , but the country was to come back to life , albeit in another form , in the wake of the collapse of Hitler 's New Order .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #57:1>
Postwar Yugoslavia
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #58:1>
Yugoslavia was restored after the war as a multinational state of related nations , united under the Communist Party .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #59:1>
The new federal division made additions to the three original components of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes whom the monarchy had failed to blend into a single Yugoslav people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #60:1>
The Macedonians to the south were acknowledged as a distinct nation , and the Yugoslav part of Macedonia was set up as a separate republic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #61:1>
The same status was granted to Montenegro , whose inhabitants were encouraged to identify with the territory 's historic identity rather than with the wider concept of Serbdom , and to Bosnia-Herzegovina , kept undivided because of its ethnic and religious compound of Orthodox Christians ( Serbs ) , Catholic Christians ( Croats ) and Muslims ( Serbo-Croat-speaking Slavs ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #62:1>
This produced the six constituent republics of the Com<l>munist federation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #63:1>
Furthermore , two autonomous regions were carved out of Serbia Vojvodina to the north and Kosovo to the south , because of their mixed ethnic composition , according to the Soviet model .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #64:1>
They had been the cradle of Serbdom , at the beginning of its medieval and of its modern development , respectively .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #65:1>
But Serbia had to be cut down to a size not too large in comparison with Croatia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #66:1>
What many felt to be Serbia 's dominant position had to be diminished , and satisfaction given to the differences that existed in these regions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #67:1>
As internationalists , the Yugoslav Communists had not had a consis<l>tent record in national matters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #68:1>
They had started as unitarists , had duti<l>fully turned disintegrationist to follow the Comintern line , before they were to convert to federalism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #69:1>
The Party had inserted itself into the resistance of Serbs during the war - mainly among Serbs outside Serbia - but it had also used the notion of Serbian hegemony to win support among other nationalities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #70:1>
It looked to the peripheral groups to weaken those at the core , Serbs and Croats , whom it wanted to equalize and neutralize .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #71:1>
At first , federalism was no more than a form , for it was subordinated to a new political unitarism , that of the Party , and to a new ideology of integration , that of Communism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #72:1>
It did , however , immediately give birth to regional political elites , who were to prosper with the decentralization that ex<l>panded after the break with Moscow in 1948 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #73:1>
Federalism - and nationalism
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #74:1>
By the late 1960s federalism was not only well established but was even turning to confederalism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #75:1>
The distribution of social goods had been one of the means initially used by the Party to acquire support .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #76:1>
The creation of a new elite and Soviet-style industrialization had led to large-scale social mobility .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #77:1>
After the chaos of the war years , people were more ready to accept rule from the centre , especially if backed by the lure of rapid economic progress .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #78:1>
In the 1960s , however , these possibilities were no longer what they had been , and the Party gave up its control of certain areas of social life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #79:1>
Ideology became less significant , and the primary object of the political elite turned to enjoying the privileges of power rather than trying to change society .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #80:1>
This was achieved by a combination of tactical concessions , selected repression , tolerance of particular interest rep<l>resentation within limits , and Western aid .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #81:1>
Having assumed more and more responsibilities , local Party leader<l>ships took on the representation of territorial interests as a way of legit<l>imizing their roles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #82:1>
Not able to satisfy the new post-revolutionary generations with more political or even economic freedom , the regime ignored the expression of nationalist feelings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #83:1>
To the extent that such a freedom weakened the more conservative wing of the Party , the de<l>centralizing reformers encouraged it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #84:1>
No sooner had social and economic developments led to a pluralist reaction against ideological and political uniformity than the Party was faced with the same multiform nationalism it had hoped to eliminate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #85:1>
Meanwhile , it had prevented any attempt at Yugoslav integration by means other than those of official ideology .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #86:1>
Driven by disappointment in the present , concern for the future and nostalgia for the past , feelings of nationalism flowed out again into old moulds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #87:1>
Without the possibility of discussing openly the all-important prob<l>lems the country had to face , national identity , because of its highly emotional character , was the question that tended to pervade all others .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #88:1>
The craving for more freedom of expression was all too often reduced to a need to call oneself by the name of one 's nationality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #89:1>
Faith in a supra<l>national Communist ideology having failed , people fell back upon the collectivity to which they felt they belonged .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #90:1>
Economic , social and even political grievances were increasingly seen as national grievances in a state that had a minorities problem and no integrative national feeling .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #91:1>
In the 1960s , it turned out that Yugoslavia 's national question was much more serious than in the 1930s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #92:1>
Before the war , the problem had been primarily seen in political and constitutional terms &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #93:1>
30 years later , it had become economic , social and cultural as well .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #94:1>
More nationalities had been recognized , assisted in inverse proportion to their numerical importance and historic seniority , so as to divide the population into smaller categories and speed up their integration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #95:1>
Yugoslavia , which had been set up again as a federation of nations , was turned into a confederation of territories with the 1974 Constitution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #96:1>
That was the fourth of the Titoist regime 's fundamental laws , the longest , most verbose and most confusing , bringing together what had become the twin evils of the SKJ - nationalism and langue de bois .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #97:1>
In principle and in rhetoric , it was made to appear as the final outcome of the country 's socialist progress - a charter of the working class .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #98:1>
In reality , it institutionalized the nationalism it could no longer oppose , by giving the parts - the federated units - greater rights than the whole - the federation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #99:1>
The autonomous regions , which had become autonomous provinces with increased prerogatives in the 1960s , were equated with the republics in all but name , while the domain of the federal government was reduced to defence , foreign affairs , certain limited prerogatives of econ<l>omic and financial policy , and the overall maintenance of the constitu<l>tional system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-007 #100:1>
Even in those areas , however , policies could only be adopted and implemented through the &lsquo; consensus &rsquo; or unanimous consent of the federated units .

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #1:1>
Bernstein 's 1959 CBS coupling was recorded when ( at the beginning of his forties ) he was at the peak of his creativity , with West Side Story only two years behind him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #2:1>
This record set the standard by which all subsequent pairings of these two works came to be judged .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #3:1>
It still sounds astonishingly well as a recording &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #4:1>
the Rhapsody in particular has better piano-tone than CBS often provided in the 1970s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #5:1>
Bernstein 's approach is inspirational , exceptionally flexible but completely spontaneous .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #6:1>
Although the jazzy element is not masked , it is essentially a concert performance , fully justifying the expanded orchestration , masterly in every way , with much broader tempi than in the composer 's piano-roll version , but quixotic in mood , rhythmically subtle and creating a life-enhancing surge of human warmth at the entry of the big central tune .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #7:1>
The performance of An American in Paris is vividly characterized , brash and episodic &semi; an unashamedly American view , with the great blues tune marvellously timed and phrased as only a great American orchestra can do it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #8:1>
Though the Grof&eacute; bonus is by no means indispensable , the Gershwin performances certainly are .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #9:1>
From the opening glissando swirl on the clarinet , the performance of the Rhapsody in blue by Gwenneth Pryor and the LSO under Richard Williams tingles with adrenalin , and the other performances are comparable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #10:1>
The Rhapsody has splendid rhythmic energy , yet the performers can relax to allow the big expressive blossoming at the centre really to expand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #11:1>
Similarly in the Concerto , the combination of vitality and flair and an almost voluptuous response to the lyrical melodies is very involving .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #12:1>
An American in Paris , briskly paced , moves forward in an exhilarating sweep , with the big blues tune vibrant and the closing section managed to perfection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #13:1>
The performances are helped by superb recording , made in the EMI No. 1 Studio &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #14:1>
but it is the life and spontaneity of the music-making that enthral the listener throughout all three works .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #15:1>
The digital remastering of Previn 's EMI set , made at the beginning of the 1970s , has brought a striking enhancement of the recording itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #16:1>
There is now much more sparkle , and the extra vividness comes without loss of body &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #17:1>
indeed , in the Concerto the strings sound particularly full and fresh and the piano timbre clean and natural .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #18:1>
The performance of the Concerto was always a fine one by any standards , but now in the Rhapsody one senses many affinities with the famous Bernstein account .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #19:1>
An American in Paris is exuberantly volatile , and the entry of the great blues tune on the trumpet has a memorable rhythmic lift .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #20:1>
This is generally preferable to Previn 's later , Philips CD , made in Pittsburgh , but now should be reissued at mid-price .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #21:1>
Jerome Lowenthal forms a stimulating partnership with Abravanel and these are vividly spontaneous performances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #22:1>
Perhaps the end of An American in Paris is made too grandly spacious , but the earlier sequences have plenty of colour and zest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #23:1>
The full , resonant Utah sound is particularly attractive in the Concerto .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #24:1>
Among the other British and European compilations , the Philips collection from Monte Carlo stands out .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #25:1>
Again , digital remastering has brought noticeable improvement in the sound , which always had appealing body and warmth &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #26:1>
now the treble is brighter but not edgier and , although the upper range is still not as wide as on more recent versions , there is no real feeling of restriction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #27:1>
The Concerto is particularly successful &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #28:1>
its lyrical moments have a quality of nostalgia which is very attractive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #29:1>
Werner Haas is a volatile and sympathetic soloist , and his rhythmic verve is refreshing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #30:1>
Edo de Waart 's An American in Paris is not only buoyant but glamorous , too -
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #31:1>
the big blues melody is highly seductive and , as with all the best accounts of this piece , the episodic nature of the writing is hidden .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #32:1>
There is a cultured , European flavour to this music-making that does not detract from its vitality , and the jazz inflexions are not missed , with plenty of verve in the Rhapsody .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #33:1>
Daniel Blumenthal gives performances of the two concertante pieces which convincingly combine Ravelian delicacy of articulation with genuine feeling for the jazz-based idiom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #34:1>
The syncopations are often naughtily pointed , to delightful effect , and Bedford and the ECO , unlikely accompanists as they may be , give warm and understanding support .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #35:1>
An American in Paris is warmly done too but with less panache , the episodic nature of the piece undisguised .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #36:1>
For those seeking a cultured flavour in this music , however , this can be strongly recommended as an alternative to Haas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #37:1>
The mid-priced RCA CD is particularly generous ( 70 minutes ) in including , besides the usual triptych , the &lsquo; I got rhythm &rsquo; variations I got rhythm √≠ variations , given plenty of rhythmic panache .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #38:1>
Indeed these are essentially jazzy performances :
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #39:1>
Earl Wild 's playing is full of energy and brio , and he inspires Arthur Fiedler to a similarly infectious response .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #40:1>
The outer movements of the Concerto are comparably volatile and the blues feeling of the slow movement is strong .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #41:1>
At the end of An American in Paris Fiedler adds to the exuberance by bringing in a bevy of motor horns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #42:1>
The brightly remastered recording suits the music-making , though the resonant Boston acoustics at times prevent absolute sharpness of focus :
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #43:1>
ideally , the spectacular percussion at the beginning of the Concerto should sound cleaner .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #44:1>
Ozawa 's American in Paris ( 1977 ) sounds well in digitally remastered form .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #45:1>
It is easy to respond to such opulence , with the performers revealing the music 's vivid tunefulness and rich scoring , but this is clearly overpriced and should have been reissued on DG 's mid-priced label -
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #46:1>
the Russo coupling is far from indispensable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #47:1>
Eugene List has also recorded the Rhapsody in blue for Turnabout .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #48:1>
On that occasion he used the original scoring &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #49:1>
on Telarc he is accompanied by a full symphony orchestra and is recorded very sumptuously indeed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #50:1>
The rich sound is ideal for those who like to wallow in the melodic richness of An American in Paris .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #51:1>
The blues tune certainly sounds expansive and there is no real lack of vitality , although in both works the hi-fi-conscious engineers have provided rather too much bass drum ( a characteristic of Telarc CDs ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #52:1>
The Montreal players bring a mischievous Gallic flair and an attractively light touch to An American in Paris which , if not entirely idiomatic , is certainly infectious .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #53:1>
The Cuban overture has a comparable racy vitality and the Rhapsody in blue is strong in rhythmic feeling .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #54:1>
But several more convincing versions of the latter piece exist , and the famous Symphonic picture from Porgy and Bess sounds more opulently magical in Dorati 's hands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #55:1>
The Decca engineers have sought here to achieve an essentially bright and vivid effect by placing their microphones fairly close , and some of the lustre of the St Eustache ambience has been lost :
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #56:1>
the result is comparatively brash .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #57:1>
Maazel 's triptych dates from 1974 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #58:1>
The performances of all three works are strikingly energetic ( Ivan Davis both brilliant and sophisticated in the Rhapsody ) and the boisterous account of the Cuban overture is immensely spirited , almost disguising its emptiness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #59:1>
But the big tune at the centre of the Rhapsody and the blues melody in An American in Paris ( given an upbeat reading ) are lacking in sensuous warmth , which means that a dimension is missing in both works .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X60:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X61:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X62:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X63:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #64:1>
The remastered Tilson Thomas CD anthology centres on the famous l976 recording of the Rhapsody in blue , which added to the piano-rolls of the composer 's own performance of the piano part an exhilarating accompaniment ( 1920s style ) by the Columbia Jazz Band , using the original Whiteman score .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #65:1>
The result proved refreshingly controversial -
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #66:1>
there is one tutti which sounds like an old film speeded up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #67:1>
Tilson Thomas 's direction of An American in Paris has comparable flair , and the Broadway overtures are given expert and idiomatic performances , with the Buffalo Philharmonic clearly on their toes and enjoying themselves , but the remastering has lost some of the body of the original analogue sound and is a little flat and two-dimensional .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X68:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X69:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #X70:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #71:1>
Directing the orchestra , of which he is principal conductor , from the keyboard Andrew Litton gives an exceptionally refined account of the Concerto in F .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #72:1>
If he brings out links with French music , as typified by the Ravel Concerto which comes as coupling , he will not always please those who seek an idiomatic , conventional reading .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #73:1>
The Bournemouth players , for all their incisiveness and precision , sound rather literal in the big , expansive moments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #74:1>
But as a coupling for an outstanding , totally idiomatic version of the Ravel , it is well worth considering since , with textures made luminous , it is most beautifully recorded .

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #88:1>
In his most recent recording for DG , Bernstein rather goes over the top with his jazzing of the solos in Gershwin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #89:1>
The encore too brings seductively swung rhythms , one of the three solo piano Preludes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #90:1>
Such rhythmic freedom was clearly the result of a live rather than a studio performance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #91:1>
The big melody in Rhapsody in blue is rather too heavily pointed for comfort .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #92:1>
The immediacy of the occasion is most compellingly projected , but this does not match Bernstein 's inspired 1959 analogue coupling for CBS .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #93:1>
This version has been reissued at mid-price , coupled with Barber 's Adagio and two extracts from Bernstein 's own West Side story , but without the Prelude .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #94:1>
Michael Tilson Thomas 's newest Gershwin record supplements rathe than displaces his earlier account of Rhapsody in blue accompanying the composer 's 1924 piano-roll , and there is not quite the same hell-for-leather excitement and zest for life that the earlier performance generated .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #95:1>
Moreover the Second Rhapsody is far from being one of Gershwin 's best pieces .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #96:1>
What is a real discovery , however , is Sleepless night , an altogether enchanting miniature , poignant and touching .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #97:1>
This and some of the other piano works that Tilson Thomas plays with such style are new to the catalogue .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #98:1>
The Violin piece is previously unpublished .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #99:1>
Andrew Litton follows in Michael Tilson Thomas 's footsteps by adopting the original Whiteman score of the Rhapsody in blue .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #100:1>
The performance is lively enough and thoughtful too , so it has some elements of the Bernstein approach .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #101:1>
In its way this is very enjoyable and far better recorded than the CBS version &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #102:1>
but the rhythmic inflexions are clearly from this side of the Atlantic , and this applies even more strikingly to the ( attractively ) amiable performance of Hershy Kay 's ballet-score adapted from Gershwin 's own &lsquo; Song Book for Balanchine &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #103:1>
Litton then usefully plays as solo piano items the four remaining songs which Kay discarded , and very well too .

This is an attractive re-assembly of the Gershwin numbers taken from the famous Menuhin/Grappelli series of studio collaborations in which two distinguished musicians from different musical backgrounds struck sparks off each other to most entertaining effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #108:1>
The songs are all famous and the treatments highly felicitous .

Catfish Row was arranged by the composer after the initial failure of his opera and already existed when in 1941 Fritz Reiner commissioned Robert Russell Bennett 's more sumptuous Symphonic picture , which uses much of the same material .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #115:1>
It includes a brief piano solo , played with fine style by William Tritt in the highly sympathetic Telarc performance which is very well recorded .

The original jazz-band version of the Rhapsody is here without the breathless momentum of the famous piano-roll version with the composer on CBS , but it is notable in including some 44 bars of music later cut out by the composer ( not always to disadvantage ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #121:1>
The Concerto has a nostalgically memorable slow movement , but the outer movements are somewhat lacking in sheer verve .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #122:1>
However , both the Rialto ripples rag and the engaging &lsquo; I got rhythm &rsquo; variations are played with attractive and stylish flair .

<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #131:1>

In Dame Kiri 's gorgeously sung Summertime from Porgy and Bess , the distanced heavenly chorus creates the purest kitsch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #141:1>
But most of the numbers are done in an upbeat style , which has the advantage of carrying the vocal introductions before the verse and preventing their sounding superfluous out of stage context .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #142:1>
Dame Kiri is at her most relaxed and ideally there should be more variety of pacing :
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #143:1>
The man I love is thrown away at the chosen tempo .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #144:1>
But for the most part the ear is seduced by the lovely sounds and the direct rhythmic style of the presentation &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #145:1>

Barbara Hendricks is at her finest in the operatic numbers ( I loves you , Porgy is particularly eloquent ) , and the warm beauty of the voice gives much pleasure throughout the programme .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #153:1>
The performances of the songs are lushly cultured , often indulgently slow ( even the faster numbers lack something in vitality ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #154:1>
The piano arrangements are elaborate &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #155:1>

Of Thee I Sing and Let &lsquo; em Eat Cake are the two operettas that George Gershwin wrote in the early 193Os on a political theme , the one a sequel to the other .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #162:1>
Though the aim is satirical in both works , the musical tone of voice has the easy tunefulness of typical Gershwin shows , with only the occasional hint of Kurt Weill to suggest a more international source of inspiration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #163:1>
What the British listener will immediately register is the powerful underlying influence of Gilbert and Sullivan , not just in the plot - with Gilbertian situations exploited - but also in the music , with patter-songs and choral descants used in a very Sullivan-like manner .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #164:1>
In every way these two very well-filled discs are a delight , offering warm and energetic performances by excellent artists under Michael Tilson Thomas , not just a star conductor but a leading Gershwin scholar .

Both Larry Kert and Maureen McGovern as his wife make a strong partnership , with Jack Gilford characterful as the Vice-Presidential candidate , Alexander Throttlebottom , and Paige O'Hara excellent as the interloping Diana in Of Thee I Sing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #166:1>
With the recording on the dry side and well forward - very apt for a musical - the words are crystal clear , not least from the splendidly disciplined chorus that , for much of the time , is protagonist .
<ICE-GB:W2B-008 #167:1>
The well-produced booklets ( one for each operetta ) give full words - though , as with many CD sets , you need a magnifying glass to read them .

Politics and war
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X3:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #4:1>
By adopting this slogan , which originated in the &lsquo; permissive &rsquo; 1960s , women have turned their own interest in the personal to their advantage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #5:1>
In theories about &lsquo; sexual politics &rsquo; , the personal sexual relationship is shown to hold overtones of domination and submission , with generally the male dominating the female .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #6:1>
Kate Millett claims that , until the balance of power shifts , especially in sexual relationships , to equality between the sexes , no change in systematised male supremacy will occur :

1. Kate Millett , Sexual Politics , p. 21 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #9:1>
According to Millett , this sexual domination by men over women is taken for granted , not only in the bedroom , but in every sphere :

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #15:1>
Millett applies her social theorising to a literary deconstruction of a few male authors , in which she asserts that only Jean Genet , the French dramatist , has &lsquo; transcended the sexual myths of our era &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #16:1>
for example , in The Balcony , he &lsquo; explores the pathology of virility , the chimera of sexual congress as a paradigm of power over other human beings &rsquo; . 3
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #17:1>
3 Ibid. , p. 22 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #18:1>
Since Kate Millett 's criticism of authors such as Norman Mailer , Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence appeared , women writers have become more aware of patriarchal and sexist ideologies which are expressed in both male and female fiction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #19:1>
If fiction is either imbued with or subverts the cultural world-views of its period , then what of twentieth-century fiction by women in relation to male power in all spheres ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #20:1>
Are there many female authors who attempt in their work to overturn the patriarchal customs and rules which are linked to sexual power and virility ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #21:1>
Only a few women writers in the first half of the twentieth century have engaged with the problems of the inequalities of women vis-&agrave;-vis men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #22:1>
Twentieth-century women 's novels can be roughly divided into two periods , that is , pre- and post-1960 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #23:1>
Prior to 1960 , we can discover novels which can be said to trace or present the ideas and beliefs of &lsquo; first wave feminism &rsquo; , that is , the movement during the early part of this century towards achieving equality for women , especially in the matter of the vote .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #24:1>
The heroines of these novels , such as Sybylla in Franklin 's My Brilliant Career or Hervey in Jameson 's Mirror in Darkness , emerge individually into equality with men , rather than developing with other women a collective opposition to the subjection of women by men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #25:1>
Some of the novels by women in which the narrator concentrates on male politics , particularly the clash between left- and right-wing forces , are also centred on a heroine who seeks equality with men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #26:1>
An example of this kind of mixture of male and female politics occurs in Storm Jameson 's trilogy , Mirror in Darkness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #27:1>
In this work , the narrator tries for a panoramic view of class politics in Britain after 1918 , including the depiction of harrowing scenes such as the death of an undernourished small boy , Clive , in his cockroach-infested basement , and Frank Rigby 's loss of employment as a bus-driver subsequent to the 1926 General Strike .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #28:1>
This portrayal of class poverty and power politics is anodyne , however , in comparison with the characterisation of Hervey Russell , who engages in &lsquo; sexual politics &rsquo; , not as a feminist might , but as one of those exceptional women who make close friends only with men , competing with them on her own terms , even to the point of giving up the intimate mothering of her son .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #29:1>
Hervey , a journalist and novelist , exists on the fringe of a group of male socialists and other radicals who become involved in either fostering or negotiating an end to a fictionalised version of the actual 1926 General Strike .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #30:1>
Apart from Hervey , most of the other women characters tend to fall in with the demands of their men and their children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #31:1>
Rachel , for example , wife of the socialist MP , Louis Earlham , criticises her husband 's lukewarm socialism and , at the same time , cannot see how she retreats from politics into the nurture of her two young children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #32:1>
Frank Rigby 's wife endures working-class poverty dutifully .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #33:1>
But Hannah , Renn 's lover , is an exception , like Hervey , among these domesticated women :

4 Storm Jameson , None Turn Back , Mirror in Darkness , vol. III ( London : Cassell &ampersand; Co. , 1936 ) &semi; reprinted Virago , 1984 , p. 256 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #40:1>
But Hannah is not a putative feminist like Hervey who wants equal opportunities with men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #41:1>
Instead she wants to exploit and enjoy her sexual attraction towards and for men as fully as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #42:1>
The narrator , despite identifying possible ways to freedom for women , is blind to the anomaly of women taking little part in political or social action .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #43:1>
In Kylie Tennant 's Tiburon ( 1935 ) , some women take part in a 1930s strike in which the unemployed refuse to &lsquo; scab &rsquo; on other unskilled labourers , and therefore do not take jobs offered at a lower rate of pay than that agreed by the majority of such labourers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #44:1>
But it is the men who strike , and the women who dole out soup to the unemployed who are refused relief , that is , unemployment benefit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #45:1>
But in Katherine Susannah Prichard 's goldfields ' trilogy , The Roaring Nineties ( 1946 ) , Golden Miles ( 1948 ) , and Winged Seeds ( 1950 ) , which is partly an historical reconstruction of events on the West Australian goldfields from 1892 onwards , central female characters such as Nadya Owen and Sally Gough are not only working wives and mothers , but also become political reformers who work with male radicals in order to bring about change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #46:1>
Prichard 's trilogy is exceptional in its portrayal of women who are active in trade union politics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #47:1>
Jean Devanny 's Cindie ( 1949 ) , which is of that same period and is also set in a masculine working world - that of sugar plantation life in Queensland - is not so adventurous in its presentation of its eponymous heroine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #48:1>
Cindie is the equal of any male manager , but she is not shown actively engaging in politics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #49:1>
Nevertheless , the Australian Communist Party disliked the narrator 's account of labour relations between Europeans and Kanakas ( Melanesians ) and their disapproval led to Devanny 's resignation from that Party .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #50:1>
The hostility of the Party leadership was probably a reaction to comments by the narrator on , for example , the racialism of socialists :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #51:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #52:1>
5 Jean Devanny , Cindie ( London : Robert Hale , 1949 ) &semi; reprinted Virago , 1986 , p. 311 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #53:1>
The characterisation of the heroine , Cindie , might also have alienated these Party readers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #54:1>
Cindie is egalitarian in her attitude to other races , including aborigines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #55:1>
When asked by her friend , Jeff , how she managed to get the aborigines to fell trees for her when most of the other station-owners and managers could not get them to work consistently at any labouring job , she replied , &lsquo; simply treat them exactly the same as I treat white men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X56:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #57:1>
6 Ibid. , Virago , p. 173 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #58:1>
Cindie competes successfully with men in sugar plantation management , which strikes a fictional blow against the sexism of macho outback men then and now .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #59:1>
The novels of Christina Stead span almost the entire century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #60:1>
Some of her fiction both early and late reflects as well as subverts changing reactions to women by men , and by women to each other .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #61:1>
In her first novel , Seven Poor Men of Sydney ( 1934 ) , for example , in which the narration is centred on male politics in the period from just prior to the First World War until the 1920s , one of the main characters , Baruch , makes a telling comment on the status of women :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #62:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X63:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X64:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X65:1>

7 Christina Stead , Seven Poor Men of Sydney ( London : Peter Davies , 1934 ) reprinted Australia : Angus &ampersand; Robertson , 1965 , paperback 1981 , pp. 205 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #69:1>
Thus the narrator , through Baruch 's simplistic exaggerations , is putting across one of the more neglected aspects of political feminism : how to make an analysis of women 's subjection by men in relation to subjection according to class .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #70:1>
Women , however , although under subjection , are not actually in a class of their own , but in an underrated grouping according to gender , which cuts across all classes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #71:1>
Stead 's narrator also demonstrates how , in the 1930s , both men and women found &lsquo; dogmas &rsquo; such as the notion that women are in some ways inferior to men hard to give up , especially those who enjoyed the unpaid services of women .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #72:1>
Milt Dean , for example , in response to Baruch 's statement , defends what he believes is &lsquo; feminine &rsquo; :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #73:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #75:1>
8 Ibid. , paperback , p. 205 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #76:1>
But a woman could just as easily utter such platitudes in reverse about her partner .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #77:1>
In this novel , both sides to the question of women 's rights and women 's subjection are presented through various characters by the concealed narrator , and the reader can draw her own conclusions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #78:1>
Although the narrator makes no direct statements about women 's participation in this male political world , the lives of two ineffectual female revolutionaries , Catherine Baguenault and Marion Folliot , indirectly comment on the disproportionate lack of power exerted by women in the male political world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #79:1>
Catherine falls in and out of love with various radical men , as well as espousing good works , and Marion , the wife of one of the leading Communists , Fulke Folliott , flirts with all the radical males she meets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #80:1>
These women try to use men to meet their sexual needs , rather than to attempt to co-operate politically with them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #81:1>
Cotters ' England ( 1967 ) , which brings us into the era of the beginning of 1960s feminist collectivism , or what might be called &lsquo; second wave feminism &rsquo; , takes an ironic view of post-1966 left-wing women who unite politically .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #82:1>
Her anti-heroine , Nellie Cotter , is portrayed as developing a cynical , man-parodying lust for power over women which leads her to bring about a young woman 's suicide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #83:1>
Nellie gives an all-women week-end party at her own home in her husband 's absence :

9 Christina Stead , Cotters ' England ( London : Secker &ampersand; Warburg , 1967 ) &semi; reprinted Virago , 1981 ) , pp. 276-90 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #89:1>
The narrator indirectly criticises these characters for their lack of femininity , and in her comparison of them with &lsquo; disorderly men &rsquo; she suggests that if women are allowed to become equal to men at work , then their behaviour will become as anti-life as that of men in similar work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #90:1>
Nellie is the most depraved of all these women :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #91:1>
she encourages Caroline , who lives with Nellie and her husband , to try to sleep during the party , on the pretext that sleeping during the party will help her with her persistent insomnia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #92:1>
Then Nellie terrorises her :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #93:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X94:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #100:1>
10 Ibid. , Virago , p. 291 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #101:1>
The narrator 's transmogrification of the naked women - seen through Caroline 's point of view - into various types of &lsquo; queer fish &rsquo; hints at the seamier side of some lesbian behaviour &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #102:1>
the female seahorse , for example , reverses sexual roles and implants the male with its young .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #103:1>
Caroline is afraid of Nellie 's attempts to get her to join in the nude dancing and runs off .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #104:1>
But she broods over Nellie 's earlier insinuations about Caroline 's destiny :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #105:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X106:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X107:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #X109:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #110:1>
11 Ibid. , pp. 296-7 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #111:1>
Caroline becomes convinced that suicide is her destiny and jumps to her death from a tall block to the ground below .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #112:1>
Thus Nellie , who has been unable to acquire much power in journalism or politics , creates for herself a perverse hold over Caroline .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #113:1>
Nellie , the liberated woman who has equality with men in both politics and work , misuses her power in a way that is similar to that of corrupt men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #114:1>
If Nellie prefigures the late twentieth-century feminist , then women and men are shown to have equal potential for perverse wielding of power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #115:1>
Meridel Le Sueur 's The Girl ( 1978 ) also spans the 1930s to the 1970s , in that this novel was first written as a series of sketches in 1939 and rewritten in this published version in 1977-8 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #116:1>
This first-person narration by &lsquo; the girl &rsquo; , which is presented by a covert narrator , subverts patriarchal conventions about the importance of virility as an adjunct to the exercise of masculine power over both women and weaker men .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #117:1>
Through &lsquo; the girl 's &rsquo; eyes , we see the social , economic , and personal corruption that is brought about by the assertion of macho power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #118:1>
The Girl is set during the period of the 1930s depression in a mid-western American town .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #119:1>
Butch and Bill want to work , and are willing to scab on fellow workers who are on strike at the local foundry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #120:1>
When they turn up for work there on &lsquo; Blue Monday &rsquo; , Bill is shot and killed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #121:1>
Butch then gets involved with Ganz , a big-time crook who organises a bank raid in which &lsquo; the girl &rsquo; is the driver of the getaway car .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #122:1>
She agrees to their plan because she is pregnant by Butch and wants the stolen money so that they can get married .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #123:1>
The raid turns into a fiasco :
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #124:1>
Butch shoots the other two gang members because they are running off with the loot , and is then wounded himself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #125:1>
&lsquo; The girl &rsquo; helps Butch escape , but she is too frightened to seek medical treatment for fear of capture , and her lover dies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #126:1>
This narrative is a send-up of romances about knights fighting valiantly for their true loves , since Butch only achieves a bank raid which goes wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2B-009 #127:1>
And even if he had stolen money from the bank , he finds that his plan to start up a service station is just a chimera :

In the late 1950s / early 1960s , Granada TV in the UK was promoted via a series of print ads giving facts about &lsquo; Granadaland &rsquo; , the area covered by the company and then com<l>prising Lancashire and Yorkshire .

These lines are from a poem called &lsquo; Solitude &rsquo; ( 1883 ) by Ella Wheeler Wilcox ( 1855-1919 ) and , as CODP points out , are an alteration of the sentiment ex<l>pressed by Horace in his Ars Poetica : &lsquo; Men 's faces laugh on those who laugh , and correspondingly weep on those who weep . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #44:1>
Another alteration is : &lsquo; ... weep , and you sleep alone &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #45:1>

Laugh-In .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #49:1>
A quintessential late 1960s sound was announcer Gary Owens , with hand cupped to
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #50:1>
ear , intoning , This is beautiful downtown Burbank - an ironic compliment to the area of Los Angeles where NBC TV 's studios are located and where Rowan and Martin 's Laugh-In was recorded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #51:1>
An enormous hit on US televi<l>sion from its inception in 1967 , Laugh-In lasted until 1973 and was briefly revived , without Rowan and Martin , and with little success , in 1977 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #52:1>
The original was a brightly-coloured , fast-moving series of sketches and gags , with a wide range of stock characters , linked together by the relaxed charm of Dan Rowan ( 1922-87 ) and Dick Martin ( b 1923 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #53:1>
For a while , the whole of America was ringing to the programme 's catch phrases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #54:1>
The most famous of these was sock it to me ! spoken by the English actress , Judy Carne ( b 1939 ) who became known as the Sock-It-To-Me Girl .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #55:1>
She would appear and chant the phrase until - ever unsuspecting - something dread<l>ful happened to her .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #56:1>
She would be dren<l>ched with a bucket of water , fall through a trap door , get blown up , or find herself shot from a cannon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #57:1>
The phrase &lsquo; to sock it to someone &rsquo; orig<l>inally meant &lsquo; to put something bluntly &rsquo; ( and was used as such by Mark Twain ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #58:1>
Negro jazz musicians gave it a sexual meaning , as in &lsquo; I 'd like to sock it to her . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #59:1>
The precise way in which this old phrase came to be adopted by Laugh-In was described to me by Judy Carne in 1980 :
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #60:1>
&lsquo; George Schlatter , the producer , had had great success in America with a show starring Ernie Kovacs in the 1950s .

In the summer of 1967 , Aretha Frank<l>lin had a hit record with &lsquo; Respect &rsquo; which featured a chorus repeating &lsquo; Sock it to me &rsquo; quite rapidly in the background .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #64:1>
The previous year there had been a disc called &lsquo; Sock it to 'em , J.B. &rsquo; by Rex Garvin with Mighty Craven , and in February 1967 an LP entitled &lsquo; Sock it to me , baby &rsquo; had come from Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #65:1>
But Aretha Franklin 's record was where the Laugh-In catch phrase came from .

Among the guests on the show who spoke the line were John Wayne , Mae West , Jack Lemmon , Jimmy Durante , Marcel Marceau ( even ) and Richard Nixon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #78:1>
The latter , running for the US presidency , said it on the show broadcast 16 September 1968 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #79:1>
He pronounced it in a perplexed manner : &lsquo; Sock it to me ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #80:1>
And , lo , they finally did .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #81:1>
The next most famous phrase from the show was probably , very interesting ... but stupid ! ( &lsquo; but it stinks &rsquo; , or some other variant ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #82:1>
This was spoken in a thick ac<l>cent by Arte Johnson as a bespectacled German soldier wearing a helmet and peering through a potted plant .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #83:1>
The third notable phrase was you bet your sweet bippy ! - usually spoken by Dick Martin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #84:1>
Other phrases from the show included : here come de judge !
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #85:1>
The old vau<l>deville phrase had a revival when Dewey &lsquo; Pigmeat &rsquo; Markham , a black veteran , was brought back to take part in a series of blackout sketches to which the build-up was the chant , &lsquo; Here comes de judge ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #86:1>
Judge : Have you ever been up before me ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #87:1>
Defendant : I don't know - what time do you get up ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #88:1>
In July 1968 , Pigmeat and an American vocalist called Shorty Long both had records of a song called &lsquo; Here Come(s) the Judge &rsquo; in the US and UK charts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #89:1>

Rowan and Martin 's concluding exchange was a straight lift from the old George Burns and Gracie Allen sign-off on The Burns and Allen Show :
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #96:1>

In 1932 , William B. Pitkin ( 1878-1953 ) , Professor of Journalism at Columbia University , published a book called Life Begins at Forty in which he dealt with &lsquo; adult reorientation &rsquo; at a time when the problems of extended life and leisure were beginning to be recognized .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #233:1>
Based on lectures Pitkin had given , the book was a hearty bit of uplift :
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #234:1>

As for Churchill - well , John Colville , his private secretary , seems to quote a French source in his diary for 13 June 1940 ( &lsquo; some gleam of light at the far end of the tunnel &rsquo; ) , quotes Paul Reynaud , the French PM on 16 June ( &lsquo; the ray of light at the end of the tunnel &rsquo; ) , and himself uses it on 31 May 1952 , &lsquo; I think it is more that he [ Churchill ] cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel . &rsquo;

The urge to say that everything in sight was &lsquo; like a fairy-tale &rsquo; was , of course , rampant at the nuptials of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in July 1981 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #291:1>
Tom Fleming , the BBC TV commentator for the fixture , said the bride was &lsquo; like a fairy-tale prin<l>cess &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #292:1>
Even Robert Runcie , Archbishop of Canterbury , began his address at St Paul 's :
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #293:1>
&lsquo; Here is the stuff of which fairy-tales are made . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #294:1>
&lsquo; It was just like a fairy-tale &rsquo; is also a clich&eacute; put into the mouths of unsuspect<l>ing members of the public by popular journalists when they are trying to de<l>scribe some rather pleasant thing that has happened to them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #295:1>
As Iona and Peter Opie point out , however , in The Classic Fairy Tales ( 1974 ) , this is a very partial way of looking at such matters :
<ICE-GB:W2B-010 #296:1>
&lsquo; When the wonderful happens , when a holiday abroad is a splendid success or an unlike<l>ly romance ends happily , we commonly exclaim it was &ldquo; just like a fairy tale &rdquo; , overlooking that most events in fairy tales are remarkable for their unpleas<l>antness , and that in some of the tales there is no happy ending , not even the hero or heroine escaping with their life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #1:1>
Rajiv found it frustrating that his policies made little impact on poverty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #2:1>
Any number of good ideas and endless quantities of money did not seem to him to be having much effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #3:1>
It is a frustration which reveals itself when he is asked how piloting a nation compares with piloting a plane , a question he has been asked dozens of times .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #4:1>
By way of reply , Rajiv invariably complains of the slow response time or inertia in &lsquo; piloting the nation &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #5:1>
&lsquo; There is so much free play in the controls that you can almost shake them at one end and nothing happens at the other end , &rsquo; is how he once put it in a BBC interview .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #6:1>
Even for an experienced airline pilot with the right instincts and ideas , the challenge of piloting a nation like India into the twenty-first century is a daunting one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #7:1>
CHAPTER FIVE
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #8:1>
International Statesman
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #9:1>
As befitted a pilot , Rajiv loved to travel and visit other countries during his time as prime minister .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #10:1>
This may have been as much because he wanted to project India on the international stage , as because he enjoyed being his country 's chief diplomat , a role for which he felt his upbringing equipped him well .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #11:1>
When he told those attending a banquet given in his honour by the British prime minister , Mrs Thatcher , during his first visit to London after taking office that &lsquo; it is good to be among friends &rsquo; , he meant it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #12:1>
It was not just memories of his &lsquo; carefree days &rsquo; in London as a student , but the fact that he has been meeting international statespeople in his grandfather 's and mother 's homes for as long as he can remember .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #13:1>
He feels at ease with such people , which is not true of all Indian politicians , and that may explain why he decided to retain the external affairs portfolio for himself in his first government after the elections .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #14:1>
It certainly provided a pretext , if one were needed , for the foreign tours he undertook to fifteen different countries during his first year after being elected to office .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #15:1>
There is a tradition in the subcontinent of watching to see whether a new leader goes first to Moscow or Washington , as an indicator of ideological leanings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #16:1>
When Rajiv came to office , it was suggested he would lean more towards the West because of his fondness for com<l>puters and other electronic gadgetry that is more widely available there .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #17:1>
He was not thought to be as committed to socialism as Nehru or Indira Gandhi were .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #18:1>
As it happened , the decision about his first visit abroad was decided not by Rajiv or the External Affairs Ministry , but in Moscow with the sudden death of the Soviet leader , Konstantin Chernenko , in March 1985 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #19:1>
The funeral necessitated a quick dash to Moscow , where Rajiv was warmly received by the new Soviet leader , Mikhail Gorbachev .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #20:1>
Any remaining doubts about Rajiv 's foreign policy priorities were finally dispelled two months later when he made a fully fledged six-day visit to the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #21:1>
This visit established a special relationship between the reform-minded leaders of both countries , with Rajiv particularly impressed by Mikhail Gorbachev 's apparently genuine commitment to nuclear arms reduction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #22:1>
They were to visit each other regularly after this , and had a total of eight meetings over five years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #23:1>
Rajiv 's strangest visit to Moscow came later the same year when he ordered the jet bringing him back from a six-nation tour , which had included visits to the Commonwealth Conference in the Bahamas and the United Nations General Assembly in New York , to divert to Moscow after his last scheduled stop in the Netherlands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #24:1>
Brief talks were followed by a visit to the ballet by Rajiv and Sonia before they headed home .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #25:1>
This unscheduled stop provoked some consternation in the United States , coming so soon after Rajiv and President Reagan had met at the United Nations in New York , and just a month before the first Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #26:1>
Apart from creating an impression that Rajiv could not meet the American president without straight away reporting back to Moscow , the Moscow stop-over gave rise to worries that he might be giving Mikhail Gorbachev advance information of an American posture at Geneva .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #27:1>
In India , the rushed visit was considered rather unseemly :
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #28:1>
one journalist suggested to the prime minister on his return that &lsquo; normally a prime minister of a country of India 's size doesn't go to another country all of a sudden , and that just after your meeting such a big ... &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #29:1>
The questioner was cut off by Rajiv defending his visit saying the Moscow visit was not entirely unscheduled , just unannounced , but had only become feasible after his stay in New York was cut short .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #30:1>
The mystery remained , but the impression of undue deference to Moscow had been created .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #31:1>
The following year , there was to be another brief unscheduled stop in Moscow on the way back from Mexico , but this time the cause was a technical failure on Rajiv 's aircraft .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #32:1>
Despite the warmth of his relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev , Rajiv would not agree that he or his government were closer to Soviet thinking than to Western .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #33:1>
Whenever it was put to him that India tilted towards the Soviet Union in the great ideological divide , he would quote his mother :
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #34:1>
&lsquo; We are upright ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #35:1>
we don't have a tilt . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #36:1>
When inter<l>viewers persisted and pointed out that India had invariably voted the same way as the Soviet Union at the United Nations and often voted against the United States , he replied by saying that India never voted with or against anyone but for the principles it believed in which , he said , was the meaning of non-alignment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #37:1>
Non-alignment had been the guiding foreign policy principle of Jawaharlal Nehru who , together with Gamel Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia , had been instrumental in the early 1960s in forming the Non-Aligned Movement , which brings together countries which share this ideal of neutrality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #38:1>
The main tenets of non-alignment are that a country is no party to any defence alliance and does not have foreign troops stationed on its soil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #39:1>
In 1983 , Indira Gandhi became the Non-Aligned Move<l>ment 's chairman , and Rajiv Gandhi succeeded her in the post when he became prime minister .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #40:1>
Under successive prime ministers , India had enjoyed a close relation<l>ship with the Soviet Union for more than thirty years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #41:1>
The relationship had been formalised when the two countries signed a Treaty of Peace , Friendship and Co-operation on the eve of India 's third war with Pakistan in 1971 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #42:1>
The relationship was strengthened during the war when a United States aircraft carrier sailed into the Bay of Bengal in threatening posture , an incident that has been cited ever since as justification for India 's determination to keep superpower navies out of the region , and for building up its own naval force .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #43:1>
The Soviet Union is regarded in Delhi as a dependable friend , unlike the United States , which Rajiv has accused of cutting off supplies of military spares and equipment at times of war when they are most needed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #44:1>
The Delhi-Moscow axis is further strengthened by non-military co-operation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #45:1>
Since the early fifties , the Soviet Union has helped India develop its indigenous industrial base and the two nations have become significant trading partners in the process .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #46:1>
However , India 's major trading partner is the United States and , whether to correct the impression of a tilt towards Moscow or not , it was just three weeks after his first substantive visit to Moscow that Rajiv was warmly welcomed in Washington .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #47:1>
He had come to inaug<l>urate one of a series of international cultural festivals of India , but was also afforded the honour of addressing both Houses of Congress .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #48:1>
He reminded members of Congress that India and the United States are the world 's two largest democracies , and raised a cheer when he told them that it was the throwing of Indian tea into Boston harbour during the Boston Tea Party of 1773 that had helped stimulate the American revolution !
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #49:1>
( History had not been a strong point of Rajiv 's at school ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #50:1>
otherwise he would have been able to point out to his speech-writer that tea was not introduced into India from China until the middle of the nineteenth century . )
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #51:1>
Rajiv perhaps best captured the imagination of members of Congress when he told them : &lsquo; India is an old country but a young nation : and like the young everywhere we are impatient .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #52:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #X53:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #54:1>
Rajiv also had a chance to talk with President Reagan after which he told the National Press Club : &lsquo; I think we will get on very well together . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #55:1>
Whilst still in America , a flying visit to Texas in the company of Vice President George Bush gave him the opportunity to develop a relationship with the next president .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #56:1>
Rajiv 's talks with both men covered a range of subjects , including scientific and technological co-operation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #57:1>
Rajiv told President Reagan that India wanted to buy an American super-computer to help predict the onset of Indian monsoons with a high degree of accuracy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #58:1>
The United States had been refusing to supply India with high technology equipment out of a fear that India might use it for military applications .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #59:1>
Worse still , they feared that once in India 's hands the technology would leak out to the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #60:1>
However , at this meeting the American president agreed that India should have the computer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #61:1>
Whether this was an indication that India was henceforth to be taken off the &lsquo; suspicion &rsquo; list or simply a sweetener in the hope that the United States would be well placed when India made up its mind on its defence shopping list , is a matter for speculation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #62:1>
Even so , anyone looking for signs of a &lsquo; tilt &rsquo; will have noticed that it was to the Soviet Union that India turned three years later for help in building nuclear power stations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #63:1>
Rajiv clearly felt as much at ease in Washington as in Moscow , or indeed in London , Paris , Cairo or most of the other capitals that he was to visit during his five years in office .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #64:1>
International hob-nobbing comes easily to him , and not only in the major centres of power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #65:1>
Other countries of which he seems especially fond include less prominent ones like Vietnam and tiny Bhutan ( he made return visits to both ) , Yugoslavia , which he also visited twice , and Indonesia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #66:1>
He recalled visiting both Yugoslavia and Indonesia as a boy with his grandfather and mother , the latter when he was only six years old .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #67:1>
He had not previously visited Bhutan , a tiny Himalayan kingdom which depends on India for a large part of its development budget , but had obviously heard a lot about it from Nehru .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #68:1>
&lsquo; After my grandfather and my mother returned from Bhutan twenty-seven years ago , they told me about their adventurous journey on horse-back and yak-back , and of the picturesqueness of Bhutan 's landscape and its shimmering air , &rsquo; he recalled at a banquet given by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck on his first visit to the kingdom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #69:1>
When visiting a new country , Rajiv often begins his banquet speech by recalling a visit made to that country by Nehru many years ago , and quotes something his grandfather had said or written about that visit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #70:1>
Rajiv likes to speak about common or shared heritages or early links between the country he is visiting and India - of the Buddhism that links India with China and Vietnam , for example , or even when he told a British audience : &lsquo; We in India have long ago forgiven you for ruling over us . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #71:1>
Rajiv may not have been schooled in world history by Nehru , as his mother was , but Nehru was his favourite source of quotations for illustrating his speeches abroad .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #72:1>
His second favourite was &lsquo; our great national poet &rsquo; √≠ , Rabindranath Tagore .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #73:1>
Rajiv 's speech writers were well read or briefed and included , for example , a Turkish proverb when he spoke at a banquet in Ankara , a quotation from Ho Chi Minh at a reception in Hanoi , and one from Dag Hammarskjold in Stockholm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #74:1>
Rajiv 's style on all these foreign trips was not to deal with the specifics of Indian foreign policy , which he left to the professional diplomats &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #75:1>
instead he was much more interested in the broad principles and with campaigning to put right what he considered to be wrong and evil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #76:1>
If he had an overriding international philosophy it could be described as &lsquo; one-worldism &rsquo; , the breaking down of barriers between nations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #77:1>
It is a philosophy he attributes to his mother who , he says , saw herself as an &lsquo; earth citizen &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #78:1>
&lsquo; She rejected the fashionable division of our common earth into the First , Second and Third Worlds , &rsquo; he said , &lsquo; affirming her belief in One World &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #79:1>
That is not a view of his mother 's foreign policy imperatives that would be widely accepted , as Indira Gandhi went out of her way to turn foreign difficulties to her political advantage , the most notable example being her intervention to help Bangladesh break away from Pakistan , an act which won her a great deal of support at home and abroad .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #80:1>
Rajiv may have learnt a lesson from this episode and tried to follow her example when he signed a treaty with Sri Lanka that , as we shall see , was very much to India 's advantage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #81:1>
Less successfully , he searched for a role for India in resolving the Afghan conflict after the Soviet troop withdrawal , without finding one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #82:1>
He certainly emulated both his mother and his grandfather in his commitment to non-alignment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #83:1>
However , he was just as inclined as his mother to see a foreign hand at work - in stirring up unrest in Punjab or Kashmir , behind spy scandals , in association with Opposition parties during the election campaign or in other areas of public life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-011 #84:1>
There was nothing very original in Rajiv 's foreign policy , though his style of personalised diplomacy was his own .

<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #16:1>
One morning towards the end of July we were having a routine meeting in Keith 's room on steel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #17:1>
Norman Tebbit was there and after the meeting was over I walked out with him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #18:1>
We were both going out to lunch and we stood waiting for the lift idly chatting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #19:1>
I said to Norman that the rumour was about that he was going to the Department of Employment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #20:1>
He merely shrugged his shoulders .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #21:1>
If you do , I said , then I will help you sort out the Manpower Services Commission .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #22:1>
Norman merely grinned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #23:1>
I did not go away that August .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #24:1>
There was much to do in the Department and I was also engaged in showing all that ORT could offer in technology training .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #25:1>
I invited both Peter Morrison ( who was Parliamentary Secretary at Employment ) and Kenneth Baker for a presentation by ORT at their offices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #26:1>
My discussions with Sanyo were now hotting up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #27:1>
I was acting as a sort of middleman between Philips and Sanyo with Jim Prior taking an understandably keen interest in all that happened .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #28:1>
Philips were not too keen to sell to a competitor but were aware what this sale could do for jobs in the area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #29:1>
September came and the Department came back to life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #30:1>
It was difficult to get used to the enormous change that came over the Department in August .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #31:1>
During my banking or property days August could be a very busy month indeed
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #32:1>
but in Government , as in the outside world , hardly anything happens .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #33:1>
Parliament would rise at the end of July and all ministers , save the luckless Junior duty Minister , would flee to their homes or get away with their families on holiday .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #34:1>
So would all the senior officials .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #35:1>
On 1 September all the senior Ministers and officials would reappear and we would carry on exactly where we left off a month earlier .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #36:1>
I learned to follow suit , and each future August , I would disappear as well .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #37:1>
One Sunday evening in the middle of September I received a phone call which shook me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #38:1>
Strong rumours were around about a reshuffle due the very next day but my caller was adamant that Keith Joseph was leaving Industry and going to Education and would be replaced by Patrick Jenkin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #39:1>
I had never met Patrick Jenkin and this came to me as a bombshell , for Keith had given no indication that he might be on the move .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #40:1>
My caller insisted that was not so &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #41:1>
Keith had asked to go since he believed that his job at the Department of Industry was done and if more was not done with Education all our work would be wasted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #42:1>
I was frankly incredulous for I had heard no whisper and had no indication from Keith .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #43:1>
The next day carried on as usual .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #44:1>
A reshuffle was certainly on and the story was around that Norman Tebbit was in the Cabinet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #45:1>
That was confirmed when his Private Office was asked by the Cabinet Office to clear 11 a.m. the following Thursday for a meeting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #46:1>
They did not say what sort of meeting but it could only be Cabinet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #47:1>
At the time Norman was waiting for his summons to No. 10 , which duly came .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #48:1>
The day carried on with its usual complement of meetings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #49:1>
At about 4 o'clock Keith Joseph held a meeting on the future of British Telecom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #50:1>
We were agreeing the progress to be made if BT was to be brought to privatisation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #51:1>
Keith took an active interest in the discus<l>sion and mapped out steps to be taken over the next few months .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #52:1>
He was due to go to Japan the next day and was very interested in what made Japanese industry so efficient .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #53:1>
He handled the meeting as if nothing were to change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #54:1>
By then I was sure that he was not going to leave the Department .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #55:1>
The meeting finished at about 5 o'clock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #56:1>
I was about to go when Keith asked me to stay .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #57:1>
He asked to be excused for a moment as he had a letter to finish .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #58:1>
He carried on writing for a few moments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #59:1>
At exactly 5.15 p.m. he looked up and told me that at that very moment the announcement was being made that he was going to the Department of Education and Science
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #60:1>
and would I come with him as his Special Adviser ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #61:1>
In spite of the warning that I had had I was at a loss for words .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #62:1>
I mumbled something to the effect that I was not too sure if I could really help at DES and said that I would be in touch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #63:1>
I asked who his successor would be and he said Patrick Jenkin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #64:1>
I then had to go to a meeting in Kenneth Baker 's room .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #65:1>
During the meeting Kenneth 's Private Secretary handed me a message say<l>ing that I should go immediately to No. 10 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #66:1>
I excused myself and left .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #67:1>
When I got there I was shown into David Wolfson 's room who passed on the request from the Prime Minister that I should con<l>tinue my work in the Department for Patrick Jenkin as his Special Adviser .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #68:1>
He had agreed and I was then introduced to him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #69:1>
We arranged to meet the next morning .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #70:1>
Later that evening Kenneth rang me , full of curiosity , to enquire if I had got a job !
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #71:1>
Norman Lamont came to replace Michael Marshall , the junior Minister , whilst Norman Tebbit duly went to Employment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #72:1>
All the ministers had changed since last Christmas !
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #73:1>
By now I was getting used to the system which was so different from anything I had experienced in the outside world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #74:1>
I had now been in the Department for well over two years , far longer than any of our ministers
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #75:1>
and in many cases I had been dealing with issues longer than the officials themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #76:1>
At the beginning I had come in with a healthy contempt for ministers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #77:1>
They were not managers and in words that John Hoskyns was to use in years to come , I could not see them running even a medium sized multinational .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #78:1>
After a while I developed a healthy respect for them and the system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #79:1>
Time after time they would show that they had the political feel for the possible that I lacked .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #80:1>
They really were the interface between the possible and the people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #81:1>
We were due to go back to collect our boat from Andraitx in Majorca where we had left it in May .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #82:1>
I thought about it overnight and felt that I could not go away for ten days within a few days of acquiring a new master .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #83:1>
I rang Gerry and reluctantly we cancelled the trip .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #84:1>
I never went back .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #85:1>
By the time the next spring came I had other responsibilities and there was never the time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #86:1>
Five years later we sold the boat .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #87:1>
I have never sailed since .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #88:1>
I now started working for Patrick Jenkin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #89:1>
This was a very differ<l>ent experience from working for Keith Joseph .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #90:1>
For one thing I had worked for Keith for years and presumably he only selected me once he was satisfied that he could work with me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #91:1>
Patrick , who had been at Social Security , had me thrust upon him by the Prime Minister at the very moment he was offered the job .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #92:1>
No one refuses in those circumstances !
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #93:1>
Patrick was far more pragmatic than Keith .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #94:1>
But the change that really amazed me was the change in the Department itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #95:1>
Within a few days we had our usual state of the union monthly meeting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #96:1>
All those civil servants who used to speak in an impeccable monetarist dialect suddenly changed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #97:1>
No more did they speak of the impor<l>tance of reducing public expenditure , of containing the money supply , of not allowing the public sector to expand in any circum<l>stances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #98:1>
Instead they went back to where they were in 1979
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #99:1>
and I could see that they were tempting Patrick to be as interventionist and as wet as they could .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #100:1>
Of course there are differences of attitude and approach between different politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #101:1>
I found the changeover a trying time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #102:1>
Policies did change but in the end not as much as I had feared .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #103:1>
I quickly became used to the new regime .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #104:1>
But what I learned from the inci<l>dent is how a department will try to read the mind of a minister in order to provide him with what they think he wants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #105:1>
If a minister is not definite , if he does not lay down clear policy guidelines , then the department will give him what they think is best .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #106:1>
That way lies disaster since policies that emerge from the depths of a department without the political steer of a minister are often a weak compro<l>mise of differing strands within the department .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #107:1>
I learned a great lesson over this incident which I did not forget although I never dreamed that one day I could put it to good use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #108:1>
I became part of a small group under the Prime Minister looking at the problems of Liverpool .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #109:1>
All sorts of remedies were suggested .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #110:1>
Michael Heseltine submitted a paper entitled &lsquo; It took a riot ... &rsquo; and ended up with special responsibilities for the area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #111:1>
The unemployment figures for August were released .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #112:1>
They now exceeded 2,900,000 for the first time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #113:1>
Unemployment had increased by over 400,000 in the last four months alone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #114:1>
The whole idea of unemployment offended me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #115:1>
The waste and the moral degradation of hundreds of thousands of people , the depression and the sense of uselessness that a futile search for employment engendered seemed to me to be against all that we stood for .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #116:1>
All the opposition bleated for , day after day , was for the Government to spend more and more money .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #117:1>
I knew it was not the answer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #118:1>
There is an old saying from the Talmud that continually went through my mind :
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #X119:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #120:1>
All that the opposition would have us do was to hand out more and more fish .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #121:1>
I suspected that the more that people became dependent on the state , the happier the opposition would be .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #122:1>
There was also much concern about school leavers and the Youth Opportunities Scheme was being extended in an effort to help .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #123:1>
I could not help thinking of my experiences in Israel and France and many other countries with ORT .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #124:1>
Wherever I now travelled around the country I would hear complaints about the quality of young people leaving our schools :
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #125:1>
undisciplined , illiterate or innumerate were the mildest criticisms of them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #126:1>
But these very people had all benefited from the longest period of compulsory education in Europe , if not the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #127:1>
But I knew that the fault lay not with our young people but the quality and type of education they had received .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #128:1>
Yet all we were offering was the Youth Opportunities Programme which to my mind was no more than giving a young person the opportunity to watch those in work without training them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #129:1>
If it was ever more than that it tended towards exploitation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #130:1>
The arrangements for the flotation of Cable &ampersand; Wireless were now in full swing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #131:1>
As we got near to the flotation date the market went into decline .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #132:1>
The price was to be settled over the weekend in early November and Kenneth Baker called a meeting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #133:1>
I had received a strong warning from the merchant bankers that it might be diffi<l>cult to place the underwriting in the current state of the market .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #134:1>
This warning is almost traditional on all underwriting , but I was still concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #135:1>
The price was settled and agreed on the Sunday evening .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #136:1>
In view of the market conditions it was at the lower end of the range and the Treasury agreed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #137:1>
The following morning the market improved :
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #138:1>
I was torn between delight and horror .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #139:1>
I watched prices going up day after day for the ten days before the flotation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #140:1>
The issue was a great success but in the Commons we were criticised for setting the price too low .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #141:1>
That was the first time that I discovered the great facility that the Opposition had with the exercise of hindsight !
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #142:1>
In the meantime Keith Joseph had appointed me a part time Special Adviser to him at the Department of Education .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #143:1>
I invited him , together with Sir James Hamilton the Permanent Secretary , over to ORT for a demonstration of the latest in vocational and technical education .
<ICE-GB:W2B-012 #144:1>
I did not think that they would allow the experience of ORT to help his Department , although that would be easily possible , but I wanted to bring to the attention of senior officials and ministers how our educational system differed from those of almost all industrialised nations .

People power
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #3:1>
ALBERT SCHWEITZER
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #4:1>
It is far too late for tinkering with the environment , far too late for putting the sticking plaster below the waterline when what we really need are the life-boats .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #5:1>
When the Titanic is sinking , you don't just rearrange the deckchairs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #6:1>
If the structure of the economic system is the problem then you have to change that structure and allow people to control it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #7:1>
At present it controls the people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #8:1>
To stop this , political and economic power has to be taken from the few at the centre and handed to people in their own local communities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #9:1>
The system of politics and business today is destructive , anti<l->democratic , highly inefficient and takes power from the majority and gives it to the few .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #10:1>
In this way , the control we have over our own lives and environments is constantly eroded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #11:1>
Until this power is given to people in their own communities , they will never have the chance to decide their own destiny .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #12:1>
Someone at the centre will do it for them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #13:1>
First , there is no credible argument left against proportional representation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #14:1>
The opposition to it comes from those politicians who know that if we had real democracy in this country they would no longer win total power with the support of just 32 per cent of the electorate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #15:1>
We don't have democratic elections in this country , we have a sham , a sleight of hand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #16:1>
We can't solve our environmental problems , or any others come to that , until we have a parliament that represents the values and beliefs of all the Population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #17:1>
But that , in itself , is not nearly enough .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #18:1>
If we just elect those people to govern our lives from far away , then apart from being more representative , power would stay with the few at the centre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #19:1>
Handing back the power
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #20:1>
The Green Party would devolve power in a very big way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #21:1>
Every decision that could be made locally would be made locally , every decision after that which could be made regionally would be made by new regional governments , and only those decisions that needed a national response or policy would be made in Westminster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #22:1>
It is a natural human reaction to want to control our own lives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #23:1>
The desire for regional and local autonomy is getting stronger all over the world , especially in the Soviet Union where rule from the centre has been so destructive and unjust .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #24:1>
Local councils would become the key decision-makers with the regions having the power to stop the decisions of one council harming another , and national government in the same way could step in if the decisions of one region were harming another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #25:1>
To emphasise where the power lies , taxes would be collected locally and a proportion handed over to the regions and Westminster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #26:1>
We would transform the approach to govern<l>ment so it was built from the bottom , not dictated from the top .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #27:1>
The Green Party doesn't want power in the sense of taking it all for itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #28:1>
The first thing we would do in government is start the process of handing as much power as possible to the communities where it should really be held .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #29:1>
Once local people were making decisions for themselves , a tremendous amount of destruction would stop immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #30:1>
There would have to be proper discussion and consultation about development in all its forms and referenda would be encouraged on the big issues .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #31:1>
At present governments and councils are elected by a minority of the vote &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #32:1>
then off they go to do what they like until the next election .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #33:1>
We want ongoing public participation so that fundamental changes to communities cannot take place if the people don't want them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #34:1>
In this way we would have conser<l>vation and environmental protection built into the system because communities are not going to allow their areas to be scarred or poisoned if they have more power to stop it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #35:1>
They have to live there , after all .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #36:1>
Every local community would become in effect its own environmental protection agency able to determine what is acceptable and what isn't on environmental grounds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #37:1>
Any disputes would be settled at regional level , not in Westminster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #38:1>
Today decisions are taken by people who do not have to live with the consequences of what they decide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #39:1>
This is why so many bad decisions are made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #40:1>
Why are appalling planning decisions made by central government nearly always opposed by the local MP even if they are a member of the same party ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #41:1>
Because they have to live with the consequences ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #42:1>
the minister doesn't .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #43:1>
Is it any wonder that there is so much apathy about when people have been removed from the real decision-making pro<l>cess for so long ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #44:1>
That apathy can only be removed if people believe that this involvement can have an effect on the outcome .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #45:1>
We would encourage and support the setting up of community and neighbourhood councils so that everyone had the chance to contribute .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #46:1>
People tend to think that because many of the problems are global , the answer must be global .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #47:1>
It is true that we must constantly seek international agreements and ways of enforcing them , but there are so many environmental problems that the main answer lies not in one all-encompassing solution which will never appear , but in all of us taking responsibility for ourselves and our communities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #48:1>
Yes , there must be trans<l>national co-ordination &semi; but only by all of us acting locally , and having the power to do so , can the planet be healed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #49:1>
The cost of big business
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #50:1>
As with government , so with industry and business .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #51:1>
Power and control have moved away from people and been seized by the centre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #52:1>
With every take-over the control over our lives is handed to fewer and fewer people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #53:1>
At present a company wanting to take over another has to show that it is not against the public interest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #54:1>
We would make them show it is in the public interest - and on that basis the number of takeovers would virtually dry up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #55:1>
This is because most takeovers are not in the public interest , but in the interests of shareholders and boards of direc<l>tors or in the name of increased prestige and status .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #56:1>
Frankly , those reasons are not good enough .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #57:1>
These major companies and multi-nationals wield enormous power and control over countries as well as communities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #58:1>
That 's not surprising when you see that the turnover and profits of these companies and corporations are greater than the incomes of many Third World countries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #59:1>
As a result the economies of those countries are run on behalf of the multinationals and not the people , something I will be looking at in more detail later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #60:1>
We would discourage these power blocs in this country with a tax based on company size .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #61:1>
The bigger the company , the bigger the tax , and this would help smaller firms to compete because they wouldn't pay it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #62:1>
It is not a case of small is best whatever the circumstances , but we do want to see a change to more smaller companies and an end to the present trend of a few giants swallowing up the rest and controlling local markets from afar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #63:1>
We do , however , most certainly need international agreement if we are really to curb the abuses of multinational companies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #64:1>
We would use the tax system again to encourage what big organisations there were to devolve their power from the centre to semi-autonomous companies in which employees could take part in decision making .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #65:1>
These large , faceless organisations which control everything by central dictat diktat are often unpleasant to work for and very inefficient because they do not use their greatest asset : the knowledge , experience , and talents of their own workforce .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #66:1>
It 's all too impersonal and distant for these assets to flourish .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #67:1>
Schumacher likened the ideal business structure to a series of balloons all freely floating by themselves with a hand at the centre lightly holding the strings to keep them all together .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #68:1>
You can apply this to all large businesses and to central government .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #69:1>
It is the opposite of rule from above which Green Politics so opposes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #70:1>
The more you centralise production , the more massive lorries you need to deliver that production and the further people have to travel to work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #71:1>
The results of that in pollution and wasted natural resources every year is shameful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #72:1>
The number and size of the lorries and the distances they travel , the number of com<l>muters and the distances they travel have soared because of this centralisation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #73:1>
If much more of the production and distribution were based locally there would be no need for all this waste because there would be no long distances for vehicles or people to travel every day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #74:1>
We would actually be able to spend more time with our husbands , wives , children and friends , something the present system is denying us more and more .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #75:1>
The new communications technology makes this much easier to do .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #76:1>
On the Isle of Wight , we see the ferries unload enormous lorries every hour through the day - and off they go to create traffic problems , choke pedestrians with their cancer-causing fumes , damage roads that were not designed to take them or force the council to widen and repair roads with the com<l>munity's community 's money .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #77:1>
These are just a few of the hidden costs of our &lsquo; efficient &rsquo; centralized production .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #78:1>
What makes it all so ridiculous is that the Isle of Wight could produce most of the things these lorries bring in small scale businesses that would create local employment , end the need for bigger roads and constant repairs , and make it a much more pleasant environment in which to live .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #79:1>
Instead of being dependent on one or two industries as most places are , local production for local need would spread the variety of employ<l>ment , so if an industry closed down or declined it would not destroy the entire local economy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #80:1>
Again it reduces dependency and increases security and control .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #81:1>
There are endless costs that are never added to the debit sheet when companies talk about &lsquo; rationalisation &rsquo; or whatever the latest buzz word may be .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #82:1>
We and the environment pick up the tab for these costs , not the companies
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #83:1>
make it all sound so sensible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #84:1>
&lsquo; If we concentrate our production on one site we save this cost or that cost .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #85:1>
We can increase our profit margins and produce more output . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #86:1>
Jolly good .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #87:1>
Most impressive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #88:1>
But what do this growth and these increased profit margins mean for us as a country and community ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #89:1>
They mean more giant lorries to deliver goods longer and longer distances , and more cars to deliver people longer and longer distances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #90:1>
We see our taxes that could go to much better use being spent on new roads and motorways , the price of which has long since entered cuckoo land and the environmental impact of which is horrendous &semi; we see our city communities torn apart by urban motorways to &lsquo; speed &rsquo; the transit of lorries and com<l>muters to and from their centralised production and adminis<l>tration &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #91:1>
see thousands killed every year in road accidents and many thousands more injured with all the costs to them , their families , and the National Health Service &semi; we see buildings damaged , roads damaged , sewers and water mains damaged &semi; we see our trees dying from acid rain caused by exhaust emis<l>sions &semi; we see all the stress and misery caused by living alongside roads full of heavy lorries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #92:1>
We see more ill-health .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #93:1>
The list goes on and on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #94:1>
We and the planet cannot afford to be this &lsquo; efficient &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #95:1>
You can appreciate what these costs add up to when you consider that one 38 ton lorry does more damage to a road than at least 100,000 cars .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #96:1>
Next time you pass yet more road works remember that you are looking at one of the costs of moving production away from communities and to the centre .
<ICE-GB:W2B-013 #97:1>
These are the costs the grey parties never talk about when they allow this system to go on .

<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #1:1>
Credit for Mrs Thatcher
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #2:1>
TERRY JONES
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #3:1>
Some of the achievements of Mrs Thatcher 's ten years in office are , even now , barely recognised .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #4:1>
I think it is disgraceful , for example , that Mrs T is given so little credit for stamping out the disgusting - not to say dangerous - practice of eating partially cooked or even sometimes raw eggs ( as in foreign confections such as omelettes and mayonnaise ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #5:1>
And yet it is the emphasis which she has placed on commercial gain over and above public safety that has enabled so many of our great egg-producing companies to continue to flourish despite the endemic problem of salmonella contamination .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #6:1>
It is also Mrs Thatcher 's unself<l>ish determination that free enterprise should not be held back by unwelcome exposure to public scrutiny that has allowed the industry to develop some of its most cost-effective techniques , such as feeding dead and diseased hens to healthy ones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #7:1>
Similarly is it right that Mrs T should be denied the credit she is due for weaning an entire generation off drinking tap water ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #8:1>
Those who wish merely to carp and niggle may pretend that it is hardly Margaret Thatcher 's responsibility if people as far away as Cornwall are poisoned by their water or if Londoners wake up one day to find theirs full of worms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #9:1>
And yet if it were not for Mrs Thatcher 's insistence that the 12 water businesses of England and Wales be made economically healthy , the Lowermoor plant would have had someone on duty on the day the aluminium sulphate was dumped into the wrong tank .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #10:1>
What 's more , if the government hadn't encouraged South West Water ( if only by example ) to break the 1983 water strike , keys would never have been handed out to the contractors , and the contractors wouldn't have been able to get in when no one was on duty in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #11:1>
Those who wish to cavil will also probably claim that Margaret Thatcher cannot be given all the credit for our record levels of radioac<l>tivity both at sea and on land .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #12:1>
But even here , I believe , they are being unfair to her .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #13:1>
The Irish Sea and the Cumbrian coast may have been polluted before Mrs T came to power , but it was she who refused to let that fact blunt her enthusiasm for the nuclear industry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #14:1>
In the same way , she may not have been personally responsible for the Chernobyl affair , or for the fact that fallout from Chernobyl has made the hills of Wales and Scotland so radioactive that over 700 farms still cannot sell their meat for human consumption , but it was she who - a mere three years later - was still stoutly defending nuclear power as the most environmentally sound source of energy we have .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #15:1>
When it comes to the greenhouse effect , those who wish to belittle Mrs Thatcher 's contribution will doubtless point to her many public utterances on the subject - particularly her extraordinary appearance at the UN in November of 1989 , when she pledged &pound-sign;5 million million to set up a centre for predicting climatic change and &pound-sign;100 million million to help preserve the tropical rainforests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #16:1>
But they do her a grave disservice , for whatever Mrs T was saying in public , she was , in reality , doing all she could to protect our production of carbon dioxide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #17:1>
She has never wavered in her determination to run down public transport and encourage road traffic - which accounts for almost 20% of all Britain 's CO2 emissions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #18:1>
During her period of office , traffic increased by over 27% , and the Department of Transport now predicts a further increase by the year 2005 of between 83% and 142% , and proposes to encourage this increase by pledging &pound-sign;6 billion to building new roads !
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #19:1>
What 's more , even as Mrs T was making her statement in New York , her representatives at the 72-nation conference in the Netherlands were blocking a proposal to freeze carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #20:1>
So Mrs T has nothing to be ashamed of in her record of defending our CO 2 production .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #21:1>
And so it goes on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #22:1>
The sneerers and jeerers may try to play down Mrs Thatcher 's role in the accomplishments of the last ten years , but her hand has been constantly on the tiller , guiding the ship of state through the stormy seas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #23:1>
Indeed , even some of the most newsworthy events of recent times - Zeebrugge , King 's Cross and Clapham - may all be traced back ultimately to one of her enthusiasms - that public transport should exist first and foremost to make a profit and only secondarily to move people around from A to B in comfort and safety .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #24:1>
So there we are : after ten years of Mrs Thatcher we can't eat eggs and we can't drink tap water .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #25:1>
We can't eat a lot of Welsh or Scottish lamb because it 's radioactive - as is much of the milk supply , 20 miles of Cumbrian coast and the Irish Sea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #26:1>
We can't eat beef that may be contaminated with BSE and cheese that may be full of lysteria .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #27:1>
There is a hole in the ozone layer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #28:1>
The atmosphere is overheating .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #29:1>
Most beaches are unfit for swimming .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #30:1>
London is crammed with people reduced to begging or living in cardboard boxes , while the streets themselves are ankle-deep in litter , the pavements are blocked by plastic bagfuls of uncollected rubbish and the roads are full of potholes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #31:1>
There are fires on the underground , crashes on the railways and disasters on the ferries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #32:1>
There are millions out of work , the poor have no safety net and more young people than ever before commit suicide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #33:1>
After ten years of Mrs Thatcher , the government now openly censors the BBC and tells our teachers what they can and what they cannot teach our children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #34:1>
After ten years of Mrs Thatcher , government in this country is more authoritarian , more centralised and more secretive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #35:1>
The government gags its civil servants who try to blow the whistle on abuses of power , gags scientists who try to reveal dangers to the public ( such as the BSE scandal ) and even gags doctors and nurses who speak openly about what is happening in our hospitals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #36:1>
Ten years of Mrs Thatcher has wiped out the democratically elected metropolitan councils and effectively taken away most of the powers of local government .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #37:1>
Oh yes - and ten years of Mrs Thatcher has wiped out the British film industry !
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #38:1>
So what is the alternative ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #39:1>
Since this book is full of sensible ideas , I thought I would offer up a rather less practical suggestion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #40:1>
I would first like to point out that all these startling achievements over the last decade have been made without an armed struggle and without any seizing of power by force ( apart from abolishing the elected metropolitan councils ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #41:1>
They have all taken place in a modern Western democracy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #42:1>
My question is : is there any point in having a democracy when it can elect and can keep on electing such a ludicrous government as we have had for the last ten years ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #43:1>
If the Tory Party machine can sell someone as unattractive as Mrs Thatcher , and if she can sell a policy as ludicrous as the idea that giving greed its head is the only way to ensure the welfare of the people , then what is our democracy worth ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #44:1>
Modern means of communication now make the manipulation of public opinion possible on a scale that even Goebbels would have found unimaginable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #45:1>
Thus in a modern Western democracy access to or control of the media , especially the TV and the popular press , is the key to power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #46:1>
Policies and politicians are rapidly being reduced to commodities to be sold like lager .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #47:1>
Real politics goes out of the window and the image-makers take over .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #48:1>
It all follows with the inevitability of the night 's TV programmes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #49:1>
Once the Tory Party brought in Saatchi and Saatchi , the Labour Party had to follow suit or go down the pan .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #50:1>
And there is nothing we can do about this situation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #51:1>
We can't abolish TV .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #52:1>
So maybe we need to adapt our democracy to this changed world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #53:1>
And maybe we can learn something from the past .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #54:1>
Six hundred years ago , the definition of a tyrant proposed by certain Italian jurists like Bartolus of Sassoferato and Coluccio Salutati ( and , incidentally , adopted by our own Geoffrey Chaucer ) went something like this :
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #55:1>
it was supposed that a king had the right to rule only as long as he was acting in the interests of his people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #56:1>
As soon as he started acting purely in his own interests he was deemed to have become a tyrant and to have forfeited the right to rule .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #57:1>
Now a king who wields power because his father was king , they reckoned , has a 50% chance of being the right sort of ruler .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #58:1>
On the other hand , a king who gains power because he has actively sought power is almost certain to be acting in his own interests and therefore is 99% certain to be the wrong sort of ruler .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #59:1>
It was therefore preferable , they argued , to make do with an inherited monarch , with an even chance of his being a decent ruler , and to concentrate not on how he achieves power but on how to influence him for the best .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #60:1>
Thus the education of the young prince was regarded as of utmost importance and , when he assumed power , the choice of the king 's council became paramount .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #61:1>
This is why every socially concerned writer from Dante to Chaucer , wrote a Book of Rules for Princes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #62:1>
It was their social duty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #63:1>
According to this medieval theory of kingship , then , those who sought power were automatically ruled out , and the political focus was concentrated on methods of educating , influencing and gaining access to the ruler , who was selected by the relatively arbitrary method of succession .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #64:1>
In some ways this was more advanced than what happens today .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #65:1>
Nowadays , we are allowed to choose once every five years between one set of power-seeking politicians and another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #66:1>
The voter has precious little control over the choice of candidates ( although Labour has begun to make some efforts in this direction ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #67:1>
Once those who have sought power are in power they have virtual carte blanche to do as they like , and to bulldoze through the demonstrably unpopular policies ( such as the abolition of the GLC and the privatisation of water ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #68:1>
Clearly , the medieval ideal I have outlined didn't actually work , since by the next century Italy itself was overrun with tyrants , and Machiavelli had come up with his own Book of Rules for Princes which was , in fact , a Handbook for Tyrants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #69:1>
But maybe the concepts of avoiding giving power to those who seek power and of focusing political activity on the access of ordinary people to those in power are concepts that we should try to absorb into our democracy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #70:1>
So , as this is a book of alternatives , here 's my suggestion for an alternative democracy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #71:1>
How about abolishing elected governments as such , and make serving in the government more like jury service ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #72:1>
Once a year 12 people could be randomly selected from the electoral register , and they would be given the power that we now invest in professional self-serving politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #73:1>
We are happy to give a randomly selected jury power over the life or death of individuals , so why not give a similarly randomly selected panel power over the nation ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #74:1>
The rest of us could carry on voting for the professional politicians who would initiate policies , who would advise and who would canvass ideas , but they would be denied ultimate power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #75:1>
Ultimate power would lie with the jury of 12 randomly selected good men and true .
<ICE-GB:W2B-014 #76:1>
For my part , I would sooner trust myself and the nation to the good sense of a randomly selected jury ( such as the one that freed Clive Ponting ) than any set of professional power-seekers who have made Britain the place it has become in the last ten years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #X1:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #X2:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #X3:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #4:1>
In the first week of May 1988 William Millinship , the then managing editor of the Observer , took me aside - it was on the pinky-grey editorial floor of the paper 's new building over Chelsea Bridge - and spoke to me with unaccustomed force , even severity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #5:1>
Did I realise , he asked , that I was about to be sued for libel in the Queen 's Bench Division of the High Court and that the action was set down to begin on Monday , 16 May ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #6:1>
Did I further understand that the proceedings might last a week or even longer ( the estimate given to me later , as a matter of fact , was 10 days ) , that they would prove gruelling and that I would be compelled to give evidence subject to cross-examination ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #7:1>
He appreciated , he went on , that my &lsquo; style &rsquo; was , as he put it , &lsquo; laid back &rsquo; : but there was a limit beyond which casualness was transformed into irresponsibility .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #8:1>
Mr Millinship did not actually utter the last words .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #9:1>
But the implication , what libel lawyers call the innuendo , was there &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #10:1>
and it was more or less justified .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #11:1>
Would I therefore , he concluded , be kind enough to telephone David O'Callaghan , of Turner Kenneth Brown , the Observer 's solicitors ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #12:1>
Mr 0'Callaghan was anxious to take down my &lsquo; proof of evidence &rsquo; , which is the witness 's statement to his solicitor of what he intends to say in court , and forms the basis of the barrister 's examination-in-chief .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #13:1>
( In Michael Meacher 's action against Donald Trelford , The Observer Ltd and me , Mr Meacher 's proof assumed a possibly crucial importance . )
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #14:1>
I accordingly telephoned Mr 0'Callaghan and arranged to call on him at his firm 's spacious offices in Fetter Lane , all potted plants and haughty girls carrying files , and more reminiscent of an American television series than of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #15:1>
Mr O'Callaghan and his team
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #16:1>
I had met Mr O'Callaghan before , though I had not been to his offices until 10 May .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #17:1>
We had attended several conferences in 1987-8 at the chambers of Richard Hartley , QC , at 1 Brick Court , Temple , in the company of Stephen Nathan , Mr Hartley 's junior , and of Anthony Howard , the Observer 's then deputy editor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #18:1>
We had corresponded frequently over &lsquo; this bloody Meacher business &rsquo; , as I tended to call it , or &lsquo; this wretched affair &rsquo; , as Mr Howard preferred to describe it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #19:1>
Mr O'Callaghan was the son of an Army NCO and had been educated at Farnham Grammar School .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #20:1>
His father had been a champion bantam-weight boxer and Mr O'Callaghan himself - sandy , square , with a large nose and a slight puffiness around the upper cheeks and the eyes - had something of the pugilist about his demeanour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #21:1>
The eyes themselves were particularly menacing , of an intense blue .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #22:1>
I caught them once when giving evidence and always tried to look elsewhere afterwards , even though his personal friendliness and helpfulness were overwhelming .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #23:1>
As the case progressed my admiration for the intelligence , resource and , above all , resilience of Mr O'Callaghan grew .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #24:1>
I was similarly impressed by his young articled clerk , Paul Fox , by Monique Bonville-Ginn and by Marion Tudholpe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #25:1>
Indeed , if it had not been for the intensely hard work done by the four of them on Mr Meacher 's family background ( work whose thoroughness put most journalists to shame ) , the case could not have been fought as effectively as it was .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #26:1>
The work was not completed until 11 o'clock on Friday 13 May , two days before the case was due to start .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #27:1>
Most of it was done on that day and on the days immediately preceding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #28:1>
Mr O'Callaghan told me afterwards that he had never worked so hard in his life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #29:1>
The implication was that he had not really expected the case to come on at all .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #30:1>
I certainly did not expect it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #31:1>
When I took my place in Court No. 14 on the first day I thought I was having a dream or sitting in the front row of the stalls for a performance of One Way Pendulum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #32:1>
Mr Howard experienced similar feelings of dissociation from reality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #33:1>
We had both thought that the bloody business or wretched affair would be settled somehow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #34:1>
Mr Mill<l>inship perhaps saw more clearly than either of us that Mr Meacher , his solicitors or both were determined to have a fight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #35:1>
Reading for libel
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #36:1>
In 1985 the Observer had no &lsquo; in-house &rsquo; lawyer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #37:1>
Perhaps this was odd , though it did not strike me so at the time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #38:1>
But in my days on the Sunday Express , 1959-64 , Express Newspapers had a legal manager with an office and secretarial staff .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #39:1>
When I wrote a political column for the Sunday Mirror in 1968-9 there was a legal manager employed by the group .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #40:1>
Indeed , at a meeting chaired by Sir Edward Pickering and attended by various other grave gentlemen in suits , this particular legal person had insisted that I apologise to Reginald Maudling for some animadversions of mine concerning Maudling 's connection with Jerome Hoffman and the Real Estate Fund of America . 1
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #41:1>
1 See Michael Gillard , A Little Pot of Money ( 1974 ) , 150 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #42:1>
He had said firmly that , without wishing to be offensive , if a London jury had to choose between Maudling and me , they would unfailingly prefer the Conservative politician .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #43:1>
In 1985 , when the letter from Mr Meacher 's solicitors arrived , Mr Millinship was the Observer 's legal manager .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #44:1>
The paper was then &lsquo; read for libel &rsquo; on Friday and Saturday by several young barristers who came in under a rota system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #45:1>
There was also a senior libel barrister .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #46:1>
When I started on the Observer in 1976 this was Alec Grant , an old acquaintance of mine from university Labour politics , and an old friend of Mr Howard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #47:1>
Mr Grant left to become a High Court Master .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #48:1>
Oddly enough I enjoyed an easier relationship with Mr Grant 's effective successor , Mr Nathan , who was of a younger generation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #49:1>
He had been at New College with my friend Geoffrey Wheatcroft and was dark , somewhat Italian in appearance , with quick , brown eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #50:1>
Occasionally he would proffer advice , I would decline it , he would insist and I would go off to the editor , Mr Trelford , who would almost always support me .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #51:1>
Mr Nathan would look petulant and flounce a little ( Nigel Lawson often wore a similar expression when thwarted ) but he bore no ill-will .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #52:1>
These infrequent disagreements tended to arise over charges by me of dishonesty or untruthfulness in a politician .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #53:1>
Mr Trelford had a more robust approach : &lsquo; not defamatory &rsquo; , &lsquo; fair comment &rsquo; or , more frequently , &lsquo; he ( or she ) wouldn't dare to sue &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #54:1>
One of his favourite maxims was that only trivial or possible libels were argued about strenuously in newspaper offices - that the really serious ones slipped through .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #55:1>
This was certainly so in the case of Meacher v Trelford and Others .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #56:1>
No one raised any alarm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #57:1>
Mr Nathan was a skilled newspaper lawyer , besides being an accomplished barrister .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #58:1>
Indeed , it is arguable that , if anyone won the case for us , it was Mr Nathan .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #59:1>
It was he who spotted the action of Gordon Bishop , counsel for the plaintiff , when he put Mr Meacher 's &lsquo; proof of evidence &rsquo; before the court .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #60:1>
This led to the recall and extended cross-examination of Mr Meacher .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #61:1>
This episode will be dealt with later , in its proper place .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #62:1>
We are now at the pre-trial stage , with Mr Nathan in his role of the Observer 's principal weekend lawyer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #63:1>
Political journalists ' privilege
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #64:1>
Political journalists , I should explain , enjoy an unofficially privileged position in relation to the law of libel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #65:1>
They enjoy it irrespective of whether they are political columnists , lobby correspondents or parliamentary sketch-writers - since the arrival of the incomparable Frank Johnson and , later , Edward Pearce , the most derisive group of the three .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #66:1>
They occupy this protected place because of custom and practice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #67:1>
The practice varies from politician to politician and , indeed , from administration to administration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #68:1>
Harold Wilson was not averse to securing the dispatch of a minatory letter from Lord Goodman , the greatest solicitor since Cicero .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #69:1>
But Edward Heath prohibited members of his administration from having recourse to the law at all in matters of defamation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #70:1>
Nevertheless the prudent political journalist will avoid those words which remain legally incandescent , such as &lsquo; fraud &rsquo; , &lsquo; cheat &rsquo; , &lsquo; liar &rsquo; and &lsquo; coward &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #71:1>
&lsquo; Hack &rsquo; , was established as being similarly perilous when in October 1956 Randolph Churchill successfully sued the People for so describing him and was awarded &pound-sign;5,000 as a consequence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #72:1>
But the word has since been devalued for purposes of litigation by its constant use in Private Eye .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #73:1>
Where politicians lose most heavily , however , is in their vulnerability to suggestions that they are bad at their jobs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #74:1>
An imputation of incompetence in one 's trade or profession is regarded as highly defamatory .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #75:1>
Journalists are particularly prone to rush off to their solicitors if someone says they are past it or were never up to it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #76:1>
However , critical journalists , of the theatre , the cinema , television or whatever , enjoy some latitude .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #77:1>
They do so partly because of the available defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest ( provided the defence is not destroyed by malice ) and partly also because of custom and practice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #78:1>
In reality the courts recognise that the work of a critic cannot be carried on properly , or at all , unless he or she is free to write that a performer is no good .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #79:1>
The case of Charlotte Cornwell 's shape and Nina Myskow 's comments on it in the News of the World diverted many onlookers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #80:1>
The contrast between the treatment of actors and performers on the one hand , and businessmen and financiers on the other , could hardly be greater .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #81:1>
The most respected financial journalists in the most reputable newspapers can easily find themselves , or their papers , liable for &pound-sign;50,000 or so owing to an incorrect forecast , a misplaced zero or merely an unhappy choice of phrase .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #82:1>
Politicians are regarded - indeed , regard themselves - as being closer to actors and Performers than to businessmen and financiers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #83:1>
In some respects , in fact , they are treated worse than actors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #84:1>
In 1966-7 , for example , there was a cry that Douglas Jay was a &lsquo; bad &rsquo; President of the Board of Trade .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #85:1>
Mr ( later Lord ) Jay was uninspiring , an embodiment of the privations of the 1940s under the Attlee government .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #86:1>
But he was both intelligent and industrious .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #87:1>
One of his principal political beliefs was that Britain should not join the Common Market .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #88:1>
The bulk of the press thought we should join , especially the Mirror papers , which were also the most persistent in their questioning of Mr Jay 's competence as a Minister .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #89:1>
As the Wilson government 's policy towards Europe had changed in 1966 , it is arguable that Mr Jay should have been moved from the Board of Trade instead of being dismissed in the following year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #90:1>
Yet he did not , as far as I know , contemplate any legal action to impede this campaign of denigration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #91:1>
It was regarded by everyone as part of the rough-and-tumble of political life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #92:1>
Some case studies
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #93:1>
Sometimes , however , politicians do sue .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #94:1>
In 1946 Harold Laski sued the Newark Advertiser for stating that he advocated revolution by violence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #95:1>
Though a scholar , he was also active in Labour politics , being chairman of the National Executive Committee in 1945 , and one of the first of numerous Labour bogeymen that have made comet-like appearances in our newspapers , from Laski , John Strachey and Aneurin Bevan to , more recently , Tony Benn , Arthur Scargill , Ken Livingstone and Bernie Grant .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #96:1>
The Daily Express was pursuing Laski with special zeal and , though the first defendant was the local paper , the other real defendant was the Express , which had picked up the offending words and featured them prominently .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #97:1>
They were extracted from Laski ( though their precise form was always in dispute ) in an altercation with James Wentworth Day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #98:1>
Day was a Conservative journalist who cultivated a jaunty and picturesque appearance and wrote chiefly on farming matters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #99:1>
At the meeting in Newark market square , however , he was present as an &lsquo; adviser &rsquo; to Conservative candidates in the region .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #100:1>
On this occasion he seems to have behaved more as an agent provocateur .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #101:1>
In the cross-examination of Laski by Sir Patrick Hastings , the question at issue became not what he had actually said at the meeting but what he had written on the subject .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #102:1>
Understandably , he had written a great deal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #103:1>
Did saying that revolution was inevitable also mean that one was advocating it ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #104:1>
Laski 's replies were , equally understandably , honest but involved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #105:1>
The jury found for the defendants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-015 #106:1>
Laski had a bill of costs of around &pound-sign;13,000 .

Nationalization -
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #2:1>
the Years of Disillusionment
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #X3:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #X4:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #5:1>
JOHN MOORE , Secretary of State for Transport
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #6:1>
In the latter days of 1966 the Iron &ampersand; Steel Nationalization Bill was being guided through parliament by the Secretary of State for Energy , the Right Honourable Richard Marsh .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #7:1>
I was appointed head of the Transport &ampersand; Shipping operations of the newly emerg<l>ing British Steel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #8:1>
That year saw the second attempt to nationalize British Steel , the first attempt being reversed by the incoming Conservative Party in 1955 before it could be implemented .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #9:1>
As with all nationalizations , it created a huge managerial challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #10:1>
It meant the takeover and integration of the fourteen major steel makers in the UK .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #11:1>
It required the setting up of a management and financial structure which would enable the future rationaliz<l>ation of the industry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #12:1>
Above all , it needed a vision of the future which would unite management and workers to give them a sense of belonging to an enterprise that had challenge , inspiration and a sense of purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #13:1>
To formulate such a vision , and to drive it into practice , British Steel needed a leader of great intellect , charisma and communication skills .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #14:1>
He had to unite towards a common pur<l>pose all the proud private companies who were to form the new industry &semi; and who , given a free choice , did not want to be united .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #15:1>
In fact , they had all campaigned hard against the proposed nationalization .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #16:1>
This stance was somewhat hypocritical , as for many years , indeed ever since the war , all the major investment decisions in the industry had been agreed by , and , in the main , financed by , government .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #17:1>
There was also a government-approved Federation of the industry which controlled most of the pricing , marketing and purchasing activities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #18:1>
Having accepted over the years this level of government intervention and market manipulation , it really should not have been such a steep hill to climb to accept state ownership and management .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #19:1>
It would have been better if the future leader of British Steel could have been found from within the industry , but , because of their vocal opposition to nationalization , the natural leaders in the industry virtually disqualified themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #20:1>
It is always a problem for a Labour government to find top businessmen to carry out the monumental management tasks that nationaliz<l>ation demands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #21:1>
After a protracted search the choice fell on the relatively youthful Lord Melchett .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #22:1>
His background was in merchant banking , and , whilst his grandfather had been an industrial colossus forging by takeover and merger the great ICI , Julian Melchett had no such experience of industry , restructuring or rationalizing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #23:1>
His early death long before the task was complete was a tragedy , as he was an able , popular and good man .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #24:1>
From the beginning , in order to obtain some level of co<l->operation from the barons of the industry , Melchett had to compromise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #25:1>
When BSC was first formed , the organization was initially based upon the old company loyalties .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #26:1>
This clearly could not last , as the old company structure had no logic once owner<l>ship had changed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #27:1>
It did not make sense to have the basic iron and strip steel production in separate groups .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #28:1>
In the four years I was there , there were to be two more reorganizations &semi; the first production based , the next partially market based .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #29:1>
Reorganization is not a good thing for any business .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #30:1>
At times it is obviously necessary , but in deciding on a particular organiz<l>ation , the aim should be that it remains relevant for at least five years - and preferably longer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #31:1>
Not one of the reorganizations that I witnessed in BSC had the chance of meeting this criterion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #32:1>
They were expedient compromises made with a view to placating particular vested interests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #33:1>
Any reorganization is disruptive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #34:1>
It makes key management take their eye off the only ball that should ever be in play - the satisfaction of the customer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #35:1>
It produces in-plays in which each individual seeks to find for himself a role and to ensure that when the new cards are dealt , he gets the hand he wants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #36:1>
It is also usually accompanied by an examination of the level of delegation that can be given to each new layer of management , and only rarely does this actually lead to an increase in the level of local autonomy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #37:1>
In the three attempts at settling the long-term organization that I witnessed in British Steel , there was never any increase in the level of local autonomy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #38:1>
I am not a great reader of books on management theory .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #39:1>
I prefer to read the biographies of businessmen who have per<l>formed and from them draw my own management lessons .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #40:1>
An early hero of mine was Robert Townsend , who revitalized the Avis company and who wrote a good account of it in a book called Up the Organization .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #41:1>
One of the central themes of his business practice was to allow more freedom to operating companies , to get rid of central departments and their associated costs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #42:1>
As I sat in the centre of the new British Steel , it was like a nightmare reversal of all the precepts which he had so amusingly preached .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #43:1>
In short order , the executive jets started to arrive &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #44:1>
millions were spent on revamping the London headquarters to standards of luxury unbecoming to a hardly profitable business &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #45:1>
the public relations and advertising departments were afforded priority status -
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #46:1>
countless millions were spent upon trying to increase the use of steel through television and media advertising , a campaign more appropriate to a consumer product than a base material . .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #47:1>
Furthermore , the political and corporate strategists assembled in sizeable numbers , and a large personnel department headed by a recruit from the Trade Union movement was an early priority .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #48:1>
It was hardly surprising that from being a profitable business at the time of nationalization , British Steel became hugely unprofitable and a constant drain on the public purse throughout the 1970s , at one time losing more than &pound-sign;1m per day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #49:1>
It was a time of seeming euphoria .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #50:1>
Countless working parties were formed to plan the expansion of existing capacity and the development of green field sites to satisfy the ever-increasing estimates of the demand for steel worldwide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #51:1>
All these grandiose plans were to founder as the worldwide demand for steel col<l>lapsed in the wake of the successive oil crises in the 1970s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #52:1>
Growth-based corporate plans were presented to government - the banker - and argued over interminably , while smaller , more necessary capital projects were being delayed because the vision for the industry could not be agreed upon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #53:1>
What had happened , I wondered , to the principles and central purpose of nationalization - the creation of a strategically-important business , operated for the public interest and creating harmony in the workforce ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #54:1>
Industrial relations were seen as a top-down process , rather than - as they should be - bottom up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #55:1>
Work hard at getting things right between management and workers at the places of production , and harmony will flow upwards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #56:1>
The role of the centre is to create a climate in which good industrial relations practices can flourish in the operating unit - not to try and dictate what those practices should be .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #57:1>
Having learnt nothing , it seemed to me , from the failures of previous nationalizations , British Steel went down the time-dishonoured route of top-down initiatives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #58:1>
Strong national trade-union leaders met with the central personnel team , including the Chairman and other board members .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #59:1>
Negotiations were conducted almost exclusively at this level .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #60:1>
National agreements were entered into with enthusi<l>asm , but they had little relevance to the individual steel works .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #61:1>
I am sure that Sir Robert Scholey , the current Chairman of British Steel who has made such a conspicuous success of the human relations and profitability of the business in the 1980s , would judge that one of the milestones in his recovery pro<l>gramme was when he put wage and productivity bargaining back to plant level .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #62:1>
This is where it should have been , and this should have been part of the vision of the new British Steel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #63:1>
Regrettably it wasn't .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #64:1>
Perhaps in the industrial and political climate of the day it wasn't possible - but I doubt whether it was even recognized at the time as being something important to strive for .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #65:1>
Much time and effort was spent on board structures - experi<l>ments
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #66:1>
experiments were tried with worker-directors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #67:1>
They failed because it was almost impossible to define their role , particularly as it was clear that they represented no one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #68:1>
They were not elected by their fellow workers - nor even appointed by their trade unions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #69:1>
So British Steel developed , as had many of the earlier national<l>ized industries , into a prime example of conflict between manage<l>ment and labour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #70:1>
There was little evidence of management and workers trying in harmony to create an enterprise to serve the nation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #71:1>
Nationalization had merely taken the ownership and ultimate control away from private investors , and had passed it on to the politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #72:1>
Government ministers are so ephemeral that as ever the role of ownership came to rest in the unwilling hands of the Civil Servants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #73:1>
The division I joined was Transport &ampersand; Shipping , and it was headed by an enthusiastic , driving and enjoyable man called Bill Menzies-Wilson .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #74:1>
He encouraged enterprise , was participative up to a point , had a touch of the autocrat when needed , but , above all , he wanted to get improvements through action .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #75:1>
He was another man who was better respected by those who worked for him than those above , whose political manoeuvrings he found hard to live with .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #76:1>
He left BSC shortly after I did to tackle the problems of the redirection of the Ocean Shipping Group , which he did with no little success .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #77:1>
We have remained friends ever since , and today he is on the board of NFC as an independent director .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #78:1>
&lsquo; Independent &rsquo; aptly describes the stance he has always taken .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #79:1>
The tasks that faced the Transport &ampersand; Shipping Group which I headed were challenging and important .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #80:1>
We calculated that BSC spent something in excess of &pound-sign;2OOm a year just moving around raw materials and finished products .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #81:1>
In fact , there was no shortage of savings to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #82:1>
At the simplest level , we found by comparing the road haulage rate schedules of the various works that for essentially the same job , one works could be paying fifty per cent higher charges than another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #83:1>
As a result of the simple act of publishing a league table , it was surprising how quickly the worst performers started to move up the batting order .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #84:1>
When I arrived , there were no fewer than six schemes being canvassed for building deep-water ports for the importation of iron ore .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #85:1>
Everyone knew that the deep-water port was a sprat to catch a mackerel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #86:1>
The cost of assembling raw materials for the blast furnace was a significant part of the total cost of making iron .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #87:1>
Every works pitching to have its iron and steel-making facilities upgraded knew it would steal a march if it had a local deep-water port at which to berth the super ore carriers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #88:1>
We painstakingly evaluated every scheme , built computer models to analyse the data and simulate the operations , and concluded that the UK needs for raw material imports could be handled from two deep-water ports .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #89:1>
The political in-fighting against this rec<l>ommendation was a new experience in my business life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #90:1>
In the end I am afraid politics not economics won , and it was finally decided to build four - two more than were actually needed , even to this day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #91:1>
Similar battles were being fought on other aspects of transport and shipping .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #92:1>
Some we won :
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #93:1>
for example , a standardized mineral-<l>carrying rail wagon was agreed on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #94:1>
Some we half won &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #95:1>
the operation of the shipping fleet was rationalized .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #96:1>
Others we lost -
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #97:1>
we failed to develop a sensible policy for controlling the export of steel and directing it through specialist ports .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #98:1>
But it was a busy time and as a central department we were at least able to draw up a cost-benefit analysis of our work and to demonstrate that we had certainly saved BSC large sums of money .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #99:1>
The work was rewarding and we were an enthusiastic team , but there was little emotional satisfaction from observing how minimally the newly-formed BSC was fulfilling its wider responsibility either in its attitude towards its workforce , or in the strategic context of the interests of the nation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #100:1>
It seemed to have learnt nothing from the past failures of other nationalized industries , and it was hard to distinguish any sense of social purpose in the decisions which were being taken .
<ICE-GB:W2B-016 #101:1>
I felt I now wanted to move on and to see if some of the lessons I had learnt along the way could be applied to a business where I was actually accountable for its total success .

<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #2:1>
Defining Child Abuse
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #3:1>
THE NEED FOR DEFINITIONS
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #4:1>
Social workers have a responsibility to protect children from harm and to promote children 's welfare .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #5:1>
In order that they can carry out this role , some generally agreed notions about what is and is not acceptable behaviour towards children must be arrived at and written down .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #6:1>
This must be the case , for how else would it be possible to differentiate between those situations which require intervention and those which do not ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #7:1>
The local authority social worker has to exercise his authority on behalf of the community which employs him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #8:1>
Ideally , the social worker 's opinion as to what constitutes the abuse of children would be shared by the community in general .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #9:1>
If no attempt were made to describe the abuse of children and to set out the parameters of &lsquo; good enough parenting &rsquo; , the social worker would be left to conduct his investigations in a vacuum , and would be ill informed about the level of care which the community would describe as being acceptable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #10:1>
Very often in the past , notions about acceptable standards of child care have been debated in the wake of the latest child abuse tragedy to hit the headlines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #11:1>
Then , often for weeks afterwards , many commentators displaying varying degrees of insight and judgement flood the popular debate with their own versions of where to draw the elusive line between inaction and intervention .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #12:1>
Sometimes it appears as if social workers cannot win in the eyes of the public , no matter what they do .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #13:1>
If they adopt a so-called &lsquo; passive &rsquo; approach and decide , after assessing the degree of risk , to allow a child to remain at home , they can be severely criticised for their inaction if a tragedy subsequently occurs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #14:1>
If social workers are seen to adopt a hard line approach and remove children from home without the benefit of indisputable evidence of actual abuse , they can be severely criticised at a later date for being heavy handed if it transpires that the grounds for their concern were ill founded and that they made a genuine error of judgement .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #15:1>
I am not attempting to justify all actions by social workers in the field of child protection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #16:1>
Quite clearly , bad decisions are sometimes made with serious and occasionally tragic con<l>sequences for the children and families concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #17:1>
My point is that social workers can often be left feeling quite isolated , having to take on too much responsibility for making up the rules as they go along .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #18:1>
In my view , this is not a legitimate role for social workers to play .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #19:1>
Professional judgement will always play a part in making difficult decisions about child abuse , but this judgement must be seen to operate within commonly accepted boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #20:1>
A similar relationship between professional responsibility and the public expression of what is and is not acceptable operates within the law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #21:1>
Although this relationship is a complex one , there is a sense in which public debate informs the legislature about the need for laws and about how far individual freedoms should be allowed to extend before they need to be curtailed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #22:1>
Although it is the lawyers ' function to interpret the rules in individual cases , the rules themselves are often based upon commonly shared principles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #23:1>
If they are not , the law can in some cases be changed in recognition of the fact that it no longer reflects public opinion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #24:1>
When sections of society feel that the law is unfair , pressure group activity plays a significant part in terms of legal reform .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #25:1>
It is in the area of commonly shared principles that some of the main problems regarding the establishment of definitions of child abuse occur .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #26:1>
As we shall discover , the concept of child abuse is an extremely elusive one and means different things to different people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #27:1>
It is hard to imagine a time when social workers will be assisted by more than the most general statements aimed at defining abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #28:1>
They will always be placed in circumstances where they have to make their own judgements about a very wide range of issues , only marginally informed by public opinion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #29:1>
Why is it that public debate tends to intensify when a child abuse tragedy occurs , and what are the implications for social workers ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #30:1>
The simple answer to the first question is that the detail of media reporting so horrifies the public that the subject is forced into public awareness to a degree which makes it a topic of intense conversation for a while .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #31:1>
We all like to pride ourselves on the care which we lavish on our children , so , why is child abuse not an issue of popular debate , other than around the times of extensive media coverage ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #32:1>
I think that the abuse of children is such an emotive and unsavoury activity to contemplate that we all have a need to minimise , or ignore it as much as we possibly can .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #33:1>
Even today , when the extent of the problem is slowly becoming more apparent , the debate often seems to be conducted only after the latest incident .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #34:1>
This has serious implications for the support which social workers can expect to receive from the general public .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #35:1>
Firstly , many tragedies and crises reported by the media document errors of judgement and episodes of bad practice on the part of the &lsquo; caring professions &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #36:1>
As the local authority social worker is usually the professional with the main legal responsibility to protect children , the bulk of any criticism is aimed at him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #37:1>
The general public can be forgiven , therefore , for assuming that social workers are incapable of adequately carrying out their child protection duties .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #38:1>
This creates a climate of unease and mistrust , leading social workers to be reticent about their role , allowing conjecture and assumption to play a leading part in any analysis of the social worker 's job .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #39:1>
Another implication of the reactive nature of the popular child abuse debate is that it concentrates the public perception on the more obviously serious aspects of child abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #40:1>
This can be extremely misleading in terms of reflecting reality , and is another source of public disquiet about the social worker 's role .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #41:1>
The popular view of child abuse used to relate to the physical injury of young people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #42:1>
Visions of youngsters with severe bruising , broken limbs and battered bodies would be conjured up whenever this subject was mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #43:1>
It is that much easier to ignore less dramatic injuries to children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #44:1>
The subject of sexual abuse , which has only very recently been brought to the public 's attention , can be seen in the same way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #45:1>
For many , child sexual abuse would mean sexual intercourse with children &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #46:1>
in fact , it has a much broader definition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #47:1>
Physical neglect of children , and in particular emotional abuse , are other forms of abuse that are more difficult to understand and define than physical assault .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #48:1>
This means that the social worker will often have difficulty in putting over to the public his role in cases which do not fall towards the &lsquo; very serious &rsquo; end of abusing situations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #49:1>
Social workers will argue , quite rightly , that it is extremely dangerous to ascribe degrees of severity to episodes of abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #50:1>
Some incidents , which at first glance might appear to be less potentially harmful , do carry implications for children that are just as damaging as other , more obviously serious cases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #51:1>
Social workers need to be guided by the communities in which they work so that they reflect widely shared values of what is reasonable behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #52:1>
Definitions are important , and need to reflect as accurately as possible the consensus of opinion about what constitutes abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #53:1>
As we begin to examine some of the commonly quoted definitions which are prevalent at the moment , I shall endeavour to refer back to the issues I have raised in order to emphasise the difficulties created by the task of defining child abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #54:1>
PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #55:1>
Child abuse is without doubt a major issue of public debate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #56:1>
This must be welcomed because an increasing public aware<l>ness of the subject can only help the process of detection and prevention .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #57:1>
However , the subject of child abuse is an extremely complicated one and the public debate is often confused and littered with myths , half truths and bits of knowledge (
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #58:1>
see Mayhall &ampersand; Norgard - Bibliography ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #59:1>
Although there are a variety of possible reasons for this confusion , a key factor is the problem of definition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #60:1>
We all have a view about the acceptable limits of a relationship between an adult and a child .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #61:1>
We could all distinguish between justifiable discipline and physical ill<l->treatment , between physical affection and sexual assault , but how would our &lsquo; boundaries &rsquo; compare with those of other people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #62:1>
For example , if I were to say that , as part of my role as father to my children , I regularly slap them across the face if they refuse to do as I tell them , would that constitute physical abuse ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #63:1>
Some readers might say &lsquo; yes &rsquo; , without question .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #64:1>
Others may decide that it definitely was not abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #65:1>
I would guess that the majority would be unable to answer the question , given the limits of the information available .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #66:1>
Other questions would need to be asked .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #67:1>
How hard do I hit them ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #68:1>
How often ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #69:1>
How badly do the children have to behave before they are hit ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #70:1>
Even if all these questions and more could be answered , I believe that it would be an impossible task to achieve complete agreement as to whether or not my children were being abused .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #71:1>
Why are definitions so difficult ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #72:1>
Our Own Experiences
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #73:1>
Undoubtedly , the experiences which we have in our own childhood , our interaction with our own parents or guardians , influence the way in which we view the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #74:1>
If , for example , a person is brought up in a household where it is common practice for all the men and boys to have crew cut hairstyles , this might have implications for the way in which they would deal with their own family .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #75:1>
The reaction might be to carry on the family tradition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #76:1>
It might appear odd or unusual to outsiders , but not to those who have been brought up in that way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #77:1>
Alternatively , they might rebel and become violently opposed to short hair , refusing to allow their children to get their hair cut .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #78:1>
Again , this could be a perfectly valid reaction to past experiences , which could none the less seem strange to the outside world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #79:1>
Thirdly , the person could be unmoved by his early experiences , and his decisions as a parent not influenced at all .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #80:1>
Early experiences are significant across the whole range of human behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #81:1>
When we examined the question of whether I was abusing my own children , we came to conclusions based , in part at least , upon what had been our experiences of family discipline in the past .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #82:1>
Given that we all have very different experiences , it is safe to assume that , for a whole range of subjects , our views will differ from those of friends and neighbours .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #83:1>
All of this is true in relation to the topic of child abuse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #84:1>
An adult who has been abused , in whatever way , is likely to let that experience influence his or her own parenting practices , and the way in which the practices of other people are viewed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #85:1>
A female who has been sexually abused by babysitters is likely to have particular views about leaving her own children with babysitters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #86:1>
She might refuse to allow it , and never trust anyone with her children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #87:1>
She might have been so damaged by her own experiences that she is unable to think about protecting other children - &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #88:1>
No one protected me , so why should I care ? &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #89:1>
Those who had parents who slapped their faces if they misbehaved would have been making judgements about my behaviour which were influenced by their own childhood memories .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #90:1>
Perhaps for some , past experiences influenced their opinion more than an analysis of the behaviour in question .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #91:1>
I think you will agree that one of the reasons why it is difficult to formulate definitions of abuse is that our reactions toward human behaviour are influenced by elements other than the behaviour itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-017 #92:1>
Definitions cannot reflect a wide variety of experiences and personal perceptions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #1:1>
Latin America
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #2:1>
The population of Latin America which stood at 164 million in 1950 and more than doubled by 1980 to 364 million , is projected to increase to 566 million by the year 2000 and further to 865 in 2025 before stabilizing eventually at 1.19 thousand million in the year 2100 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #3:1>
The continued growth of population in the continent of Latin America will be a result of relatively low levels of fertility and a &lsquo; young &rsquo; age structure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #4:1>
Consequently the rates of population growth are likely to remain high , 2.3 per cent per annum ( i.e. population doubling time of 30 years ) during most of the present century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #5:1>
Latin America is the most urbanized of all the less developing regions with 65 per cent of its total population residing in the urban areas , rising to roughly three-quarters by the year 2000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #6:1>
Mexico
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #7:1>
Until now we have been a rural planet in which most of mankind has lived closed close to the land and to nature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #8:1>
By the end of the century we will be transformed into an urban planet which will be mainly man-made and include 3 thousand million people competing for limited space in its towns and cities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #9:1>
Nowhere is the growth of population more evident than in cities and by the year 2000 nowhere will there be a city equal in size to Mexico City .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #10:1>
In 1930 Mexico City covered an area of 200 square kilometres &semi; 40 years later its surface area had more than trebled to 650 square kilometres , now it exceeds 800 square kilometres .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #11:1>
Its population , just over one million in 1930 , trebled in size to 3 million in 1950 and by 1980 had increased fivefold to 15 million
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #12:1>
Mexico City is currently growing twice as fast as the population of Mexico and by the year 2000 is projected to reach a population of 26 million .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #13:1>
An urban agglomeration of this size is beyond present human experience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #14:1>
The &lsquo; mere &rsquo; doubling of Mexico City 's population in the past decade has resulted in serious air pollution ( reported to be at five times the maximum safety limit ) water and housing shortages and chronic traffic congestion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #15:1>
More than half of Mexico City 's residents live in slums and shanty towns , many of which lack running water , sanitary facilities and electricity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #16:1>
Unemployment is high , especially among the under-24 age group .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #17:1>
Some 2 million children have no school to attend and half of those who do , leave school before the end of their sixth year of education .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #18:1>
As for the next two decades ...
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #19:1>
As recently as 1972 the Mexican government did not view rapid population growth as an obstacle to soical social and economic development despite an accelerating growth rate that had swelled the country 's population from 20 million in 1940 to 54 million in 1972 ( 84 million in 1988 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #20:1>
Consequently the announcement of a national family planning programme later in that year appeared as an about-turn from the government 's longstanding pro-natalist position , embodied in the 1947 General Population Law , the objective of which was to stimulate the growth of the country 's population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #21:1>
A new General Population Law was enacted in 1973 stressing the right of parents to make responsible decisions about the size of the family they wished to have and the obligation of the government to make the means available to couples carrying out these decisions of programme evaluation , education , supervision and training - in particular the training of auxiliary nurses in rural health centres .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #22:1>
Since the 1973 Population Law was enacted the rate of population growth in Mexico has decreased from 3.5 per cent to 2.6 per cent - as of mid 1981 Mexico had , indeed , achieved her target for 1982 one year ahead of schedule .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #23:1>
The average family size in Mexico has fallen from 7.1 children per woman in 1967-69 to 6.2 per woman in 1973-78 to 4 children per woman in 1988 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #24:1>
It remains to be seen if the momentum achieved by the National Family Planning Plan can be maintained , and efforts doubled and even trebled , particularly in rural areas in order to bring this last figure down to the two-child average necessary to achieve the government 's current goal of 1 per cent of population growth by the year 2000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #25:1>
During the years 1955 to 1975 the population of Mexico nearly doubled .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #26:1>
Yet , despite this , Mexico experienced substantial social and economic progress : a 72 per cent increase in the proportion of primary schoolchildren actually attending school &semi; a 26 per cent increase in literacy &semi; an 89 per cent increase in per capita income at constant prices &semi; and a 27 per cent rise in the average expectation of life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #27:1>
These figures reveal the error of assuming that rapid population growth will automatically lead to impoverishment , but they also show that social and economic development does not automatically lead to a decline in the rate of population growth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #28:1>
Mexico is one , among a growing number of countries , that has recognized that its measures to influence population - creation of jobs , fairer distribution of income , restructuring of its agricultural sector and its primary health care , and its migration policies - will not in themselves be sufficient to stop women becoming pregnant !
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #29:1>
This recognition is a hopeful sign in a country where Roman Catholics comprise 96 per cent of the total population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #30:1>
Europe and other Developed Regions
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #31:1>
A striking feature of the population profile of the more developed countries during the latter part of the twentieth century has been the continuous deceleration in the rate of population growth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #32:1>
Despite this deceleration the population of the developed countries increased from 832 million in 1950 to 1.17 thousand million in 1985 and is projected to increase to 1.27 thousand million by the year 2000 before eventually stabilizing at 1.3 billion in the year 2080 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #33:1>
As a result of steep declines in the level of fertility in most of the developed countries in the past 10 to 20 years , many individual nations are experiencing levels of fertility which are lower than ever recorded , or even below the level of replacement .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #34:1>
Consequently , one important population issue that is confronting some developed countries relates to the question of how nations will respond to the prospect of zero or negative population growth over the decades ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #35:1>
Eleven developed countries have now reached , or are very close to zero population growth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #36:1>
First across the line was East Germany in 1969 followed by West Germany in 1972 , Luxembourg in 1974 , and Austria in 1976 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #37:1>
Today Czechoslovakia &semi; , the United Kingdom , Belgium , Denmark , Hungary &semi; , Norway and Sweden are all hovering around zero population growth , soon to be joined if present trends continue by Finland , Bulgaria , Greece , Italy and Switzerland in about 1990 and by France and Holland towards the end of the millennium .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #38:1>
The United States and Japan are not far behind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #39:1>
United Kingdom
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #40:1>
One consequence of reducing population growth is that there is liable , for a time , to be an increased proportion of old people - a consequence perceived by some as imposing an excessive burden on the rest of the population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #41:1>
But this element of the situation is often overdramatized , ignoring the fact that while it is true that a decrease in the birth rate will augment the population of old people in the total population , an increasing birth rate will augment both the absolute number , and the proportion , of children , thus leading to an at least equal increase in the total dependent population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #42:1>
There is , in fact , no rational basis for the fear of an &lsquo; ageing population &rsquo; - a quite recently sighted bogeyman of certain economists and sociologists .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #43:1>
Children , as well as old people , have to be supported by people of working age and are just as much a &lsquo; burden &rsquo; on society .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #44:1>
The number of old people in Britain will rise until the 90s then fall slightly , and probably rise again early next century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #45:1>
But to suggest adding the burden of more children as well - not to mention yet more old people in 60 to 70 years ' time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #46:1>
A rough measure of dependency is the ratio of the number of those people of pensionable age and those under the age of 16 to the population of working age .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #47:1>
Total dependency is lower for a lower birth rate ( given unchanging death rates for each age group ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #48:1>
Even if , as the birth rate falls , the percentage of the elderly increase increases at first , their numbers can be assessed well in advance and planned for accordingly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #49:1>
On the other hand the financial burden on society of extra children is considerable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #50:1>
Their needs differ from those of the older generation , but they cost no less .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #51:1>
Whereas the old incur high costs in pensions , and residential and medical care , the young incur the costs of education , mother-and-child health services and residential child care .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #52:1>
Bearing in mind that many retired people can still contribute usefully to society , it seems probable that the burden of a dependent child is , overall , at least as high as that of a retired person .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #53:1>
If the birth rate were to be lower still than it is at the moment , the dependency ratio would also be lower , due to the smaller number of children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #54:1>
Later , if the same birth rate were maintained , the ratio of children to adults would rise again as fewer individuals reached working age .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #55:1>
We should take the long view :
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #56:1>
once a more or less stable population at a lower size were achieved , the number of old people in the population would also stabilize at a perfectly normal proportion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #57:1>
To conclude : the fear of an overwhelming burden of old people is one of the least defensible arguments used to advocate an increase in the birth rate for the United Kingdom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #58:1>
It should finally be remembered that this argument is deployed in an economic setting in which unemployment has , since 1957 , risen tenfold to its present official total of 2,000,000 and where over-manning is estimated in millions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #59:1>
It seems illogical to argue that a lower birth rate will not produce enough economically active people in the future when there are not enough jobs for those wanting employment now .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #60:1>
The effect of the continuing fall in the number of children born per family will be to increase the material standard of living to those children that are born .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #61:1>
But even more important , it will greatly increase the non-material standard of living - sometimes referred to as the &lsquo; quality of life &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #62:1>
The International Perspective :
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #63:1>
The United Kingdom shares the surface of the planet with the whole community of mankind and the issues of development , population , resources and the environment constitute inter-related problems - that can only be solved internationally .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #64:1>
We are now more than ever aware that we live in a world where events that happen in one part affect people who live in another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #65:1>
A dramatic example of this inter-relationship was the oil crisis of 1973 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #66:1>
The oil producers of the world raised the price of oil to consumers fivefold within a single year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #67:1>
This sudden action rocked the economies of the industrialized nations and led to a world recession .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #68:1>
Food :
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #69:1>
Despite the substantial increase in home agricultural production since 1945 , the United Kingdom shopping basket is filled , in cost terms , with 45 per cent of foreign food .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #70:1>
In nutritional terms imported cereal and other staple foods account for 36 per cent of what we require .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #71:1>
Material Resources :
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #72:1>
A country like the United Kingdom where every person will eat on average 1 1/2 - 3 times as much , consume 40 times the amount of fossil fuel and industrial products , and use 100 times as many cars , items of household equipment and paper as a person born in one of the less developed countries of the world can ill afford to point the finger of accusation at such countries on the grounds that their population growth is too high .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #73:1>
It is also a fact that other than coal and offshore gas and oil , the United Kingdom has relatively slender material resources of its own and must rely on the export of manufactured goods and the provision of services to pay for food and basic materials .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #74:1>
The great increase in population that Britain was able to sustain in the late 18th and 19th centuries was dependent on two vital and intercon<l>nected factors : industrialization , and colonization of vast new lands abroad .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #75:1>
These new lands were able to provide the food and raw materials she required , and these she was able to import on the most favourable terms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #76:1>
Because of her industrial lead : she could provide the technology and services the rest of the world wanted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #77:1>
But these two elements have now been transformed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #78:1>
First , these overseas territories now have growing ( food-demanding ) populations of their own .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #79:1>
The second factor is , that as other nations industrialized , Britain began to lose her favoured position .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #80:1>
She began to have difficulty in paying for her imports .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #81:1>
Today we call it a &lsquo; balance of payments &rsquo; problem .
<ICE-GB:W2B-018 #82:1>
With the loss of the British Empire and the special world privileges that buffered her against price rises and a decline in real wages , Britain is now exposed to the penalties normally incurred when population outstrips resources .

<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #2:1>
PRISON AND POPLARISM
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #3:1>
In September 1921 , the British newspapers gave prominence to one story -
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #4:1>
Lansbury was in Brixton prison .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #5:1>
Not just him but also most of his fellow Labour councillors from the Poplar borough council .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #6:1>
Poplar had become the centre of a struggle which gave rise to a new political term - Poplarism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #7:1>
The meaning of &lsquo; Poplarism &rsquo; depended on the values of the people who used it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #8:1>
To some it meant Labour Guardians and councillors needlessly spending public money on luxuries for the undeserving poor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #9:1>
To others , it meant elected working-class representatives using the system to protect citizens from the worst effects of poverty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #10:1>
A.J.P. Taylor stated , &lsquo; Poplarism became the name for any defiance by local ( Labour ) councils of the central government . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #11:1>
Poplar , as one of the most poverty-stricken boroughs in London , attracted the attention of Beatrice and Sydney Sidney Webb in 1914 . 2
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #12:1>
Unemployment was common among its population of 160,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #13:1>
The borough lacked heavy industry but contained many small factories , workshops and sweatshops .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #14:1>
Consequently , even those citizens in jobs tended to be unskilled , unorganized and badly paid .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #15:1>
From 1914 , the war took many men and women out of unemployment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #16:1>
However , at its close , returning soldiers and sailors found anything but a land &lsquo; fit for heroes &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #17:1>
After a short-lived post-war boom , unemployment began to rise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #18:1>
The needy might be dealt with by three bodies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #19:1>
Ex-servicemen and their dependants often qualified for allowances from the new Ministry of Pensions which had none of the stigma of the Poor Law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #20:1>
The dependants of officers received about double that of other ranks .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #21:1>
In Poplar , the wives and children were predominantly from the other ranks and their allowances were barely sufficient to take them out of poverty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #22:1>
Some other workers had claim to national insurance schemes whose coverage had been extended in 1920 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #23:1>
Unfortunately , payments were at a low level and the scheme was not designed to deal with long-term unemployment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #24:1>
For those without other means of support , there remained the Poor Law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #25:1>
All the inhabitants suffered further from inflation and rising prices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #26:1>
Many also experienced the dampness , inadequate sanitation and overcrowding frequently found in the dwellings which they rented from private landlords .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #27:1>
Father St John Groser , who started his ministry in Poplar in 1922 , described parents bravely struggling to survive in accommodation in which a density of two persons per room was common and six a room not unknown . 3
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #28:1>
Not surprisingly , the socially depriving conditions had an adverse effect on children .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #29:1>
The gallant school teacher Clara Grant , who spent a lifetime working and living in the East End , identified the outcomes for children : unfulfilled potential at school &semi; vulnerability to illnesses and diseases of all kinds , including TB &semi; and a child death rate much higher than in most other local authority areas . 4
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #30:1>
Much of the responsibility for the relief of destitution and the provision of services rested with the Board of Guardians and the borough council .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #31:1>
For the first time , the Labour Party was in full control for , in the elections of 1919 , it gained fifteen out of twenty-four of the Guardian places and thirty-nine out of forty-two seats of the borough council .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #32:1>
Lansbury became Poplar 's first Labour mayor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #33:1>
Predominantly working class , the Guardians and councillors ( and some individuals were both Guardians and councillors ) determined to improve conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #34:1>
The Royal Commission of Housing of 1917 had stated that &lsquo; most of the troubles we have been investigating are due to the failure of private enterprise to provide and maintain the necessary houses , sufficient in quantity and quality &rsquo; . 5
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #35:1>
Socialists saw the answer as councils building for people not profit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #36:1>
Within two months of becoming mayor , Lansbury cut the first piece of turf at the site of a council housing scheme on the Isle of Dogs and further schemes became a feature of the borough 's work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #37:1>
Within two years , Poplar , along with other Labour councils , established a four pounds-a-week minimum wage for its employees , including equal pay for women .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #38:1>
The councillors were particularly concerned about the effect on poor families of the high prices and shortage of milk and coal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #39:1>
On 23 December 1919 , Lansbury led a deputation of London councillors to the prime minister , Lloyd George .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #40:1>
Lansbury explained that not only were some families going short of milk and fuel but that also boroughs such as Poplar could hardly fulfil their duties to supply milk to young children and expectant and nursing mothers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #41:1>
When the prime minister replied that the free market system of demand and supply would eventually adjust prices so as to be in reach of all , a councillor retorted that most milk supplies in East London were controlled by one large combine which set its own prices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #42:1>
The argument became so heated that Lloyd George warned the councillors to be civil or to get out .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #43:1>
The meeting achieved little but it did contain two ingredients which were to dominate the politics of councils like Poplar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #44:1>
Their rateable values did not generate sufficient income to run adequate services for their needy populations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #45:1>
This disparity was leading them into conflict with central bodies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #46:1>
In 1920 , the National Unemployed Workers ' Movement ( NUWM ) was formed by unemployed persons .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #47:1>
One of its main leaders , the communist Wal Hannington , later recorded an account of their marches and the pressure they put on bodies responsible for administering relief . 6
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #48:1>
Lansbury welcomed such pressure and , in the Herald , encouraged the workless to approach Guardians for out-relief - and out-relief set at adequate levels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #49:1>
The Poplar Guardians then found themselves facing large crowds outside their office - demanding relief .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #50:1>
Lansbury was neither afraid nor resentful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #51:1>
He hated poverty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #52:1>
He saw daily ill-nourished children and distraught parents who had parted with children they could not afford to feed and clothe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #53:1>
He preferred poor people to be angry rather than apathetic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #54:1>
Subject to pressure of this kind , a number of Boards of Guardians asked advice of the Ministry of Health , now the central government department responsible for the Poor Law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #55:1>
Should they extend out-relief or receive more families into what were still known as the workhouses ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #56:1>
The ministry felt that to allow ex-servicemen , as many of the unemployed and destitute were , to enter the workhouses would fuel public discontent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #57:1>
It therefore cited Article 12 of the Relief Regulation Order of 1912 which permitted out-door relief , under certain conditions , even to those whose existing insurance benefits were too low .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #58:1>
The green light was lit and the Poplar Guardians in particular began to administer widespread out-relief .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #59:1>
In a period of six months , Poplar 's expenditure on out-relief doubled to &pound-sign;80,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #60:1>
Local expenditure had to come from local rates .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #61:1>
The problem was that Poplar was a poor borough .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #62:1>
Postgate explains that Poplar had a rateable value of only &pound-sign;947,109 so that a penny rate produced &pound-sign;3,647 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #63:1>
By contrast , Westminster , with far fewer poor residents , had a rateable value of &pound-sign;7,913,53 which produced &pound-sign;31,719 . 7
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #64:1>
To finance more out-relief , Poplar would have provoked the fierce opposition of the Municipal Alliance party but would also have weighed heavily on low-wage families who did pay rates .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #65:1>
The borough council was trapped .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #66:1>
Poplar , in common with other London boroughs , paid levies or precepts to the London County Council , the Metropolitan Police , the Asylums Board and the Water Board for services administered throughout London .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #67:1>
Poplar 's share of about &pound-sign;270,000 was included in the rates paid by householders .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #68:1>
Lansbury recorded : &lsquo; We met as a Labour Party to try and discover what to do . &rsquo; 8
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #69:1>
At this meeting , which included Labour Guardians as well as Labour councillors , the injustice of the precepts system was raised .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #70:1>
It was pointed out that they were not levied according to ability to pay , so that rich and poor boroughs might pay the same amount .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #71:1>
Poplar , therefore , was contributing towards the costs of rich boroughs for certain common services but there was no similar pooling to help with poor relief costs which bore most heavily on Poplar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #72:1>
It was agreed that Poplar should refuse to collect and pay that part of the rate accounting for the common services .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #73:1>
The objective was two-fold : to press for an &lsquo; equalization of the rates &rsquo; scheme so that rich boroughs contributed to poor ones and to draw national attention to the problem of local government finance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #74:1>
The intention to break the law predictably provoked fury amongst the Municipal Alliance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #75:1>
It also drew fire from some Labour figures , especially Herbert Morrison , secretary of the London Labour Party , who argued that Labour 's reputation would be damaged .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #76:1>
Lansbury replied , in the Herald , that &lsquo; The question is not whether what we are doing is legal or illegal , but whether it is right or wrong &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #77:1>
He added that Conservatives had broken the law by taking up arms in Ulster whereas the illegality he advocated was within a framework of non-violence . 9
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #78:1>
In March 1921 , the Poplar council refused its legal obligation to pay precepts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #79:1>
The LCC took legal action and in July the High Court ordered the councillors to pay .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #80:1>
The Labour members declined and in September were jailed for contempt of court .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #81:1>
Among those sent to Brixton Prison were Lansbury , his son Edgar and two close friends , Charlie Sumner and John Scurr .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #82:1>
Five women councillors went to Holloway Prison including Julia Scurr and Minnie Lansbury .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #83:1>
George , now in his sixties , soon fell ill , but he refused to go to hospital .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #84:1>
He was encouraged by crowds of unemployed people who gathered to sing outside and , within a few minutes , the whole prison was ringing with the strains of the Red Flag .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #85:1>
Lansbury raised himself up and was able to address the throng through his cell window .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #86:1>
The government grew uneasy about the imprisonment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #87:1>
Apart from large demonstrations by the unemployed , other London boroughs were threatening to withhold their precepts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #88:1>
More generally , the Labour Party had won a number of by-elections since 1918 and seemed to be increasing its popularity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #89:1>
Sir Alfred Mond , who became minister of health in April l92l , wanted a settlement .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #90:1>
After six weeks , the LCC asked the High Court to release the prisoners on the grounds that they were now willing to negotiate a settlement .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #91:1>
They were thus freed despite not agreeing to pay .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #92:1>
The prisoners had agreed to attend a London-wide conference to sort out the issue of precepts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #93:1>
More important , Mond carried through the London Authorities ( Financial Provision ) Act of l921 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #94:1>
While not giving complete equalization of rates , it did mean that out-door relief and some indoor expenses were to be shared through a common fund levied on all the boroughs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #95:1>
Lansbury was well pleased :
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #X96:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #97:1>
The new act also empowered the minister to draw up scales of outdoor relief as a guide to the London area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #98:1>
The Mond scale allowed twenty-five shillings for a man and wife , six shillings for the first child , five shillings for the second and third , and four shillings for others .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #99:1>
It was an improvement on the payments of some unions but still inadequate in that no specific provision was made for rent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #100:1>
When the Poplar Guardians applied it , local demonstrations were organized by the Workers ' Socialist Federation which regarded Lansbury and the Labour Party as too moderate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #101:1>
On one occasion , its supporters surrounded the Guardians in their office , where Lansbury cheerfully accepted his second &lsquo; imprisonment &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #102:1>
Whether due to this pressure or not , the Guardians agreed to more generous rates knowing that Poplar no longer had to foot the full bill .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #103:1>
Further , some Guardians were reluctant to apply the means test .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #104:1>
As Mrs Julia Scurr explained , working-class Guardians knew how their neighbours were suffering and were &lsquo; ashamed to offer the people the amount we offer &rsquo; , and did not want to knock off a few shillings because a means test revealed that a son was delivering groceries for a local shop . 11
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #105:1>
The tactics of the Poplar Guardians , which were followed by some other socialist Boards of Guardians , brought forth a torrent of criticism and abuse from politicians and press .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #106:1>
They were accused of wasting public money and encouraging idlers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #107:1>
So strong was the language that Lansbury later stated that one of the reasons for writing My Life , published in 1928 , was &lsquo; to refute the misrepresentation of their activities &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #108:1>
The crescendo of condemnation led the minister of health to appoint H.I. Cooper , an old-style clerk , to the Bolton Guardians , to inquire into the Poplar practices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #109:1>
Cooper interviewed nobody , but his report in 1922 still reproached the Poplar Board for departing from the spirit of the Poor Law and suggested that it could save &pound-sign;100,000 a year by reducing the amount spent on out-relief and on food in the workhouse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #110:1>
The Guardians responded with a pamphlet , Guilty and Proud of It .
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #111:1>
Father Groser , in recording these events , noted that the pamphlet was prefaced by a biblical text from James 1 : 27 , which read : &lsquo; Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #112:1>
He added that : &lsquo; the thing which first struck me forcibly on coming to Poplar was the essentially religious nature of the revolt which was taking place &rsquo; . 13
<ICE-GB:W2B-019 #113:1>
Whether for socialist or Christian reasons , or a combination of both , most Poplar Guardians put their duty to be generous to neighbours above their obligation to keep to the letter of the Poor Law regulations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #1:1>
CHAPTER 14
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #2:1>
The criminal law
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #3:1>
1
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #4:1>
THE QUESTION OF GUILT
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #5:1>
For a long time the general approach of the English courts has been to apply a uniform and consistent standard to all those who are accused of criminal offences , regardless of whether or not they have foreign origins .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #6:1>
The purpose of the criminal law is to impose certain minimum standards of behaviour which the community as a whole regards as necessary for the peaceful order of society .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #7:1>
It is therefore logical to apply , in the vast majority of circumstances , a universal set of principles to determine who is guilty and who is innocent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #8:1>
In a case in 1852 involving French defendants who were on a murder charge the judge stated - &lsquo; To make a difference in the case of foreigners would be a most dangerous practice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #X9:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #X10:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #11:1>
This general principle of uniformity will thus apply to most crimes , such as offences against persons ( including murder , assault , kidnapping , carrying of<l>fensive weapons and sexual offences ) and offences against property ( such as burglary and theft ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #12:1>
It also applies to offences such as corruption and the misuse of drugs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #13:1>
The fact that the accused was ignorant of the rules of English law will not afford any defence , nor will it be relevant that the conduct in question would have been perfectly lawful if it had occurted occurred in the accused 's country of origin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #14:1>
For example , female circumcision and the tattooing of children are both lawful in parts of Asia but they are statutory offences under English law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #15:1>
Two cases may be described to illustrate the application of the basic rule about guilt .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #16:1>
In R v Ahmed Shah Moied ( 1987 ) each of the accused had organised or participated in the abduction and detention of a 20 year old girl , Zahida .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #17:1>
She had left the family home in Southampton to study in Chelmsford and had formed an association with a white youth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #18:1>
The girl 's father had thereupon sought the advice of a local community leader of Pakistani origin as to what steps to take and he had then recruited a private detective to snatch the girl from her lodgings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #19:1>
All three of them were found guilty on charges of kidnapping or &lsquo; false imprison<l>ment &rsquo; ( wrongful detention ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #20:1>
In R v Husseyin Ozdemir ( 1986 ) a police officer had caught the accused 's son ( aged 14 ) driving a car and had indicated to the accused that the son would be charged with an offence for driving without a licence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #21:1>
The father , who owned a Turkish restaurant , responded by offering the policeman &pound-sign;50 if he would forget about the case .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #22:1>
When that failed he said - &lsquo; Please , he 's my son
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #23:1>
The police officer reported this incident to his senior officers and the accused was charged with corruption .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #24:1>
He was convicted and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #25:1>
Would a Sikh who carried a kirpan ( religious dagger ) be guilty of possession of a dangerous weapon ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #26:1>
The kirpan is recognised as one of the five distinctive symbols of Sikhism and the carrying of kirpans is expressly recognised as lawful by the Indian Constitu<l>tion , so it is hardly likely that the mere act of carrying one in England would amount to a criminal offence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #27:1>
The Criminal Justice Act 1988 which contains provisions designed to penalise those who carry knives and other sharply pointed articles specifically states that it is a defence for an accused to prove that he had the article with him in a public place for &lsquo; religious reasons &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #28:1>
Of course , if it were proved that a Sikh was carrying a kirpan in a public place with the intention of attacking another person , a criminal offence would have been committed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #29:1>
The accused would be guilty of being in possession of an &lsquo; offensive weapon &rsquo; under the Prevention of Crime Act 1969 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #30:1>
Would a Muslim who married two wives in England be guilty of the crime of bigamy ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #31:1>
Yes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #32:1>
It would be no defence for him to argue that under Muslim law he was entitled to have up to four wives at the same time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #33:1>
Polygamy is not permitted in England .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #34:1>
However , if his first marriage took place outside the UK in a country where polygamy was permitted and if it was recognised as valid in the eyes of English law , then it would not be bigamy for him to marry a second wife in England .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #35:1>
The second &lsquo; marriage &rsquo; would be &lsquo; void &rsquo; and ineffective but no criminal charges would follow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #36:1>
This is because the English courts have decided that the crime of bigamy depends upon the first marriage being a monogamous one in legal terms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #37:1>
What would be the position if a Muslim married his first wife in England and his second wife in , say , Pakistan ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #38:1>
Since the first marriage was monogamous in the eyes of English law a charge of bigamy might be brought if the husband later returned to England .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #39:1>
However , the law is unclear on this point and there is no reported case in which such a prosecution has been attempted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #40:1>
2
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #41:1>
THE DISCRETION TO PROSECUTE
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #42:1>
Most prosecutions are now decided upon by the Crown Prosecution Service , whereas formerly most were laid by the police .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #43:1>
The prosecuting authorities have a discretion as to whether or not to press charges in any particular case .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #44:1>
Sometimes they may consider that they only need to &lsquo; caution &rsquo; an offender and warn him not to repeat the action concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #45:1>
There are many factors which the authorities are entitled to take into account in reaching their decision , such as the chances of the suspect being convicted and whether the breach of the law was of merely a trivial or technical nature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #46:1>
&lsquo; Cautions &rsquo; are now quite common in cases where people are in breach of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 through merely possessing very small quantities of cannabis for their own personal use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #47:1>
However , anyone caught importing or supplying large quantities of the drug to others will invariably be prosecuted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #48:1>
Possession of certain other more danger<l>ous drugs such as cocaine and heroin is very likely to result in prosecution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #49:1>
Kat ( or ghat ) , sometimes known as &lsquo; Arabian tea &rsquo; and widely chewed in the Middle East and East Africa is not , however , on the banned list and may be freely imported and used in Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #50:1>
3
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #51:1>
THE PROCESS OF SENTENCING
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #52:1>
Once an accused person has been convicted of an offence , the court has to decide upon the appropriate punishment or sentence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #53:1>
There are a variety of choices open to the court including fines , probation and &lsquo; community service orders &rsquo; , as well as committal to a period of imprisonment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #54:1>
Many factors have to be considered including the gravity of the crime , the harm done and the circum<l>stances and personality of the defendant .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #55:1>
When the question of sentence ( as opposed to the issue of guilt ) arises , it is right and proper that the court should be made aware of such matters as the defendant 's foreign origins , ignorance of English law , adherence to ethnic or religious customs and traditions , and difficulty in adjusting to English standards of behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #56:1>
Any of these matters may serve as &lsquo; mitigating circumstances &rsquo; reducing the defendant 's moral respon<l>sibility and thus calling for a degree of leniency in fixing the appropriate sentence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #57:1>
A good example of such leniency being shown is provided by the case of R v Bashir Begum Bibi ( 1980 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #58:1>
The defendant was a Kenyan Asian widow , aged 48 , who had been found guilty of being involved in the import of
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #59:1>
cannabis , contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #60:1>
During the proceedings the report of a social worker revealed that she had been totally dependent for her support and welfare on her brother-in-law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #61:1>
It was he who had organised the illegal importing of the drugs and he had already been convicted and sentenced to three and a half years ' imprisonment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #62:1>
The widow had merely unpacked the parcels of cannabis when they arrived at her home from Kenya and she was clearly only on the fringes of the enterprise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #63:1>
She was so well socialised into the Muslim traditions of purdah and male dominance that the Court felt it was unlikely that she really appreciated the significance of what she had done .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #64:1>
She had had no contact with wider English society and her involvement in the offence appeared to arise out of a normal response of simply accepting the decisions made by her male relations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #65:1>
The sentence of three years ' imprisonment imposed upon her by the Crown Court was therefore reduced by the Court of Appeal to one of six months .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #66:1>
This was felt to be more appropriate for both the offence and the offender and it meant her immediate release from the gaol where she had already spent six months in custody .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #67:1>
A further illustration of a lenient sentence being imposed by the court is the case of R v Sughran Bibi ( 1989 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #68:1>
The defendant had been ordered to attend at Leeds Crown Court to give evidence for the prosecution in a fraud trial .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #69:1>
Her husband told her not to attend and as a result the trial was impeded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #70:1>
The judge held that this amounted to &lsquo; contempt of court &rsquo; and that she could not rely on her duty to obey her husband as a defence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #71:1>
Instead she had to obey English law .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #72:1>
However , in choosing the appropriate sentence to pass he took account of her cultural background and fined her &pound-sign;250 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #73:1>
The judge expressly stated that if she had been a member of the majority community he would have been much more severe and almost certainly sent her to prison .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #75:1>
SPECIFIC RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #76:1>
In three specific areas Parliament has created exemptions from liability under the general criminal law in order to accommodate the religious practices of minority groups .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #77:1>
This means that only members of the religious community concerned are free from criminal responsibility &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #78:1>
others will still be guilty of the relevant offence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #79:1>
( a ) Motorcyclists and crash helmets
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #80:1>
Regulations made by the Minister of Transport under the Road Traffic Act 1972 require motorcyclists to wear helmets complying with high safety standards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #81:1>
Failure to do so is a criminal offence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #82:1>
Following a vigorous public campaign by Sikhs and their supporters , Parliament passed legislation in 1976 to accom<l>modate the needs of those Sikhs who wear turbans .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #83:1>
The Motor-Cycle Crash Helmets ( Religious Exemption ) Act 1976 provides that any requirement im<l>posed now or later by regulations under the 1972 Act shall not apply to any follower of the Sikh religion &lsquo; while he is wearing a turban &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #84:1>
It should be noted that the exemption clearly only protects turbanned Sikhs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #85:1>
Anyone else riding a motorcycle without a helmet is guilty of an offence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #86:1>
( b ) The slaughter of animals and poultry
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #87:1>
The general law , as laid down in the Slaughterhouses Act 1974 , is that a standard practice must be followed when animals are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse or abattoir .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #88:1>
This practice involves &lsquo; stunning &rsquo; the animal so that it is insensible to pain , before actually killing it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #89:1>
Cattle , sheep and goats are included among the animals to which the rule applies and similar provisions are contained in the Slaughter of Poultry Act 1967 affecting turkeys , chickens and other domestic fowl .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #90:1>
The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that as little pain and suffering as possible is caused and anyone contravening the Acts is guilty of a criminal offence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #91:1>
However , both Acts contain an exemption for Muslims and Jews , to enable them to comply with their religious laws and traditions in this area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #92:1>
So far as Muslims are concerned , the normal method of slaughtering is known as dhabh and it involves cutting the throat of the animal or fowl while it is still conscious so as to allow the blood to start flowing out while it is still alive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #93:1>
It is true that some Muslim slaughterhouses have used the pre-stunning method in the UK on the basis of permission granted by the local imam , but they appear to be in the minority .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #94:1>
The meat produced by the religious method of slaughter is known as halal and strict Muslims will only eat meat prepared in this manner .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #95:1>
In order to comply with the law , dhabh must be performed both by a Muslim and for the food of Muslims .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #96:1>
In the case of Malins v Cole and Attard ( 1986 ) a Muslim slaughterman was convicted of an offence under the Slaughter of Poultry Act because the chicken he was caught selling in the Petticoat lane market area of London 's East End had not been slaughtered for the food of Muslims .
<ICE-GB:W2B-020 #97:1>
It had been bought by and slaughtered for a man wearing a crucifix ( who later turned out to be an RSPCA inspector ) without any check having been made by the slaughterman that it would in fact be used for the food of Muslims , as the statute requires .

<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #1:1>
AS WE HAVE ALREADY seen , rainforests are rich in animal species , and just about every group of animals has representatives in the forest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #2:1>
The only animals that are almost lacking are large mammals , though there are one or two .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #3:1>
Perhaps the largest of all is the okapi , a shy , elusive beast from west Africa .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #4:1>
There is also of course that best known of all animals , the gorilla .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #5:1>
There are two types of gorilla , so similar that it takes a specialist to tell them apart .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #6:1>
They are confined to the African rainforest and Ruanda has taken on their protection in a big way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #7:1>
Tours are run to enable visitors to watch gorillas in the wild , and they prove to be very popular .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #8:1>
The animals bring in a fair amount of foreign revenue and so they are carefully protected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #9:1>
John Burton of the Flora and Fauna Preservation Society was telling me some time ago how he came across small boys in that country selling the little wire toys that seem to be produced everywhere in Africa .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #10:1>
One of the versions was of a man riding a tricycle , designed so that the rotation of the wheels made the rider 's legs appear to be actually pedalling .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #11:1>
John persuaded the local children that the toy ought to be adapted so that instead of a human rider the toys featured a gorilla .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #12:1>
This was taken up with enthusiasm and now the children of the country are also aware that it is worth saving gorillas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #13:1>
The other large apes , the orang-utan of the Far East and the chimpanzee , are all forest species , and are all fairly large .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #14:1>
Chimps can grow as big as you or me , which is something that most people do not realise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #15:1>
Some of my favourite primates are gibbons , of which there are several species , again , like the orangs , from the Far East .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #16:1>
Every one of the primates mentioned so far is protected , yet chimps , orangs and gibbons are all still traded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #17:1>
If you know where to go you can find baby animals hidden away in animal dealers ' compounds and in the dingier realms of animal markets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #18:1>
I was offered two orangs in the Indonesian town of Pontianak and various species of gibbons in all sorts of places throughout Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #19:1>
THE MONKEYS
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #20:1>
Smaller primates are also to be found in rainforests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #21:1>
There is a whole range of monkey species in the jungles of the Celebes , Indonesia , south-east Asia generally and India , where a real delight is to watch a troop of langurs swing through the trees .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #22:1>
I cannot help feeling that rhesus monkeys are the thugs of the simian world , but I have a particular affection for langurs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #23:1>
Some of the monkeys of tropical Africa are delightful , and that continent has an extensive and varied monkey population , amongst them some of the most colourful of the world 's monkeys .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #24:1>
Most are fairly large , though there are smaller ones , like the little talapoin which are strange little bundles of green fur .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #25:1>
The forest monkeys of the Americas are varied and extraordinary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #26:1>
Some of them are fairly large and look like one imagines a monkey to look , but many species are very small , and in fact the tiniest monkey in the world , the pigmy marmoset , comes from this region .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #27:1>
You could sit one in a breakfast cup with no trouble and still leave room for the milk and sugar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #28:1>
An interesting fact about the New World monkeys is that some of them have prehensile tails .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #29:1>
It is a common misconception that this is true of monkeys generally but in reality the feature is only found in this region .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #30:1>
A spider monkey can hang by its tail from a branch with no trouble while it picks leaves or fruit to eat .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #31:1>
Some species look quite bizarre to the layperson and the red uakaris invariably invite comparison with bald old men since the whole head has no hair and the skin is bright red .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #32:1>
Sakis are odd<l->looking beasts as well , but I feel that some of the most beautiful of all primates are the smaller species from Central and South America .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #33:1>
Squirrel monkeys are exquisite little mites , though nowadays their numbers are declining fast as huge quantities have been exported for research .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #34:1>
Many of the tamarins and marmosets are singularly beautiful , and some of the most spectacular are the various golden lion tamarins , some of which are completely covered in a long , gold pelt .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #35:1>
They are very rare these days and confined to a small part of the forest where they are strictly protected but , like the apes mentioned earlier , these also are captured and find their way into trade , though nowadays only in very small numbers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #36:1>
Nonetheless , the populations are so small that it is questionable whether even this can be tolerated any longer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #37:1>
Emperor tamarins are about the same size as the other species , which is to say about the size of a good handful , and are clothed in black and reddish brown , and sport a long flowing moustache of white .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #38:1>
When the first skins were received by taxidermists in Germany many years ago , the animals had not been observed in the wild by the people who were mounting the skins , so , making a wild guess and hoping no doubt for a bit of royal patronage , the taxidermists waxed these facial hairs and curled them up on each side of the animal 's head in imitation of their beloved kaiser , thus earning the animal the name emperor tamarin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #39:1>
One of my favourites among the small South American monkeys is the silvery marmoset .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #40:1>
This has been so ever since I watched one at Jersey Zoo early one morning long before the visitors entered .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #41:1>
This little animal had recently been fed and , together with the fruit and everything else , the keeper had thrown a small handful of mealworms onto the floor of the outdoor enclosure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #42:1>
One of the marmosets was standing on its hind legs in the grass keeping careful watch to see where the next mealworm would make an appearance between the leaves of the grass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #43:1>
It leant forward , hands outstretched , waiting patiently , and on seeing a movement would suddenly pounce .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #44:1>
It was a funny and appealing cameo , and at that moment I fell in love with the animal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #45:1>
THE GIANT MONKEY ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #46:1>
One of the most intriguing stories about primates from South America is that of the giant monkey .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #47:1>
Some decades ago , I think in about 1925 , an expedition in what was then British Guiana came across a giant monkey of a hitherto unknown species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #48:1>
Someone in the party shot it and there remains a poor-quality photograph showing the hunter , and as far as I remember one or two other people as well , standing beside the corpse which had been propped up in a sitting position on a stool .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #49:1>
At a guess the monkey must have been something like 5ft ( 1.5m ) high standing on its hind legs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #50:1>
For some reason no part of the body was saved and the only evidence that the whole thing happened is this single photograph .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #51:1>
No other giant monkeys have been found since .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #52:1>
I would guess from the look of it that the animal was some species of spider monkey but I would love to know what it really was .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #53:1>
Monkeys are not the only mammals to inhabit rainforests , or even the only mammals to inhabit the canopies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #54:1>
There are plenty of squirrels as well , and in south-east Asia there is an animal that looks just like a squirrel though it is not related to them in any way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #55:1>
It is called the tupaia , or sometimes the tree shrew , and is a primate &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #56:1>
that is , it is a relation of monkeys , apes and humans .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #57:1>
LEMUR TO LORIS
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #58:1>
In a few parts of the world ( eg , Madagascar ) one can also come across those other delightful primates , the lemurs , which fill much the same ecological niche as the monkeys .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #59:1>
Many people do not realise that there are many species of lemur and without doubt the best known is the attractive ring-tailed lemur , which has now been made into a delightful soft toy whose sales result in a small royalty going towards the animal 's conservation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #60:1>
One can accept that monkeys occur in the treetops - after all we are brought up with the image of monkeys swinging through the branches - but it comes as something of a surprise to see some of the other denizens of the trees .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #61:1>
Of course in reality they are highly specialised forms that are perfectly adapted to life in the trees , but who would believe a tree kangaroo if someone came out with the idea halfway through a party ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #62:1>
There is one , though , in the forests of Papua New Guinea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #63:1>
And who could invent a sloth , a slow-motion animal that lives its life hanging upside-down beneath the branches of trees and which has to come down to the ground to defecate ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #64:1>
As though that is not crazy enough , everything else to do with the sloth is peculiar .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #65:1>
The hair grows the wrong way so that there is a parting along the centre of its chest and stomach .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #66:1>
Of course , when you think about it the reason is obvious - the rainwater runs off - but it still sounds odd .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #67:1>
The fur of a sloth is colonised by algae which give the animals a green tinge so that for all the world they look like the punks of the animal kingdom , and in this green fur live some small moths .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #68:1>
The moths spend their lives on the sloth until it climbs down to the ground to defecate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #69:1>
When that happens the female moths run like mad , jump off , lay their eggs in the pellets of dung , and leap back on before their host disappears once again into the treetops !
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #70:1>
The tamandua is another animal from the same region that I have an affection for .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #71:1>
It is a small ginger teddy bear with a long nose that feeds on ants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #72:1>
It has a prehensile tail and , if you happen to be climbing a tree and come into close contact with it , it will stand upright on its back legs , holding on tightly with the tail and , reaching out with two front legs , it will have a go at you if you get too close .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #73:1>
Tamanduas have jolly long claws and it is best not to tangle with one of them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #74:1>
None the less I feel they have a sort of cuddly appeal , though they are not as teddy like as some of the Old World rainforest mammals such as the agwantibo from west Africa or the bushbabies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #75:1>
Bushbabies have universal appeal with their short muzzles and huge eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #76:1>
The size of the eyes is to help them at night really , since they are nocturnal , rather than to make them look cuddly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #77:1>
The bushbabies ' place is taken in the Far East by the lorises , which are very like soft toys ( though their limbs are longer and slimmer than most ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #78:1>
Consequently they are captured and sold throughout the region as pets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #79:1>
However it needs a fair bit of experience to keep them properly and most of them die in captivity fairly soon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #80:1>
One of their requirements is a constant supply of live insects on which to feed , something that only the dedicated are willing to provide .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #81:1>
They look sad little things in the tiny wire cages in which they are sold , though perhaps their fate is no less awful than the lorises in India whose eyes are removed for use in some folk medicine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #82:1>
The dreadful thing is that the eyes are removed from the living , conscious animal which is afterwards returned to the tree on which it was found .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #83:1>
I was with some hunters one night , and asked them why they did it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #84:1>
The answer was that their religion forbade the taking of life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #85:1>
BIRD LIFE
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #86:1>
Perhaps it is the bird life of the rainforest that is the most spectacular and the most plentiful though much of it remains hidden from the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #87:1>
The appearance of birds in an area is seasonal , depending on the availability of food , so a tree coming into flower or the hint of ripening fruit will attract birds from miles around .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #88:1>
At ground level the most you can expect to see are the herons and their cousins , which haunt every patch of water they can find .
<ICE-GB:W2B-021 #89:1>
Sometimes one also comes across kingfishers , which can be tiny and brightly coloured or fairly large birds , larger than one expects a kingfisher has any right to be .

7 Use It or Lose It - The Importance of Exercise
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #2:1>
Our wards are seldom without an example of fracture of the upper part of the thigh bone ( Sir Astley Cooper , writing in 1822 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #3:1>
( Today patients with such fractures occupy 20 per cent of all orthopaedic beds in the United Kingdom ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #4:1>
In the &lsquo; good old days &rsquo; our great-great-grandmothers walked several miles to the village , struggled home with the shopping , carried in the wood and coal , and perhaps even heaved water up from the well in buckets - not to mention bearing lots of children , scrubbing clothes in the tub , kneading dough , tilling the fields , and standing for long hours in the scullery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #5:1>
All that heavy work may have broken great-great-grandmother 's health and sent her to an early grave , but if she had lived long enough she probably wouldn't have got osteoporosis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #6:1>
Tuberculosis possibly , pneumonia perhaps , but osteoporosis - no .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #7:1>
Aren't things different now !
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #8:1>
We are becoming a nation of sitters -
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #9:1>
we sit on the way to work , at work , coming home , at home .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #10:1>
We sit in the car instead of walking &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #11:1>
we use the lift instead of the stairs &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #12:1>
we spend the evenings sitting in front of the television .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #13:1>
We buy labour<l->saving devices to make sure we don't have to use physical energy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #14:1>
And look what happens to our bones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #15:1>
If It is probably no coincidence that the typical bent spine of osteoporosis has been given the name of &lsquo; dowager 's hump &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #16:1>
One dictionary defines dowager as &lsquo; a wealthy or dignified elderly woman ... a widow possessing property or a title obtained from her husband &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #17:1>
She was not a woman of the soil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #18:1>
No doubt the dowager of years gone by had a nanny to carry the children , did no housework , seldom lifted anything heavier than a bunch of flowers grown by the head gardener , ate a diet high in meat protein possibly washed down with red wine or port , protected her skin from the rays of the sun , travelled everywhere in her carriage , and survived well into old age .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #19:1>
By contrast , osteoporosis is fairly rare in developing countries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #20:1>
Not only do people of black races have denser , stronger bones than whites , but throughout most of the third world the women have many children , lift and carry heavy loads , walk long distances on foot , have few labour-saving devices , eat a diet low in protein , get plenty of sunshine on the skin , probably take little or no alcohol , and seldom live to be very old .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #21:1>
Their diet may be deficient in calcium , but their bodies will compensate by absorbing more and excreting less .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #22:1>
Not only do most women in Britain from the age of about 50 onwards take far too little calcium , they also tend to take far too little exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #23:1>
Bones , like muscles , get stronger when they are well used , and weaken when they are not used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #24:1>
An extreme example of unused bones occurs in astronauts who spend weeks weightless in space &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #25:1>
when they return to Earth their bones have become greatly weakened through lack of use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #26:1>
The same thing happens to those who are confined to wheelchairs , or who have to spend long periods in bed -
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #27:1>
they lose bone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #28:1>
In fact bone mass decreases whenever physical activity is reduced .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #29:1>
There is a three-way link between exercise , hormones and nutrition , which works like this :
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #30:1>
muscles are attached to bones , and during physical exercise the working muscles pull on the bones which then register the strain , stimulate the osteoblasts and reduce the activity of the osteoclasts in those bones that are exercised .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #31:1>
This extra activity by the bone-building osteoblasts causes higher levels of some hormones to be increased , which has the effect of increasing the amount of calcium that is absorbed from the diet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #32:1>
Exercise is also thought to increase the level of the hormone calcitonin in the blood , and calcitonin reduces bone resorption .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #33:1>
You can see now that exercise benefits your bones in two ways - by increasing the amount of new bone that is made , and by keeping more calcium within your body .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #34:1>
While the first effect of exercise is to reduce the amount of bone that is resorbed , continued exercise stimulates the formation of new bone , which is why it is much better to take small amounts of exercise regularly than to go in for rare short bursts of intense physical activity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #35:1>
The latter may reduce some bone resorption , but it is the regular exercise that will build new bone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #36:1>
Mechanical loading
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #37:1>
So from now on the new buzz words in your life must be &lsquo; mechanical loading &rsquo; , which means giving your bones and muscles plenty to do .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #38:1>
We have only as much bone as we need , and absolutely nothing can cause the skeleton to be heavier or stronger than the level required by the use you put it to .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #39:1>
No amount of calcium supplements will compensate for lack of mechanical loading of the skeleton .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #40:1>
There is a direct relationship between muscle size and bone size , and too little mechanical loading causes muscles to weaken , and then bones to do the same , and the rate of resorption increases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #41:1>
Both muscles and bones respond to being worked , and lack of adequate exercise is one of the most important factors in age-related bone loss .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #42:1>
Even elderly people could increase their muscle mass , thereby increasing their bone mass , or at least reducing the rate of loss &semi; and increased exercise leads to increased calcium absorption .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #43:1>
If you are at the time of life when your bone mass is declining , exercise can slow this process down which calcium on its own can't .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #44:1>
Exercise and calcium depend on each other -
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #45:1>
the exercise enables your body to make better use of the calcium you eat , but it will be more effective at building bone if you also take plenty of calcium ( at least 1000 mg a day ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #46:1>
Although young bone responds better to exercise than mature bone does , even older people 's bones benefit from regular exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #47:1>
And this , of course , is in addition to all the other benefits that it brings : better sleep , lower blood pressure , reduced stress , a good appetite , less constipation , better digestion ( so less need for those bone-eating antacids ) , more energy , and a general feeling of well<l>being at a time of life when things may not be looking so good .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #48:1>
About 50 per cent of elderly people who visit the doctor for a medical condition also have some degree of depression .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #49:1>
Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins ( antidepressant chemicals produced naturally by the body ) , and so helps lift depression .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #50:1>
It is also a much better way to keep your weight down than by cutting out dairy products .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #51:1>
Hip fractures often occur in people who take very little exercise , and are usually the result of a fall .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #52:1>
If you take exercise , your muscles become stronger , your reflexes quicker , and so you are less likely to fall , and of course if your bones are becoming stronger they will be less likely to break if you do fall .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #53:1>
What sort of exercise ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #54:1>
So what sort of exercise should you be taking ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #55:1>
As with calcium and vitamin supplements , some exercise is good , lots is not necessarily better , and too much can be harmful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #56:1>
Bearing in mind that bone will not form unless there is some physical activity to stimulate the bone-making process , it is obviously not enough to spend all day sitting in a comfortable armchair with a bottle of calcium tablets in one hand and a fitness manual in the other !
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #57:1>
Regrettably , the only way to take exercise is to get up and do it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #58:1>
Choose something that you can do regularly - every day if possible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #59:1>
A small amount daily is much better than lots at the weekend .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #60:1>
Remember that the first stage of exercise reduces the activity of the bone-resorbing osteoclasts , and it is not until you have been doing it for a while that the bone-making osteoblasts really have an extra effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #61:1>
Whatever you decide on , it must be convenient , acceptable and affordable , or you will not stick at it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #62:1>
If you are under about 35
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #63:1>
Make the most of these years to take plenty of regular vigorous exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #64:1>
Use stairs , not lifts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #65:1>
Go out on foot whenever possible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #66:1>
Jog and run ( provided you are under 35 ) , skip , play tennis , squash , badminton , volleyball , join an aerobics class , do vigorous dancing with jumping and twisting , or work on multigym equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #67:1>
Once you have vertebral fractures you will not be able to do these things ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #68:1>
so enjoy them now , and hopefully you will be postponing the day when you can't do them any longer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #69:1>
If you are between about 35 and the end of the menopause
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #70:1>
If you have no signs of vertebral fractures ( check with your doctor to be sure ) aim to do most of the things in the previous - under-35 - section , but perhaps not quite as vigorously .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #71:1>
Avoid jarring the spine , so jogging is not such a good idea now , as the pounding action may do more harm than good .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #72:1>
But in all other respects take as much exercise as possible , especially activity that involve &lsquo; mechanical loading &rsquo; on the bones and muscles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #73:1>
By all means swim and do yoga for general fitness and wellbeing , but as neither of these involves much mechanical loading , try to take other exercise too .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #74:1>
Obviously if you haven't taken much exercise recently , then start gently , and don't embark on a vigorous programme without a medical check-up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #75:1>
If it turns out you already have some osteoporotic fractures that you didn't know about , vigorous exercise could cause you to jar and fracture bones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #76:1>
Once you are declared fit , get started .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #77:1>
Avoid vigorous evening exercise if possible , as the increased adrenaline it produces may cause sleep problems , so try to take exercise in the morning or up to late afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #78:1>
Listen to your body , and when you are tired stop .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #79:1>
Don't exercise to the point of exhaustion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #80:1>
&lsquo; If If it isn't hurting it isn't doing any good &rsquo; is a harmful philosophy at any age , and especially after about 35 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #81:1>
If you have just started to get osteoporosis , or have been warned you might get it
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #82:1>
If you already have a vertebral fracture , or if you have had a Colles ' fracture of the wrist , ask your doctor if you have osteoporosis -
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #83:1>
after all no-one may have told you about it , and it 's important that you should know .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #84:1>
It 's your body , you have to live with it , and the more you know what state it 's in the more you can do something positive to look after it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #85:1>
Once you know you have osteoporosis that does not mean you now have to sit back and do nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #86:1>
Far from it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #87:1>
Particularly if it is still in the early stages , you should be working to strengthen whatever bone you have left . illustration
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #88:1>
So :
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #89:1>
&bullet; The ideal exercise , and one which almost anyone can do any time anywhere , is walking .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #90:1>
It is suitable for the busy , the unfit , and the lazy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #91:1>
You should walk whenever possible , at a brisk pace , not a leisurely stroll &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #92:1>
as a general rule it is better to walk a short distance fast than a long distance slowly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #93:1>
If you can average 7 miles ( 11 kilometres ) a week , including a 3 mile ( 4 1/2 kilometre ) walk once a week , you will increase the strength not only of your legs and back but possibly also of your arms , as walking may benefit even bones that are not directly involved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #94:1>
You should go at a somewhat faster than normal pace , with an even stride and swinging your arms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #95:1>
If you feel &lsquo; odd &rsquo; , compare yourself with those who brought jogging into fashion many years ago &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #96:1>
at the time they probably felt odd , but now no one looks at them twice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #97:1>
Soon the sight of older people striding briskly around swinging their arms will be an equally common sight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #98:1>
&bullet; Use stairs , not lifts or escalators .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #99:1>
At home , run up and down the stairs a few times every day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #100:1>
&bullet; Dance , either at home to your favourite music , or join a group or class .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #101:1>
&bullet; Join a keep-fit or aerobics class , but make sure the teacher knows you have osteoporosis and should not jolt or jar your bones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #102:1>
&bullet; Although yoga and swimming do not involve &lsquo; mechanical loading &rsquo; , they are both very good general exercise , build up muscles , and give a feeling of fitness and well-being .
<ICE-GB:W2B-022 #103:1>
But you will also need to do exercise that strengthens bones .

Epilepsy
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #2:1>
Definition and Causes
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #3:1>
The nervous system is made up of millions of tiny nerve cells , each of which has long arms or tendrils which allow it to communicate with the cells all around it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #4:1>
Electrical impulses travel from cell to cell , carrying messages which regulate all the body functions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #5:1>
The impulses that occur in the brain produce certain recognized patterns on an electroencephalogram ( EEG , or brain wave trace ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #6:1>
Their absence is one criterion that may be used by doctors to assess that a patient is dead .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #7:1>
Normally messages are carried correctly around the nervous system , enabling us to breathe , move , see , hear , digest and so on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #8:1>
But some people may have occasional discharges of abnormal electrical impulses in the brain , which send incorrect messages over a limited period of time -
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #9:1>
this is the condition of epilepsy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #10:1>
Sometimes epilepsy may develop as the result of a head injury , but it may also be caused by a number of other conditions including a congenital abnormality in the brain , infection ( such as meningitis ) , a brain tumour ( benign or malignant ) or addiction to alcohol or drugs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #11:1>
However , in the majority of cases there seems to be no obvious cause and the condition is said to be idiopathic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #12:1>
There are various types of epilepsy , each with different symptoms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #13:1>
Types of Epilepsy
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #14:1>
PETIT MAL
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #15:1>
This occurs mainly in children , being slightly more common in girls than in boys .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #16:1>
There is no convulsion but the patient 's consciousness becomes impaired for a matter of seconds during which she stares straight ahead and fails to respond to stimuli .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #17:1>
In many cases , this is accompanied by twitching of the eyelids and arms or by chewing and swallowing movements or fumbling with the fingers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #18:1>
Usually the patient stays upright and may even continue to walk or to ride a bicycle during the attack which comes on suddenly and disappears with equal suddenness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #19:1>
When the attack ends , some children are unaware that anything abnor<l>mal has happened and just continue to do whatever they were doing previously .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #20:1>
Petit mal rarely occurs before the age of four , with most cases starting between the ages of eight and twelve .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #21:1>
The vast majority of patients have stopped having attacks by the time they are seventeen , although in a very few the condition may continue into adult life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #22:1>
Some go on to develop grand mal epilepsy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #23:1>
The attacks may occur only occasionally or may be very frequent , with a patient having several hundred in a single day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #24:1>
In severe cases , the condition may seriously interfere with the child 's schooling and special arrangements may have to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #25:1>
Usually an individual attack lasts between two and forty-five seconds but , on rare occasions , a patient may go into &lsquo; petit mal status &rsquo; in which the attack is greatly prolonged .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #26:1>
GRAND MAL
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #27:1>
When epilepsy is mentioned , most people think automatically of grand mal convulsions , in which the patient falls to the floor and may thrash around .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #28:1>
Grand mal epilepsy is a surprisingly common condition , affecting between four and eight people in every thousand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #29:1>
And it is estimated that as many as three people in every hundred have had a fit at some time in their lives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #30:1>
However , because in many cases the condition is well controlled by medication and because sufferers don't necessarily like to talk about their illness , most people are not aware of the extent of epilepsy in the population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #31:1>
&lsquo; Idiopathic &rsquo; grand mal ( where there is no apparent cause ) usually starts in childhood , often between the ages of eight and twelve .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #32:1>
However , about 75 per cent of those affected will have stopped having attacks by the time they are twenty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #33:1>
Cases that start when the patient is over the age of twenty usually have an underlying cause .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #34:1>
The fits often occur early in the morning or even when the patient is still asleep .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #35:1>
Indeed , some people only ever have fits during the night .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #36:1>
As in the case of petit mal , attacks may occur rarely or frequently &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #37:1>
they may be brought on by late nights or the consumption of alcohol and may be more common in women around the time of menstruation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #38:1>
For several hours before a fit , a patient may feel irritable or depressed or , conversely , unusually elated .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #39:1>
The fit itself may begin with an aura in which the patient is aware of certain recognizable sensations , such as discomfort in the upper ab<l>domen , twitches , numbness or tingling , flashing lights in front of the eyes or a bad taste or smell .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #40:1>
The aura only lasts a few moments before the convulsion begins but may be long enough to enable the patient to get himself into a safe and comfortable position so that he will not hurt himself by falling to the floor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #41:1>
Whether or not the patient has an aura , the first major sign that the fit is beginning is a sudden loss of consciousness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #42:1>
All the muscles go into a violent spasm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #43:1>
This is known as the tonic phase .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #44:1>
The sudden contraction of the muscles of the chest forces air through the larynx ( voice box ) and may produce a characteris<l>tic cry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #45:1>
It is as he falls that the patient may bite his tongue , and blood and saliva may ooze from his mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #46:1>
His face becomes dusky , because the muscle spasm makes it impossible for him to breathe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #47:1>
After a few seconds , the spasm relaxes and is replaced by a series of violent jerking movements , which is known as the clonic phase .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #48:1>
It is at this point that the patient may froth at the mouth , as air enters the lungs in a series of gasps , through the accumulated saliva .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #49:1>
Some patients may wet themselves during this stage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #50:1>
After three or four minutes , the movements slow down and eventually stop .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #51:1>
The patient is now completely relaxed , breathing deeply but still unconscious .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #52:1>
After a few minutes he gradually regains consciousness but may remain confused and drowsy and may have a headache for several hours afterwards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #53:1>
Some patients go into an &lsquo; epileptic fugue &rsquo; √≠ , in which they wander off and do things of which they later have no recollection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #54:1>
Most patients sleep after an attack - for anything up to eighteen hours .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #55:1>
Individual patients and individual attacks vary , of course .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #56:1>
Sometimes a clonic phase may last for half an hour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #57:1>
Some children may find they are paralysed after an attack -
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #58:1>
this usually affects only one side of the body and lasts between twelve and twenty-four hours before disappearing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #59:1>
Some 5-8 per cent of patients suffer at one time or another from status epilep<l>ticus , a condition in which one fit is followed by others , without regaining consciousness in between .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #60:1>
This may be a life-threatening condition and needs urgent medical treatment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #61:1>
PSYCHOMOTOR SEIZURES
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #62:1>
This type of attack usually begins with a sudden alteration in mood and behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #63:1>
An aura is common , in which the patient may experience upper abdominal discomfort , nausea , giddiness , hallucinations of various types ( hearing , smelling , tasting or seeing things that aren't there ) or the &lsquo; d&eacute;j&agrave; vu &rsquo; phenomenon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #64:1>
The latter is something which many healthy people are aware of from time to time - the feeling that you have been in a particular place or situation before , but at the same time knowing that you haven't .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #65:1>
The patient may feel that the world around him has become unreal and he may be aware of a feeling of fear , although he is unable to say what it is that frightens him .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #66:1>
The symptoms may vary according to where in the brain the abnormal discharges start .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #67:1>
The patient usually becomes confused and may run round in circles , make chewing movements , smack or lick his lips and fiddle aimlessly with objects .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #68:1>
Sometimes the limbs go into spasm or the head and eyes are turned sharply to one side .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #69:1>
The patient may try to remove his clothes and , if restrained , may become violent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #70:1>
He may shuffle his feet , rub his hands or wet himself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #71:1>
The attack may end after a few minutes and be followed by confusion , or may progress into a grand mal convulsion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #72:1>
After the attack , the patient may be unable to remember anything about it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #73:1>
JACKSONIAN EPILEPSY
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #74:1>
A Jacksonian attack is one that begins locally and then may become generalized .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #75:1>
The first sign may be a change in the patient 's behaviour but usually the attack itself begins with twitching of one hand , one foot or one side of the face .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #76:1>
The movements are rhythmic and may occur in bursts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #77:1>
Gradually they spread to other muscles on the same side of the body .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #78:1>
They can stop at any point or they may progress to involve the whole body in a generalized fit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #79:1>
Two thirds of all patients who suffer from Jacksonian epilepsy have generalized fits at some time during their lives .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #80:1>
After the attack the muscles that were first involved may be weak or paralysed for several hours .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #81:1>
Some patients who suffer from Jacksonian epilepsy find that if they very firmly squeeze or press the muscles above those that are twitching , they can stop the attack from progressing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #82:1>
FEBRILE CONVULSIONS
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #83:1>
Some five children in every hundred will have a fit during infancy or early childhood as the result of a high fever .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #84:1>
A small proportion of these will turn out to be epileptic , the fever just precipitating the first attack , but in the majority of cases the fit is a result of the fever alone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #85:1>
A child who has had one febrile fit is at risk of having another whenever his temperature starts to rise rapidly but most children grow out of their susceptibility by the age of three .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #86:1>
Very rarely , a child may continue to have the occasional febrile fit until the age of seven or eight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #87:1>
The condition occurs more often in boys than in girls and the commonest cause is tonsillitis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #88:1>
Usually the fit , which takes the form of a generalized convulsion , is short , although two or three may follow each other in quick succession .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #89:1>
After the fit there is a short period in which the child cannot be roused .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #90:1>
Investigations
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #91:1>
If epilepsy is suspected , an EEG , or electroencephalogram , is usually necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #92:1>
A number of wires are taped to the patient 's head and these then record the brain 's activity on a machine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #93:1>
Only the activity closest to the surface is picked up so , if the abnormal focus from which the fits are starting is deep in the brain , the EEG may appear normal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #94:1>
The test is best done soon after a fit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #95:1>
Sometimes , when a generalized convulsion occurs in a previ<l>ously healthy person , meningitis may be suspected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #96:1>
In such a case , a lumbar puncture will be done to confirm or exclude this diagnosis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #97:1>
Under local anaesthetic , a small needle is inserted between two of the vertebrae in the lower part of the back and a small quantity of the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord ( the nervous tissue contained inside the backbone ) is drawn off .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #98:1>
If the patient is suffering from meningitis , the fluid may appear cloudy instead of clear and , when tested in the laboratory , will show evidence of infection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #99:1>
In older patients , when it seems possible that the fits may be due to a physical abnormality in the brain , such as a cyst , a tumour or a blockage of a blood vessel , there are a number of investigations that may be used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #100:1>
These include plain X-ray of the skull , brain scan and arteriography .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #101:1>
For the latter , a radio-opaque substance is injected into the bloodstream and allowed time to circulate &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #102:1>
then X-rays of the head are taken on which the blood vessels of the brain can be seen clearly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #103:1>
Orthodox Treatment
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #104:1>
PETIT MAL
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #105:1>
In most cases , the attacks will be partly or wholly controlled by sodium valproate or ethosuximide , although in some patients the latter may cause drowsiness , dizziness , sensitivity to light and digestive problems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #106:1>
An intravenous injection of diazepam may be needed to bring petit mal status to an end .
<ICE-GB:W2B-023 #107:1>
Medication has to be taken regularly until the patient has had four years without an attack or until he has reached his teens and a considerable amount of time has elapsed since the last attack .

7.2 Communicable diseases
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #2:1>
The distribution of a range of diseases , currently confined largely to the tropics and including malaria , trypanosomiasis , leishmaniasis , amoebiasis , filariasis , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , and various worm infestations , is correlated with temperature and could in theory be affected by climate change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #3:1>
There are also a number of other non-parasitic communicable diseases whose distribution is related to temperature , including yellow fever , dengue and other arbovirus diseases , plague , and dysentery and other diarrhoeal conditions . 8
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #4:1>
The patterns of development and multiplication of malaria parasites or viruses within their mosquito hosts are temperature-dependent . 9
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #5:1>
Extremes of the extrinsic incubation period ( incubation period in mosquitoes ) for yellow-fever virus , for example , are from three days to a few weeks , depending entirely on the mean ambient temperature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #6:1>
In Egypt , which lies partly on the edge of hot and temperate zones , water snails tend to loose their schistosome infections during Jan<l>uary , February , and March each year when the temperature is cooler .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #7:1>
If temperatures increase , Egyptian water snails may be able to spread schistosomiasis all the year round , increasing the already heavy par<l>asite burden of the Egyptian peasantry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #8:1>
Human activities have an important role in the transmission of many tropical diseases ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #9:1>
for instance , many of the breeding places for the major vectors of malaria in Africa are man-made , including pot<l->holes , irrigation channels , and so on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #10:1>
Human behaviour has the potential for reducing or increasing the impact of climate change on a number of communicable diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #11:1>
For instance , the increase in drought may result in people and animals gathering together for increasing periods of time at limited numbers of watering holes , thus encouraging the spread of disease .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #12:1>
Heavy rainfall may have variable effects over a short period .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #13:1>
Exces<l>sive rainfall may , of course , lead to flooding , with a loss of crops and an increase in breeding areas for insects that require water .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #14:1>
It can , on occasions , have the reverse effect by flushing out residual pools of insect vectors in river systems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #15:1>
The potential impact of climate change on communicable disease is not likely to be limited to the Third World .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #16:1>
Even in an affluent country such as Australia , mosquito-borne disease may pose consid<l>erable threats to health which will probably increase as a result of the greenhouse effect . 10
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #17:1>
The major mosquito-borne diseases in Australia are dengue fever , Australian encephalitis caused by the Murray Val<l>ley encephalitis virus , and epidemic polyarthritis caused by the Ross River virus .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #18:1>
In the past , malaria and filariasis have also been preva<l>lent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #19:1>
In tropical Australia , climate changes could increase the vulner<l>ability to a recurrence of malaria , as well as leading to an increase in the incidence of epidemic polyarthritis and an extension of the area of distribution of the Murray Valley encephalitis virus . .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #20:1>
In the case of dengue , the influence might be limited as the mosquito vector breeds in domestic containers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #21:1>
In the temperate part of Australia , there could be an increased incidence of epidemic polyarthritis and also a possi<l>ble increase in the number of outbreaks of Australian encephalitis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #22:1>
Australian encephalitis has an appreciable mortality rate , and may result in long-term effects ranging from minor personality and psy<l>chological disorders to severe paralysis and brain-damage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #23:1>
Using a range of climate scenarios for the USA , it has been found that tick-borne diseases - Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease - would spread northwards , although the distribution would also depend on the size of remaining forests and of the small mammal population .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #24:1>
Apart from occasional outbreaks of arbovirus encephali<l>tis , vector-control programmes and improved hygiene have virtually eradicated mosquito-borne diseases transmitted within the USA .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #25:1>
However , the potential exists for their reintroduction because of cut<l>backs on the use of pesticides , and the large numbers of recent immi<l>grants who could be sources of infection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #26:1>
Five of the numerous mosquito-borne diseases have been considered to be potential risks in the USA following climate change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #27:1>
Malaria , dengue fever , and the arbovirus-induced encephalitis were considered to be significant risks , and yellow fever and Rift Valley fever possible risks . 11
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #28:1>
It seems likely that climate change will result in increasing prob<l>lems with communicable diseases , although other factors such as human activity , patterns of rainfall , and insecticide use will clearly be important in determining their ultimate impact .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #29:1>
7.3 Ultraviolet radiation and the immune system
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #30:1>
Ultraviolet radiation is known to have effects on the immune system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #31:1>
For instance , coldsores not infrequently occur at the beginning of a summer holiday because of the immuno-suppressive effect of ultravi<l>olet radiation on skin resulting in activation of the herpes simplex virus .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #32:1>
It is possible that susceptibility to important skin infections such as leishmaniasis or leprosy might be increased by greater expo<l>sure to ultraviolet light because the expression of these diseases depends on the cell-mediated immune response . 12
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #33:1>
The immune response to transplantation is also affected , and in animals transplan<l>tation of tumours has been shown to be more likely to be successful following exposure to ultraviolet radiation . 13
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #34:1>
Patients who are immuno-suppressed for organ transplantation ( as well as other groups , such as those with genetic diseases which impair DNA repair ) are at an increased risk of the development of ultraviolet light<l->related skin cancer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #35:1>
Ultraviolet radiation induces the formation of suppressor T-cells which inhibit the normal anti-tumour response and permit the emergence and progression of tumours . 14
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #36:1>
Thus , the effects of ultraviolet radiation on the immune response of skin may play a role in the increased incidence of skin cancer expected follow<l>ing the depletion of stratospheric ozone , and increased ultraviolet exposure has the potential to interact synergistically with climate change in the case of some communicable diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #37:1>
7.4 Effects on food production
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #38:1>
The world 's food reserves are currently very sensitive to changes in the US grain harvest , which provides 90 per cent of the world 's sur<l>plus &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #39:1>
thus , any shortfall in the US harvest is likely to affect in the first instance those countries to whom grain is exported .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #40:1>
Rice is a staple food for 60 per cent of the world 's population and some countries where water management and irrigation are poorly developed , such as India and Burma , may be particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #41:1>
One hundred and fifty million children under 5 suffer from malnu<l>trition , and every year 14 million children die from largely pre<l>ventable causes of death .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #42:1>
Malnutrition is a contributory cause in approximately one-third of all child deaths . 15
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #43:1>
The proportion and absolute numbers of the world 's population living in countries with average food supplies of less than 2,200 calories per head per day declined between the 1960s and around 1980 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #44:1>
However , at that time one-third of the population in the developing world still lived in countries with daily food supplies of less than 2,200 calories .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #45:1>
A large proportion of the population in these countries is likely to be under<l>nourished . 16
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #46:1>
Between the years of 1950 and 1984 , the world grain<l->output increased 2.6-fold , but since then there has been little further increase .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #47:1>
Since 1984 there has been no world-wide increase in per<l->capita grain production because of continuing population growth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #48:1>
In Zambia , twice as many children died from malnutrition in 1984 as in 1980 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #49:1>
The infant-mortality rate in Brazil rose in 1983 and 1984 , particularly in the poorest regions , for the first time in decades .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #50:1>
This appeared to be a result of increasing poverty related to the heavy burden of international debt .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #51:1>
The initial impact of any further falls in per capita food production will in the first instance probably fall principally on children in the Third World .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #52:1>
Currently , the small average net gain of 15 million tons world<l>wide in grain harvests is well below the 28 million tons required merely to keep pace with the population growth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #53:1>
Growth in produc<l>tion of food around the world has been impaired by environmental degradation , scarcity of crop-land and irrigation water , and a dimin<l>ished response to the use of additional chemical fertilizers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #54:1>
Several pollutants , including ozone , sulphur dioxide , and nitrous oxide , may also have adverse effects on crop production . 17
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #55:1>
In addition to effects on crop production , atmospheric change could have an impact on animal diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #56:1>
For instance , a study in North America suggests that under some scenarios of climate change there could be a major exten<l>sion of the horn-fly season .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #57:1>
This already causes considerable losses in the beef - and dairy-cattle industries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #58:1>
Distribution of the insect carrier of anaplasmosis , a major infection of ruminants , could extend to northern US states with climate change . 18
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #59:1>
In addition , increased ultraviolet radiation could result in damage to the marine food-chain because of adverse effects on fish , shrimp and crab larvae , and the growing-season of invertebrate zooplankton populations , as well as on the nitrogen-fixation process in phytoplankton . 19
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #60:1>
7.5 Water supply
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #61:1>
Of the estimated 41,000 cubic kilometres of water which return each year from the land to the sea , around 9,000 cubic kilometres are read<l>ily available for human use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #62:1>
In theory , this is enough to sustain around 20 billion people , but in practice the local availability of water varies widely because population and water supply are unevenly distributed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #63:1>
Withdrawal rates differ widely from country to country ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #64:1>
for instance the average US resident consumes more than 70 times as much water per year as the average resident of Ghana . 20
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #65:1>
Nearly three-quarters of the water used is for agricultural purposes , and the area of irrigated land is increasing steadily each year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #66:1>
Decreases in summer rainfall together with increases in temperature predicted for central North American , southern European , and other sites is likely to have an adverse effect on agriculture , but in the long term could also affect the availability of water for human consumption .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #67:1>
Irrigation has increased the salinity levels in the return-water and soils of several river basins in the US , and reduc<l>tions in rainfall may further exacerbate this process . 21
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #68:1>
In the south<l->east and parts of the west of the USA , a large percentage of municipal water-supplies come from ground-water .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #69:1>
These regions tend to with<l>draw more ground-water than can be recharged and any increased drought caused by climate change could accelerate the mining of ground-water .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #70:1>
In countries with poorly developed water-supply systems , a reduction in water supply could contribute to the spread of diar<l>rhoeal and other diseases spread by the faecal-oral route .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #71:1>
The loss of vegetation and biomass consequent upon drought would lead to a reduction in fuel for cooking and heating water , thus further promot<l>ing the spread of disease .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #72:1>
Sea-level rise would lead to an increase in salinization of rivers , wetlands , and aquifers , causing harm to some aquatic plants and animals and posing a threat to the use of water by humans .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #73:1>
7.6 Sea-level rise
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #74:1>
Global warming could cause a sea-level rise of 0.5-2 metres by 2100 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #75:1>
Many coastal regions are already under threat for geological reasons or secondary to extraction of groundwater and other human activi<l>ties .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #76:1>
In the case of Bangkok , for instance , local subsidence has reached 13 cms per year because of excessive extraction of ground<l>water . 22
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #77:1>
The most serious implications are for those densely popula<l>ted parts of the world vulnerable to small rises in sea level , such as the Nile Delta in Egypt and the Ganges Delta in Bangladesh .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #78:1>
In the case of Egypt , around 16 per cent of the population live in a region compris<l>ing 0.4 per cent of the total area of the country , which would flood if the sea level rose by 50cms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #79:1>
In Bangladesh , floods caused the deaths of 300,000 people in the 1970s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #80:1>
Some of the most vulnerable coun<l>tries to sea-level rise include Bangladesh , Egypt , Pakistan , Indonesia , and Thailand , all of which have large , relatively poor , populations . 23
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #81:1>
Parts of Europe could also be vulnerable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #82:1>
In 1953 , floods killed over 1,000 people in the Netherlands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #83:1>
A 1-metre rise in sea level has been calculated to reduce the effectiveness of Dutch protective measures from an ability of being breached once every 10,000 years to once every 100 years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #84:1>
A 1-metre rise in sea level would wipe out much of England 's sandy beaches , salty marshes , and mud flats . 24
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #85:1>
7.7 Mental health
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #86:1>
It is likely that with climate change there will be an increasing num<l>ber of disasters related either to extreme events , such as storms in conjunction with sea-level rise , or to famine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #87:1>
There have been a num<l>ber of studies of the survivors of disasters which have suggested the potential in some cases for long-term effects on mental health . 25
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #88:1>
In 1972 , for instance , a dam collapsed in the USA leading to the deaths of 125 people and causing 4,000 to be homeless . 26
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #89:1>
Traumatic neurotic reactions were found in 80 per cent of the survivors , and there was persistent evidence of unresolved grief , survivor shame , and feelings of impotent rage and hopelessness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #90:1>
Disabling psychiatric symptoms included anxiety , depression , and changes in character and life-style .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #91:1>
Over 90 per cent of the children who were interviewed had develop<l>mental problems more than two years after the disaster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #92:1>
A study of individuals exposed to a cyclone in Darwin , Australia , showed that 41 per cent had psychological dysfunction at 10 weeks , but by four<l>teen months the level had returned to that of a controlled population . 27
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #93:1>
The psychological reactions to disaster may depend on the magnitude of destruction , the age of the population , and the degree of support that survivors receive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #94:1>
There is little doubt , how<l>ever , that the psychological sequelae of disaster may result in a con<l>siderable increase in contact with the medical system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #95:1>
For instance , following a flood in Bristol , UK , in 1968 , in which 3,000 homes were inundated and one person died , there was an increase of 53 per cent in visits to doctors for the year following . 28
<ICE-GB:W2B-024 #96:1>
A similar observation was made following the effects of a flood in Brisbane , Australia , in 1974 . 29

SEVEN
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #2:1>
All at Sea
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #3:1>
The oceans are the key to understanding changes in global climate -
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #4:1>
but , to mix the metaphor , they are also the joker in the pack .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #5:1>
Most of our planet is covered by water , and interactions between the oceans and the atmosphere establish the balance of natural greenhouse gases that has maintained temperatures on Earth comfortably above those of the airless Moon , but comfortably below those of hothouse Venus .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #6:1>
The seas also smooth out the distribution of heat across the planet , transporting warmth from the tropics , where solar heating is strongest , to higher latitudes , where the direct heat of the Sun is weaker .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #7:1>
Unfortunately , we do not understand the workings of the oceans , and of the air/sea interface , well enough to predict exactly how these patterns will change as the world warms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #8:1>
But there is a disturbing possibility that any changes that do occur will be sudden , a switch in the mode of oceanic circulation from one pattern to another , rather than gradual .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #9:1>
Today , the atmosphere and the oceans each carry about the same amount of heat from the equator to the poles , but they do it in different ways .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #10:1>
In the atmosphere , from the equator out to about 30&degree; latitude latitude in each hemisphere , the dominant feature is simple convection , with hot air rising near the equator , cooling and moving outward high in the troposphere , and sinking down to the surface again to become a cool wind blowing into the equator from higher latitudes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #11:1>
This circulation pattern produces the reliable trade winds that were of such prime importance to shipping in the days of sail .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #12:1>
Further away from the equator , heat is redistributed in a more messy fashion by the weather systems - the highs and lows - which are familiar to anyone who lives in temperate latitudes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #13:1>
The weather systems are actually eddies , like the swirling patterns formed in flowing water when it moves past an obstruction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #14:1>
At these latitudes , sometimes the wind blows one way , at other times it blows from a different direction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #15:1>
But by and large the effect is the same -
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #16:1>
air blowing towards the poles is warm , while air blowing from the polar regions is cold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #17:1>
The way oceans transport heat from the equator to the poles is different for two reasons .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #18:1>
First , the oceans are heated from the top , while the atmosphere is heated from the bottom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #19:1>
Warm ocean water heated by the Sun cannot rise because it is already at the top of the ocean .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #20:1>
So although there is convection in the oceans , it is , in a sense , upside down convection compared with what we are used to in the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #21:1>
Atmospheric convection is driven by hot air rising at the equator &semi; but oceanic convection is driven by cold water sinking at high latitudes . .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #22:1>
Just as the warm air ris<l>ing up pushes other air out of the way and sets the atmospheric convection circulating , so the sinking cold water at high latitudes pushes other water out of the way , eventually ensuring that water rises to the surface in the tropics and is warmed by the Sun as it begins to move out towards the poles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #23:1>
But even then the ocean currents cannot flow as freely as the winds blow , and the second difference between oceanic and atmospheric currents comes into play .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #24:1>
There are huge land masses which divide the oceans of the world into two main basins in the northern hemisphere ( the Atlantic/Arctic and the Pacific ) and three in the south ( Atlantic , Indian and Pacific ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #25:1>
Although the southern ocean basins do join at high latitudes to form the Southern Ocean , surrounding Antarctica , the way most of the waters of the world are confined by continental masses forces the currents to flow around the basins in roughly circular patterns , called gyres ( Figure 7.1 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #26:1>
The path followed by such an oceanic current depends partly on the difference in temperature between the equator and the poles , partly on the effect of the Earth 's rotation , and partly on the shape of the ocean basin itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #27:1>
The Earth 's rotation ( from west to east ) spreads out currents flowing along the eastern side of a basin , but piles up the currents into strong , relatively narrow streams in the western sides of the ocean basins -
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #28:1>
the western land mass is always moving towards the water , while the eastern continents are moving away from it ( which is why sea level at the Pacific end of the Panama Canal is lower than sea level at the Caribbean end ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #29:1>
The Gulf Stream which runs northward up the western side of the North Atlantic is the archetypal example of all these processes at work .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #30:1>
It carries thirty million cubic metres of water every second through the Florida Straits , and that water is 8&degree;C warmer than the water that returns south as the gyre completes its circuit of the basin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #31:1>
The rate at which heat is being transported northward is more than a million billion watts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #32:1>
The Atlantic is , in fact , the only basin which provides heat for the Arctic Ocean in this way &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #33:1>
the northern Pacific is almost completely blocked off at the Bering Strait , where the Soviet Union and the United States very nearly have a land frontier ( the strait was , indeed , dry land during the recent series of ice ages , when sea level was lower ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #34:1>
So in the Pacific Ocean , equatorial heat cannot reach up to the highest northern latitudes , and most of the warmth flows southward , linking up with the warm southward flow from the Indian Ocean ( which is completely blocked to the north ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #35:1>
Then it splits into two parts : a current that flows into the Southern Ocean and eventually transports heat to high southern latitudes , and a current which flows around southern Africa and into the Atlantic , where it moves northward and eventually helps to make the warm currents flowing poleward in the North Atlantic stronger .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #36:1>
In the south , meantime , the main current in the Southern Ocean flows in an almost circular path around Antarctica , as the Circumpolar Current .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #37:1>
Although this provides a barrier to the direct flow of warm water southward , heat is carried across the Circumpolar Current in the form of eddies , rather like the swirling low pressure systems that transport atmospheric warmth northward at the latitudes of the United States and Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #38:1>
About 300,000 billion watts of heat is transported in this way - significantly less than the equivalent northward flow , because of the way the shape of the ocean basins forces the currents to flow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #39:1>
Over the long span of geological time , the geographical patterns of the land masses have changed as continents have drifted about the globe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #40:1>
This has altered the circulation patterns of the oceans , and has caused dramatic changes in climate -
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #41:1>
we live in an epoch when there is ice at both poles , but when the dinosaurs dominated the Earth there may only have been ice on high mountains .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #42:1>
Then ocean currents carrying warm water could reach both polar regions largely unobstructed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #43:1>
Clearly , the pattern of ocean currents today fits in with the geographical pattern of the continents today .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #44:1>
But is it the only pattern of ocean currents that fits the present day geography of the globe ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #45:1>
One person who thinks it is not , and who suspects we may be in for a &lsquo; flip &rsquo; of the current system ( and therefore the climate ) into a new pattern is Wallace Broecker .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #46:1>
It is , he says , just a hunch &semi; but as we have seen , Broecker 's hunches have an uncanny knack of coming true .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #47:1>
Unpleasant surprises ahead ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #48:1>
The climate of our planet is determined by a combination of factors , known as boundary conditions : the geography of the globe , which determines ocean circulation patterns &semi; the amount of heat reaching the Earth from the Sun &semi; the amount of carbon dioxide in the air &semi; and so on .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #49:1>
When one of the boundary conditions changes slowly but steadily , you might expect climate to change in the same way with the Earth , for example , steadily getting warmer if the output of heat from the Sun steadily increases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #50:1>
But two researchers based in Texas , Thomas Crowley and Gerald North , recently showed that this is far from always being the case .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #51:1>
Sometimes slowly changing boundary conditions produce a sudden jump in climate from one state to another , a discontinuous change as a result of a &lsquo; last straw &rsquo; effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #52:1>
And when that happens , it doesn't necessarily follow that slowly restoring the boundary conditions to their previous values will cause the climate to flip back into the state it used to be in .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #53:1>
The Texas researchers carried out their study ( not the only one of its kind , but particularly relevant to the present story ) to show how sudden changes in climate millions of years ago might have contributed to ecological disasters when many species of plants and animals disappeared from the face of the Earth in a short period of time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #54:1>
Fossil evidence points to five such &lsquo; major extinctions &rsquo; during the past six hundred million years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #55:1>
But their work may also be relevant to the world of the twenty-first century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #56:1>
The jumps happen because the climatic systems of the Earth may be able to exist in two ( or more ) stable states for a single set of boundary conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #57:1>
To keep things simple , imagine that everything else stays the same , but the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere slowly increases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #58:1>
There is a particular range of values for the greenhouse effect where the Earth can exist quite happily either with or without an icecap over the Arctic Ocean .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #59:1>
If the ice is present , then it reflects away enough incoming solar energy to keep the pole cool in spite of the greenhouse effect , and thereby to maintain itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #60:1>
If the ice is not there then the polar sea is warmer , because it absorbs more solar energy than the shiny ice does , and the ice cannot form .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #61:1>
If the world starts in this range of possible states , with an icecap , and the greenhouse effect steadily increases as carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere , there will come a time when the warming effect is so strong that the ice begins to melt back rapidly , as its cooling influence is overwhelmed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #62:1>
As it does so , more dark water is exposed , the polar sea warms once more , and in a very short time the positive feedback removes all the ice .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #63:1>
The whole northern hemisphere will be warmer as a result , by several degrees Celsius , even though the greenhouse effect has only increased by a tiny amount .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #64:1>
But now , if by magic the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is steadily reduced once more , the ice will not come back immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #65:1>
Instead , the world must cool to a point where ice begins to grow near the pole in spite of the dark ocean 's ability to absorb heat .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #66:1>
Then the ice reflects away solar heat , the polar region cools still more , and the icecap soon re-forms -
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #67:1>
but none of this happens until the carbon dioxide concentration has fallen far below the critical value at which the icecap disappeared when the concentration was increasing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #68:1>
When the two Texas researchers put some numbers into their model calculations of this kind of process , they found that at the critical point the flip can occur for a temperature change equivalent to a variation of just 0.0002 per cent in the Sun 's output .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #69:1>
This is less than one ten-thousandth of the size of the effect associated with changes in the Earth 's orbit , the Milankovitch cycles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #70:1>
It is so small that it suggests that human contributions to the greenhouse effect could well have a dramatic influence on climate in the near future , when some critical threshold is reached and passed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #71:1>
Unfortunate<l>ly , because the real world is more complicated than the computer models , the models cannot , as yet , tell us exactly when such a threshold will be reached , or which part of the climate system is likely to flip first .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #72:1>
Melting the north polar icecap may not be on the agenda for another fifty years or so , as we shall see in Chapter Nine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-025 #73:1>
But ocean circulation patterns may respond to the steadily growing greenhouse effect even before then , if Broecker 's instinct is correct .

Climates of the World
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #2:1>
The countries around the world do not fit into neat and precise categories of climate and weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #3:1>
Nations , especially those as vast as the Soviet Union and the United States , may sprawl over several different climatic zones making life for one inhabitant very different from that of a fellow countryman living thousands of miles away .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #4:1>
You only have to look at the contrast between life in California and life in New York to see this .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #5:1>
However , it is useful and valid to split regions of the world up and describe them according to the types of weather they experience and thus arrive at a number of describable weather patterns , or climates .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #6:1>
I will begin with a look at the weather of our own country , which is part of a temperate climate , before moving on to the different and very varied climates of the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #7:1>
Temperate British Isles
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #8:1>
It is a national pastime for many of us to talk about , and largely moan about , our weather &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #9:1>
the weather is often the initial topic in any conversation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #10:1>
There is a reason for this , in that our weather is changeable , influenced largely by the unsettling effect of low-pressure zones moving in with the prevailing westerly and south-westerly winds from the Atlantic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #11:1>
However , there are many reasons why instead of complaining about the weather - or blaming it on the forecaster ! - we should be thankful for the climate that prevails on our shores .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #12:1>
Ours is part of a temperate climate , which is characterized by rainfall all year round , and a relatively small fluctuation in temperatures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #13:1>
The British Isles are in a maritime temperate zone ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #14:1>
that is to say our weather is greatly influenced by the seas around us , which keep summer temperatures relatively cool but at the same time prevent very cold weather in winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #15:1>
This is because , unlike the land , the sea takes a comparatively long time to heat up and cool down .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #16:1>
So after a summer of warm weather the seas around the British Isles retain warmth throughout much of the winter which helps to temper the impact of cold winds and cold air masses approaching us .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #17:1>
On the other hand , when spring and early summer arrive the sea has cooled down and thus can be quite cold in May and June even though the weather may be warm and sunny - and any breezes coming off the sea will have a correspondingly cooling effect on the temperatures we feel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #18:1>
This is particularly true on the east coast of Great Britain with the waters of the cool , shallow North Sea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #19:1>
On a warm summer 's day the air over the land is warmed , causing it to rise .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #20:1>
To replace it the colder air over the sea moves in - the start of a sea breeze - which has the effect of reducing the temperature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #21:1>
However , this sea breeze is unlikely to extend right inland , so areas well away from the coast will be noticeably warmer than those on the coast .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #22:1>
Another , unseen , factor on our temperatures , especially in winter , is the Gulf Stream ( or North Atlantic Drift ) which brings warm waters across the ocean .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #23:1>
These waters bathe our west coasts , keeping temperatures higher and reducing the chances of frost in winter for these coastal areas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #24:1>
It is significant that some of our coldest waters during winter are off the coast of Norfolk , which does not benefit from the effects of the Gulf Stream .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #25:1>
Some of the warmest waters are off the coast of Cornwall where the sea might be a respectable 10&degree;C ( 50&degree;F
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #26:1>
All in all the seas around us , as well as being a useful protection against would-be invaders , are a good natural defence against extremes of very cold weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #27:1>
Despite this , and even in a small country like the British Isles , there can still be quite large variations in climate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #28:1>
For example , on average Cambridge has something like a dozen days a year when the temperature will reach 25&degree;C ( 77&degree;F
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #29:1>
Another vital factor affecting our climate is the wind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #30:1>
Most people know that our prevailing wind is a south-westerly wind , which means simply that looking at records over a long period the wind from the south-west will be the most common .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #31:1>
Quite why this is so is part of a complex global system of weather patterns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #32:1>
Part of the reason has to do with two relatively permanent weather features :
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #33:1>
one is a high-pressure area around the Azores &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #34:1>
the other is the presence of low-pressure areas in the Atlantic to the north .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #35:1>
As one would expect , air starts to travel from high to low pressure and so it is with winds from the Azores which travel to the low-pressure areas to the north-west of the British Isles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #36:1>
But because the Earth is spinning , the winds do not travel in a straight line but are &lsquo; bent &rsquo; in our direction by the Coriolis spin , or effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #37:1>
This gives us winds from the south-west and west .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #38:1>
The weather associated with these winds is generally warm and moist , giving drizzle and low cloud , but as we shall see shortly wind direction alone is not a perfect indicator of the type of weather we experience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #39:1>
A wind from the due north , from the Arctic , is not very common but as one would expect it can bring very cold weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #40:1>
As this extremely cold air is heated by the relatively warm sea to the north of the British Isles , low-pressure areas can form .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #41:1>
These are called polar lows .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #42:1>
They can be about the same size as an average county and can bring severe snow storms in winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #43:1>
More common are north-westerlies which often bring showery weather &semi; the frequency and intensity of the showers depending on whether it is summer or winter , day or night .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #44:1>
Winds from the south are not a common feature of British weather , but when they do arrive they can herald very fine , warm weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #45:1>
They may originate over North Africa and pass over France , so they remain fairly dry and are unlikely to bring much rain on their own .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #46:1>
However , many people have heard of the definition of an Englishman 's summer as &lsquo; three fine days and a thunderstorm &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #47:1>
The truth behind this saying can be seen when a southerly wind bringing warm , dry weather to this country is met by a moist wind from the south-west .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #48:1>
The mixture of warm air and moisture creates thunderstorms at altitude - maybe 3,000 metres ( 10,000 feet ) - bringing thunder and sheet lightning and heavy downpours from France , often at night .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #49:1>
Easterly winds can bring very cold spells of weather ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #50:1>
in fact it is winds from the east that produce our coldest weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #51:1>
The reason for this is that the easterly wind comes from the direction of the Soviet Union , a huge land mass which cools down in winter - it lacks the tempering influence of the sea - to extremely low temperatures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #52:1>
Easterly winds bring us this extreme cold and , unlike a northerly wind , the easterly wind only has a short distance to travel over the warming sea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #53:1>
It was easterly winds which brought the severe cold of the winters of 1947 and 1962/3 - two of the coldest winters this century in the British Isles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #54:1>
Although the easterly wind is a dry wind , having blown mostly over land , it can pick up a little moisture over the North Sea and bring bands of low cloud over the east coast .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #55:1>
In summer , the intense heating in the interior of Europe produces hot , thermal currents so beloved of glider pilots .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #56:1>
This may be responsible for the fact that around twenty years ago many of the top gliders were Czechs or Poles , who lived in the path of these dry and warm easterly currents .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #57:1>
As I mentioned earlier , wind directions are a good indication of the type of weather that may be approaching , but they do not tell the whole story .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #58:1>
If we consider that wind is moving air , then that air must have originated somewhere .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #59:1>
A band of air which has an identifiable uniformity of temperature and humidity is what is known as an air mass and , while these often conform to the north , south , east and west wind patterns outlined above , complications can occur when the air masses become mixed up , or approach from an unexpected direction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #60:1>
The most common air mass affecting the British Isles is the polar maritime which originates in the Arctic and reaches us after sweeping across the North Atlantic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #61:1>
The sea has the effect of warming it from below , producing clouds and showers in the unstable mass of air .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #62:1>
In winter , this air mass will bring the worst weather to the north and west of the country , because as the air reaches inland there is insufficient warmth in the wintry sun to warm the ground below and continue the formation of showers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #63:1>
However , in summer this air mass can produce showers all over the country as the sun-lit ground heats up the air , causing it to rise and form showers over many areas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #64:1>
A variation on this air mass , a returning polar maritime , also originates in the Arctic , but sweeps out wide into the Atlantic before making a homeward journey towards the pole .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #65:1>
The difference here is that after initial warming in the middle of the Atlantic , the unstable elements are cooled in their lowest layers as the air mass begins to track northwards again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #66:1>
So , when it reaches the British Isles it tends to produce dull , overcast weather often with drizzle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #67:1>
However , enough instability survives in its upper reaches to be able to produce showers and even thunderstorms .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #68:1>
These two air masses , together with the tropical maritime , are the bands of air which most affect our weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #69:1>
The tropical maritime comes from the Azores and further west in the Gulf of Mexico , so it is a warm , humid air mass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #70:1>
This mass keeps temperatures high in winter , often with damp , wet and overcast conditions with no chance of frost .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #71:1>
In summer , the coastal regions of the West Country may still be hit by moist , damp weather especially on high ground .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #72:1>
The weather brought by a tropical maritime air mass will be mild and humid rather than hot , except for parts of the east or south-east of the country .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #73:1>
Generally speaking , areas which are to the east and in the lee of high ground experience the best weather when such an air mass prevails .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #74:1>
A good example is east Devon which lies in the lee of Dartmoor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #75:1>
Tropical maritime weather is often &lsquo; muggy &rsquo; and oppressive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #76:1>
It produces fog on coasts and hills and , while it wards off low temperatures , it does not always feel pleasant .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #77:1>
Less common is the Arctic air mass , blowing directly from the pole and which , as mentioned above in the context of northerly winds , can produce heavy snow showers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #78:1>
It was an Arctic air mass which produced a severe spell of snow during late March and early April 1975 -
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #79:1>
the snow was dry and powdery , indicating it came from a very cold air mass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #80:1>
The air mass bringing the coldest temperatures is the polar continental mass which comes in from the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #81:1>
Fortunately , it is not that common .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #82:1>
The polar continental is usually a dry air mass , having little distance to travel over the sea .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #83:1>
On occasions it can cross over the North Sea from Scandinavia , which gives it a chance to pick up moisture that falls as snow on the east coast in winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #84:1>
Last and least common over the British Isles is the tropical continental air from the south , originating from North Africa .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #85:1>
This brings warm , dry weather .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #86:1>
Sometimes it carries red Saharan dust which falls with rain , leaving a reddish film over buildings and parked vehicles in southern England .
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #87:1>
( Before leaving air masses let me mention that you can read about what happens when different ones meet out in the Atlantic on page 118 -
<ICE-GB:W2B-026 #88:1>
the result can be low-pressure zones tracking towards the British Isles . )

WORKING WITH THE LAND
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #3:1>
ORGANIC FARMING IN PRACTICE
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #4:1>
The key to organic farming lies in achieving a balance between crops and livestock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #5:1>
This may come as a surprise to those who associate organic food with vegetarianism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #6:1>
It may also be something of a disappointment to animal rights activists who object to the exploitation of farm animals and mistakenly see organic farming as an alternative .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #7:1>
In certain parts of the country , notably the hills of Wales or the Scottish lowlands , some organic farmers keep only animals , whereas in the drier eastern half of the country one or two farmers are trying to develop so-called &lsquo; stockless systems &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #8:1>
However , the real potential for organic expansion is with a return to patterns of agriculture associated with mixed farming , i.e. both crops and livestock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #9:1>
Successive generations have reinforced and refined the art and craft of farming .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #10:1>
But in the last forty years , agriculture has lost touch with its roots .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #11:1>
The immense power of chemicals has seduced us into believing that we can lord it over nature .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #12:1>
Fundamental rules , such as not growing crops year after year on the same soil , are abandoned now that diseases and weeds can be blitzed with pesticides .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #13:1>
A daily diet of &lsquo; in-feed &rsquo; medication allows animals to be crammed together in sheds under conditions that invite diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #14:1>
Animal manure , once appreciated as a valuable fertilizer , is now considered only as a waste product .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #15:1>
Instead of fertilizing the land , it is a pollutant to be disposed of - all too frequently into rivers , with disastrous consequences .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #16:1>
The accumulated wisdom of countless farmers the world over has been jettisoned almost overnight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #17:1>
Organic farming takes its cue from traditional agriculture .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #18:1>
It makes use of the best ideas from the past and grafts onto them a scientific approach coupled with modern techniques that were unheard of in our grandfathers ' day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #19:1>
Organic farmers are aware that - like their conventional counterparts - they have to feed their crops as well as control weeds , pests and diseases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #20:1>
What is different is that organic farmers choose to do all this in ways that are in sympathy with , not hostile to , the environment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #21:1>
Another difference is that of &lsquo; sustainability &rsquo; , i.e. the ability of the land to produce food indefinitely .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #22:1>
Modern farming methods exploit natural resources , particularly energy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #23:1>
Up to a tonne of oil may be needed to produce a tonne of nitrogen fertilizer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #24:1>
Overall , most conventional farming systems consume far more in the way of fossil fuel energy than they produce as energy contained in the crop .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #25:1>
You could say that we are all eating oil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #26:1>
The fact that this squandering of a scarce resource is justified by present-day economics is yet another sign of our cavalier attitude towards future generations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #27:1>
Sixty years from now , our grandchildren will curse us when dwindling supplies make oil more expensive than gold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #28:1>
Organic farming , on the other hand , uses on average up to 60 per cent less energy from fossil fuels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #29:1>
But it is not only energy that is wasted by chemical farming methods .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #30:1>
Soil , the farmer 's most precious resource of all , is disappearing at a steadily accelerating rate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #31:1>
Deprived of the organic matter that binds particles together , crushed by heavy machinery and exposed to the elements in vast open fields , Britain 's soils are washing and blowing away .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #32:1>
It is estimated that up to 44 per cent of the arable soils in England and Wales are currently at risk .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #33:1>
Losses of topsoil from individual fields amounting to more than 100 tonnes per hectare are no longer uncommon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #34:1>
Steadily worsening crop yields from degraded soil may be masked in the short term by even higher applications of fertilizer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #35:1>
But even this has its problems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #36:1>
Potassium and phosphorus ( in the form of phosphate ) , both major plant nutrients , come from mined deposits &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #37:1>
evidence suggests that these reserves may last only a hundred years or so at most .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #38:1>
As for nitrogen , the disastrous effects of increasing the use of this nutrient are starting to show up in our contaminated water supplies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #39:1>
Farmers should be putting on less nitrogen , not more .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #40:1>
As more farmers change over to organic techniques , the landscape will change too .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #41:1>
More land will be under grass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #42:1>
Livestock will return to graze in the fields .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #43:1>
Hedges will be needed to keep in stock and trees planted for them to shelter under .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #44:1>
Hedgerows will be cut less often with flail trimmers , because organic farmers realize their value as refuges and food sources for birds and other wildlife which in turn act as unpaid pest controllers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #45:1>
There will be a reduction in crop spraying , less risk of pollution from farm slurry , and fewer noxious smells from intensive livestock units .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #46:1>
These are just a few of the immediate , visible benefits that will come about as chemical farming methods are gradually abandoned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #47:1>
A TYPICAL ORGANIC FARM
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #48:1>
What is an organic farm ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #49:1>
How does it work ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #50:1>
Without chemicals how can crops grow and pests be kept in check ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #51:1>
There is no such thing as a &lsquo; typical &rsquo; organic farm , because each one varies according to the crops grown and animals kept &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #52:1>
and they are influenced by the type of soil , the amount of rainfall and geography .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #53:1>
However , there are several obvious features that they share in common .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #54:1>
Most have one or more livestock enterprises - a dairy herd , a flock of sheep , perhaps some free<l->range pigs and hens or , instead , a herd of beef cattle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #55:1>
Between half and three-quarters of the farm is likely to be grassland .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #56:1>
Some fields remain in grass permanently ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #57:1>
others stay in grass for only a few years at a time before being ploughed up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #58:1>
Most of the rest of the farm is used for growing crops such as cereals and vegetables for sale , or root and fodder crops for feeding livestock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #59:1>
The farm might have a few acres cultivated as a specialist market garden or orchard , but other areas are left uncultivated as a habitat for wildlife .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #60:1>
This system has many advantages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #61:1>
It uses resources efficiently because by-products from both crops and livestock are recycled .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #62:1>
On conventional farms , for instance , straw left over after grain has been harvested has no use , so it is burned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #63:1>
On organic farms , straw is used in a variety of ways :
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #64:1>
it can be fed to animals or used as bedding &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #65:1>
it can also be used for roofing -
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #66:1>
thatchers claim that straw from organic farms is easier to work and lasts twice as long as the same stuff grown conventionally .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #67:1>
Finally , when straw is combined with manure and composted , it can be spread onto the land to return fertility to the farm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #68:1>
Any suitable vegetable waste is fed to livestock or recycled through the compost heap .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #69:1>
Nothing is burned , wasted or thrown away .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #70:1>
All nutrients on the farm are recycled through farmyard manure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #71:1>
This is produced by livestock that are kept in covered yards over winter , and consists of a mixture of animal dung and urine plus a bedding material , usually straw .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #72:1>
The use of large quantities of straw not only makes life more comfortable for the animals , but also cuts down the smell .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #73:1>
Each day , fresh straw is strewn on top of the ever-thickening pile which , by the end of winter , can be several feet deep .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #74:1>
In the spring , once the animals have been turned out into the fields , the manure is shovelled from the yards and composted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #75:1>
After the hay or silage has been made it is usually spread back onto the grassland , though farmers may use some of it direct on the crops if they are growing vegetables .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #76:1>
FERTILITY WITHOUT FERTILIZERS
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #77:1>
In general an organic field spends two to four years as grass being grazed by livestock .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #78:1>
It is then ploughed up and crops are grown for two or three years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #79:1>
After that , the land is returned to grass and the cycle repeats itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #80:1>
Clover is the key to the success of this system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #81:1>
All plants require nitrogen for growth , and plants growing organically are no exception .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #82:1>
The difference is that conventional farmers look to artificial fertilizers to provide the nitrogen needs of their crops , while organic farmers turn to clover .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #83:1>
A typical temporary field , or &lsquo; ley &rsquo; of grass will contain a mixture of grasses , clovers and herbs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #84:1>
Clover , along with other species of legumes , is special in that it &lsquo; fixes &rsquo; nitrogen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #85:1>
The plant rootlets secrete nutrients which nourish specialist bacteria that live in the nodules attached to the roots .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #86:1>
In return , these bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen , absorbed through soil pores , into nitrate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #87:1>
The plant uses this nitrate to grow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #88:1>
In other words , the farmer has a source of &lsquo; free &rsquo; nitrogen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #89:1>
Paradoxically , if nitrogen fertilizer is used on clover or other legumes , the bacteria stop working .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #90:1>
Every time clover is cut or grazed by animals , some of the nitrogen , now surplus to requirements , is released into the soil where it can be used by the grass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #91:1>
The result is good crops for grazing by cattle and sheep , as well as hay or silage for the winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #92:1>
When grass/clover mixtures have been growing for about three years , a considerable amount of fertility has built up in the soil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #93:1>
There is enough goodness to allow the farmer to plough up the field and grow cereals or root crops .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #94:1>
Once this reserve of fertility has been exploited , it is time to return the land to grass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #95:1>
WEED CONTROL WITHOUT WEEDKILLERS
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #96:1>
Conventional farmers spend more money on weedkillers than any other pesticides .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #97:1>
Yet , at a pest control conference in 1989 , scientists were told that four of the major weed pests of cereals were out of control .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #98:1>
Weedkillers were no longer having an effect on sterile broom and black grass , for example , as they had developed resistance to the chemicals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #99:1>
Farmers have only themselves to blame for this state of affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #100:1>
The problem is easily solved if they rotate their crops :
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #101:1>
wild oats , for instance , cannot survive in a field of grass .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #102:1>
So , returning land to pasture every few years is far more effective than any herbicide in eliminating cereal weeds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #103:1>
In addition to crop rotation , organic farmers have other methods of controlling weeds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #104:1>
Perennials , such as thistles and docks that grow in pasture , can be killed by repeated ploughing and harrowing during a fallow summer period .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #105:1>
Each time the roots are brought to the surface , the sun dries and kills them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #106:1>
In between times they can be kept in check by topping with a mechanical mower .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #107:1>
Annual weeds of cereal crops are tackled by what is known as a &lsquo; weed strike &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #108:1>
The seedbed is prepared ten days to a fortnight before planting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #109:1>
This encourages the weeds to germinate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #110:1>
Then , when the crop is planted , the young seedlings are killed by off by the mechanical action of drilling and harrowing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #111:1>
Though some weeds may survive , and more may germinate , a well-sown crop of cereals will usually be able to suppress any that remain .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #112:1>
Organic farmers tend to choose cereal varieties with long straw and sow them at seed rates slightly higher than normal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #113:1>
The greater height and denseness helps to crowd out any competition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #114:1>
Horticulturists use somewhat different techniques .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #115:1>
Weeds might be kept down mechanically with tractors or hand<l->powered cultivations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #116:1>
Alternatively , flame weeders attached to the back of tractors can be used to kill weed seedlings without harming the crop .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #117:1>
Mulching materials such as straw or hay , or sheets of black polythene , can also be spread over the soil surface to prevent weeds from competing with crops .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #118:1>
CONTROLLING PESTS AND DISEASES
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #119:1>
Crop rotations are not only useful in controlling weeds , they are also the organic farmer 's most effective weapon against diseases , particularly those that live in the soil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #120:1>
Most diseases are specific to certain groups of plants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #121:1>
A root rot that might devastate peas and beans won't attack cabbages , and vice versa .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #122:1>
Moving crops from field to field around the farm prevents reservoirs of disease from building up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #123:1>
The same is true for many animal parasites which are kept under control by moving livestock to different pastures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-027 #124:1>
For example , worms that affect sheep are different from those that affect cattle .

A WORLD PROBLEM
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #12:1>
Spix 's macaw is , however , by no means the rarest or most threatened parrot in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #13:1>
In 1988 , the International Council for Bird Preservation ( ICBP ) produced a book called Birds to Watch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #14:1>
The simplicity of its title belied its stark message .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #15:1>
The publication was a global overview of threatened birds , and the facts and figures buried in the text made sobering reading .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #16:1>
Of 9,000 or so kinds of birds known to science , no less than 1,000 are to a varying degree at risk of extinction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #17:1>
This reflects a rapid de<l>terioration of the planet 's natural habitats , with the greatest effects being felt in the tropics &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #18:1>
Brazilian and Indonesian birds are suffering particularly badly with 121 and 126 threatened species respectively .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #19:1>
Parrots are depressingly well represented in this catalogue of gloom , with 71 in peril .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #20:1>
No less than 45 of the 145 kinds of parrots that occur between Mexico and Argentina are endangered .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #21:1>
As a proportion of the 333 species of parrots , the number at risk is appallingly high .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #22:1>
The reasons are trapping for the cage-bird trade and deforestation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #23:1>
Alas , we are the culprits .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #24:1>
THE CONQUEST OF THE FORESTS
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #25:1>
Most parrots live in lowland , tropical forests , and these are being cleared at a frightening rate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #26:1>
Anyone who has flown over the tropics will have seen the persistent pall of smoke which all too often signifies forests on the wane .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #27:1>
In those places , parrots are being deprived of their homes and livelihoods .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #28:1>
Such evergreen forests can occur anywhere between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where the temperature is relatively high and the rainfall sufficient to promote lush vegetation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #29:1>
Today , they blanket about 7 per cent of the world 's surface , but support nearly 50 per cent of the planet 's species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #30:1>
Even Christopher Columbus was impressed by the diversity of trees he saw on Hispaniola &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #31:1>
they were &lsquo; so tall that they seemed to touch the sky , green and lovely , some of them flowering , some bearing fruit , and some at another stage according to their nature &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #32:1>
We know today that a single hectare ( 2.5 acres ) of this rich arboreal growth may include a hundred kinds of trees each with its own interdependent fauna and flora .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #33:1>
Many of the plants have already bequeathed to us valuable food and drugs , and doubtless many more harbour pharmacological treasures of potential benefit to mankind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #34:1>
Even the Amazonian burity palm , often associated with Spix 's macaw , synthesises large quantities of vitamins A and C .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #35:1>
Indeed , the business of cataloguing what lives in these equatorial forests is still far from complete &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #36:1>
if a raucous bird like the El Oro parakeet can remain un<l>known until a decade ago , then clearly cohorts of invertebrates and plants must be waiting to be found .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #37:1>
Some scientists believe that the number may run into tens of millions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #38:1>
Unfortunately , species are dis<l>appearing faster than they can be found and properly described , be<l>cause the forests are diminishing year by year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #39:1>
A few thousand years ago , tropical rainforests covered 14 per cent of the globe , so we have already made substantial inroads into this pre<l>cious habitat .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #40:1>
Most of the damage has been inflicted over the last two centuries , but with a vengeance since World War II .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #41:1>
The damage var<l>ies from country to country .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #42:1>
Only half the original forest cover is left in Latin America &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #43:1>
South East Asia and the Pacific islands have retained 25 per cent &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #44:1>
West Africa has retained only 18 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #45:1>
How<l>ever , mainland India , Haiti and Sri Lanka have felled all their virgin rainforest , and within a short time the lowland forests will have van<l>ished from the Philippines , Guatemala , Panama , Sierra Leone , the Ivory Coast and the peninsula part of Malaysia and Thailand .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #46:1>
Signifi<l>cant tracts of pristine forest still exist in 37 countries , although 3 account for half the total &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #47:1>
Brazil boasts the lion 's share of one-third , with Zaire and Indonesia possessing one-tenth each .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #48:1>
Nevertheless , the speed with which rainforests are being felled is giving cause for concern .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #49:1>
According to one United Nations ' survey , some 6 million ha ( 23,000 sq miles ) are disappearing before the chain-saws every year - an area equivalent to West Virginia or Ireland .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #50:1>
To put this figure in more manageable terms , 12ha ( 30 acres ) are destroyed every minute of every day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #51:1>
There are even more pessimistic estimates .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #52:1>
In 1980 , the US National Academy of Sciences announced that an area the size of England , Scotland and Wales - 20 million ha ( 50 million acres ) - is felled or seriously degraded each year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #53:1>
Why ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #54:1>
The current burning of the Brazilian rainforest to make pasture has been called the greatest environmental folly ever to be unleashed on earth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #55:1>
But the fires are often stoked in part by western investment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #56:1>
What starts with the chain-saw ends up as minced beef for fast foods in North America &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #57:1>
it takes 5m 2 ( 55sq ft ) of forest to make a single ham<l>burger .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #58:1>
Sadly , the soil fails disastrously after a few years and is then fit to support only worthless scrub .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #59:1>
Timber worth $7 billion annually is also extracted from the forests , much of it going to Japan &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #60:1>
diamonds and gold are mined from the ground , and electricity flows from dams that drown great swathes of tropical trees .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #61:1>
The rivers of the Amazon Basin are capable of generating 100,000 megawatts equivalent to an oil well gushing 5 million barrels of oil every day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #62:1>
The scale of forest destruction to achieve this output of power will be 207,000ha ( 800sq miles ) of the Amazon forest &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #63:1>
Grenada , Barbados and Martinique would fit comfortably into the reservoir behind the dam .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #64:1>
But there may be another reason for flattening the forests , summed up by the slogan of Panama 's military rulers - la conquista de la selva ( the con<l>quest of the forest ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #65:1>
Jungles are slightly daunting places and need taming !
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #66:1>
Despite the fact that they are bursting with life , even supporting small groups of tribal people and helping to regulate the world 's climate , fiscally minded rulers feel uncomfortable with huge areas of &lsquo; non-productive &rsquo; land on their doorsteps .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #67:1>
Their reaction is usually to subjugate and &lsquo; im<l>prove &rsquo; it turning the natural resources of the forests into quick profits .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #68:1>
Is it to be wondered that the parrots which depend upon such places are under siege ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #69:1>
No parrot which depends upon rainforest will be completely safe until the current spate of destruction ceases , or until sufficiently large refuges are set aside .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #70:1>
In Mexico , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru , the clearance of mid-altitude forests has brought thirteen species of par<l>rots to a perilous state , including the recently discovered El Oro parakeet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #71:1>
The tropical forests in Madagascar are being wiped out , and so the survival of the world 's dullest parrot , the vasa , must be open to doubt .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #72:1>
Once the forests of the Philippines are finally cleared , the en<l>demic cockatoo will go with them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #73:1>
There is no question that several Caribbean amazons are threatened , not least by tropical cyclones which tear up tracts of forest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #74:1>
In 1988 , Hurricane Gilbert devastated Jamaica and the Caymans and damaged forest where four native par<l>rots live .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #75:1>
However , the amazons of the Lesser Antilles are most en<l>dangered by the pressure of people and their need to harness more land to grow crops .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #76:1>
PRECARIOUS PARROTS OF THE ANTILLES
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #77:1>
Like most of the larger parrots , adult amazons are long lived , slow to mature , and not particularly prolific breeders , so they are unable to ad<l>just to a rapid loss of tree cover .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #78:1>
If the birds are persecuted and trapped as well , the population does not easily recover .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #79:1>
In the case of the im<l>perial amazon , one of the most severely threatened of American parrots , there were only 150 left in Dominica in 1978 when the ICBP made its first checklist of rare birds &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #80:1>
now , there are less than 50 which have to share the island with 85,000 land-hungry people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #81:1>
Furthermore , it is almost impossible to guarantee their protection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #82:1>
Hurricanes are an ever present threat , and have already wiped out one population &semi; and the relentless conversion of primary forest into banana plantations has brought the numbers to a dangerously low level .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #83:1>
Those that survive are confined , with the more numerous red<l>necked amazon , to the region of Morne Diablotin and the Picard River .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #84:1>
Although a national park has been established at Morne Anglaise , it is doubtful whether any of these large parrots live within its boundary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #85:1>
However , the situation is not totally without hope .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #86:1>
In October 1986 , parrot enthusiasts meeting at Loro Parque , Tenerife , for the First International Parrot Convention , clubbed together and raised $22,000 to fund research into the life-style and requirements of the two beautiful Dominican amazons .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #87:1>
The money was donated to the ICBP to administer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #88:1>
One priority is to start an educational programme to win the hearts and minds of local people so that they will come to value their natural heritage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #89:1>
By focusing on the plight of the imperial parrot , they hope to develop a plan to protect and manage the bird 's last refuge .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #90:1>
Without the support of the Dominican people , the eagle-like amazon with its iridescent purple plumage will be gone forever by the end of the century .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #91:1>
The spectacular amazons endemic on St Lucia and St Vincent are more numerous , but they are still considered to be in a precarious state .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #92:1>
Both are confined to the vestigial forests in the mountainous centres of these lovely islands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #93:1>
The St Lucia amazon is a gorgeous parrot with verdant-green plumage , scarlet wing flashes and a blue face .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #94:1>
It has always been sought after for the pet trade .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #95:1>
However , aviculture has provided a stock of these birds as an insurance against the collapse of the population of 300 or so free-flying ones on the island .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #96:1>
In 1975 when the numbers in the wild were down to 100 , the St Lucia Government asked the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust to collect 7 parrot fledglings from their nests to establish a captive breed<l>ing programme in Jersey .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #97:1>
It came to fruition 7 years later when the first chick hatched .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #98:1>
St Lucia , meanwhile , had gained her independence and the parrot - affectionately called Jacquot - was named as the national bird and officially protected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #99:1>
Since then the numbers in the forests have slowly built up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #100:1>
Paul Butler , an English ornithologist , took the plight of the precious parrots to the schools and ordinary people by means of calypsos and billboards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #101:1>
To date , 14 young Jaquots have been fledged in Jersey and a pair is due to be flown back to St Lucia accompanied by the Prime Minister , Mr John Compton , to start the island 's own captive breeding programme .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #102:1>
The St Vincent amazon is that island 's national bird .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #103:1>
It is a rich tawny parrot with a long , three-barred tail in orange , blue and yellow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #104:1>
When they emerge from the tree canopy into the sun , the back<l->lighting through the orange wing feathers has been likened to the &lsquo; beauty of a stained glass window &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #105:1>
St Vincent amazons have always had to live with natural disasters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #106:1>
On 29 August 1980 , Hurricane Allen struck the island and devastated 80 per cent of the forest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #107:1>
Apart from cyclones , volcanic eruptions have added to the toll inflicted on the population by the plundering of nests for youngsters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #108:1>
In 1982 , the ICBP and the University of East Anglia mounted an expedition to assess the status of this species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #109:1>
They estimated that 420 or so parrots still lived in about 30sq km ( 12sq miles ) of forest in the centre of the island .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #110:1>
A further 23 parrots were in the houses of local people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #111:1>
Paul Butler , funded by the Philadelphia-based conservation organi<l>sation Rare Animals ' Relief Effort ( RARE ) , has also started to win the sympathy of the local people for the imperilled parrot , and to use it as the focus of a wider campaign to protect the remaining rainforest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #112:1>
Images of the birds are displayed all over the island on posters , T-shirts and car stickers &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #113:1>
a brewery has even put a parrot on the bottles of one of its products .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #114:1>
The island 's newspaper runs a weekly cartoon showing the adventures of &lsquo; Vincey &rsquo; in its struggle to survive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #115:1>
Butler is also waging his campaign in the schools of St Vincent &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #116:1>
the children en<l>thusiastically sing calypsos about the beleaguered birds while his wife dresses up as a pantomime parrot .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #117:1>
It 's all good fun , but the message strikes home .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #118:1>
And concern for the rare birds has led to concern for the health of the environment in general , the coral reefs in particular .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #119:1>
Should Jacquot 's forest home be destroyed , the reefs will be inundated with silt as the heavy tropical rain removes the soil from the unpro<l>tected surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-028 #120:1>
Butler will shortly start a similar campaign to help the imperial amazon on Dominica .

Earth , air , fire , water , oil and war
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #2:1>
Let 's get one thing straight to start with :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #3:1>
the Gulf oil<l->slick is not , as the newspapers have been saying so routinely that it has almost become a subtitle , &lsquo; the worst environmental disaster ever &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #4:1>
It is a very big oil-spill , and that 's quite enough to be getting on with .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #5:1>
Another point :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #6:1>
the burning oil-wells will not add significantly to the thing that probably is the worst environmental dis<l>aster ever , the greenhouse effect -
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #7:1>
that oil would have been burnt anyway &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #8:1>
but the smoke caused by the filthi<l>ness and the concentration of the burning could cause huge amounts of havoc over a very large part of the planet .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #9:1>
There might yet be other environmental horrors to spew forth from this war - nuclear fallout maybe , or a germ-warfare plague -
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #10:1>
but as we go to press , the slick and the fires are ones that are under way ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #11:1>
and in an effort to put a perspective on them , we present articles by Frances Dipper , a marine biologist living in Dubai , and Fred Pearce , an environmental journalist specialis<l>ing in problems of the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #12:1>
Keep your head down .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #13:1>
Don't panic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #14:1>
Read .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #15:1>
Think .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #16:1>
PART I
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #17:1>
Oil and water
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #18:1>
BY FRANCIS FRANCES DIPPER
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #19:1>
Living in the Gulf has meant living with oil .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #20:1>
Every morning , outside our villa in Dubai , the white beach is decorated with neat rows of black beads - the tide 's night harvest .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #21:1>
Some days are worse than others , but the oil 's always there .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #22:1>
For us , it 's just an inconvenience , resulting in messy shoes and feet , but for seabirds and other marine life it can spell death .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #23:1>
The amount of oil spilt accidentally or otherwise in Gulf waters each year is at least the size of a slick .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #24:1>
But because individual amounts are relatively small and the occurrence commonplace , not much fuss is made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #25:1>
Such spills produce local pollution on beaches and a steady kill of birds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #26:1>
One of the members of our local diving club once surfaced in an oil slick and said that he really felt for the birds :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #27:1>
the stuff matted his hair , filled his ears and tasted foul .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #28:1>
But the sea has remarkable self-cleaning properties , and given time , floating oil is worked on by marine bacteria and broken down .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #29:1>
I have even seen tar balls under water with seaweed growing on them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #30:1>
But faced with the present massive influx of oil , and with every likelihood of more to follow , we can expect considerable damage to fragile ecosystems as the natural cleaning systems become heavily overloaded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #31:1>
Arabian Gulf marine life already inhabits a stressful environment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #32:1>
Unlike the Red Sea , which reaches depths of more than 2,000m , the Gulf is very shallow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #33:1>
It has an average &arrowhead; depth of only 35m and a maximum of 100m .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #34:1>
This means that the water heats up and cools down along with the air temperatures .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #35:1>
So , for example , Saudi Arabian coastal waters can cool down to 10&degree;C in winter , and reach 35&degree;C in summer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #36:1>
The water is also more salty than the open sea , especially in partially enclosed bays and lagoons where evaporation is high .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #37:1>
The high salinity and wide temperature range are maintained because the Gulf has only a narrow connection to the Indian Ocean , which results in a limited exchange of water .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #38:1>
And it is this last fact which makes marine pollution of any type so serious .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #39:1>
In the past 20 years or so , as more scientists have been able to visit the Gulf , it has become obvious that marine life thrives here , despite the harsh conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #40:1>
After five years and many dives in Gulf waters , I have certainly seen enough to know that we are likely to lose unique marine life and habitats before we have really begun to study them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #41:1>
The main , and most visual , casualties in the present crisis will undoubtedly be the birds , mammals and reptiles that cannot avoid the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #42:1>
Beaches , too , will be badly damaged , especially shallow bays and intertidal sand/mudflats , which are particularly prevalent along the northern and western sides of the inner Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #43:1>
They are of enormous biological importance , and are also highly vulnerable to oil pollution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #44:1>
Mangroves are also found in sheltered bays .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #45:1>
They are extremely productive biologically and act as nursery areas for fish and shellfish .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #46:1>
Coastal infilling and direct exploitation have already affected them badly , and they are rated as the shoreline habitat most vulnerable to oil pollution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #47:1>
Their aerial roots act as oil traps , with the result that they suffocate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #48:1>
Only two mangrove sites remain on the Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia , one small one in Bahrain and odd ones in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #49:1>
The densest stands fringe the Gulf of Hormuz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #50:1>
The number of barrels involved in an oil-spill is only one measure of its potential for actual damage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #51:1>
Other factors include the ingredients of the oil , the salinity and depth of water , the local average temperatures , the time of year , the strength of the waves and currents , the relative purity of the environment , the types of life that the oil contacts , and the speed and effectiveness of the clean-up effort .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #52:1>
The Exxon Valdez spill , for example , was worse than several of the larger ones because the cold water inhibited evaporation and bacterial breakdown and made the oil almost impossible to skim up , because Prince William Sound was so pristine to start with , because there were so many birds and mammals in the area that could be killed by oil ( being smothered and choked , being poisoned , losing insulation by fur and feather , getting weighed down and drowning , and dying of lesions and infections ) , and because the initial response to the accident was so slow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #53:1>
And the Ixtoc blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico - even though it gushed for months - did less harm than it might have because it was well out at sea and in deep , choppy , warm waters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #54:1>
Warm water is about all the current spill has going for it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #55:1>
The oil 's toxic volatile constituents have evaporated , leaving a sluggish , smothering mousse that , where it doesn't wash up , will eventually congeal and sink .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #56:1>
Otherwise , the situation looks bad :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #57:1>
the Gulf is shallow , placid , very salty and almost entirely enclosed ( factors which have generated a rich plankton supporting a rich ecosystem ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #58:1>
there are vulnerable populations of several species , and a number of very fragile ecosystems &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #59:1>
and the fact that the oil was poured into the sea deliberately ( a world first , certainly ) was compounded by the fact that it seemed to come as a complete surprise :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #60:1>
the response was as slow as Alaska 's .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #61:1>
Dugongs
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #62:1>
Just as worrying are the unseen poisoning effects of the oil on the plankton and fish in the water column and the life on and in the seabed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #63:1>
Dugongs , or sea cows , are declining in numbers throughout their fairly wide geographical range .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #64:1>
In the Gulf , we are lucky to have probably the largest population in the western hemisphere - perhaps as many as 7,000 -
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #65:1>
but numbers are thought to be declining .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #66:1>
These gentle , shy creatures inhabit the shallow coastal areas where the seagrass on which they feed grows .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #67:1>
Unfortunately , my first sighting of a dugong was of a dead one in the fish market in Abu Dhabi - a bustling , smelly Aladdin 's Cave of marine life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #68:1>
Though dugongs are no longer hunted deliberately for food , they increasingly fall foul of fishermen 's gillnets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #69:1>
The locals call them arus al bahr , the bride of the sea , perhaps a reference to the mermaid legend .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #70:1>
But sea cow is a much better description of this lumbering grazer of the underwater pastures , one of the world 's two entirely herbivorous marine mammals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #71:1>
An aerial survey carried out in 1986 by MEPA ( Meteorology and Environmental Protection Administration of Saudi Arabia ) pinpointed the Gulf of Salwah , lying between the coastline of Saudi Arabia and Qatar , and the area to the west of Abu Dhabi as supporting the main concentrations of dugongs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #72:1>
An unusually large herd of more than 600 was photographed at that time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #73:1>
Archaeological excavations near Abu Dhabi dating back 4,000 years or so uncovered large numbers of dugong bones , suggesting that sea-cow steaks were a staple diet in this region .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #74:1>
Dugongs are true mammals and must surface to breathe , and so they will inevitably be war casualties :
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #75:1>
38 bodies were washed ashore when Iraq blew up the Nowruz oil platform in 1983 and created a major oil-spill .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #76:1>
How many are killed this time will depend on how far the oil-slicks travel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #77:1>
Dugongs only produce one calf every three to six years and do not breed until they are 10 to 15 years old .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #78:1>
Badly affected populations would therefore take years to recover , if at all .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #79:1>
As much of a threat is the smothering by oil of the seagrass on which the dugongs feed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #80:1>
Seagrass grows in sand , silt or mud and resembles an underwater meadow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #81:1>
It needs light to grow and is therefore not found much below 10m .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #82:1>
It is found , albeit patchily , along the whole of the western Gulf from Kuwait to Ras al Khaimah .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #83:1>
Sheltered bays and lagoons support the best meadows , because they provide rich sediments in which the grass can root .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #84:1>
The seagrass acts as a nursery for the shrimp Penaeus semisulcatus , the young of which live and grow in its shelter before migrating into deeper water , to become , among other things , the basis for an important fishery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #85:1>
The seagrass also supports a wide variety of other plants and animals , including pearl oysters , which attach to the grass as they settle out of the plankton .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #86:1>
Oil entering bays and inlets is liable to remain there much longer than on the open seas , and if it gets into the soft sediments in these areas , it cannot be broken down as easily and will remain toxic for much longer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #87:1>
Large kills of juvenile fish , shrimp and shellfish have resulted in the past from such circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #88:1>
Though seagrass has been observed to survive quite happily just offshore from beaches badly polluted by oil , if sufficient quantities of oil reach it , the dugongs are likely to face starvation as well as oiling .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #89:1>
Turtles and sea-snakes
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #90:1>
Another large animal dependent mainly on seagrass for its food is the green turtle Chelonia mydas , the Gulf 's commonest turtle , which can be seen in small numbers throughout the year all along the coastline of southern Arabia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #91:1>
I have met these lumbering giants under water while exploring the seagrass beds in the lagoons off Ras al Khaimah .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #92:1>
There , unknowingly , they were busy eating a species of seagrass for which there was previously only a single eighteenth-century record from the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #93:1>
The status of the populations of green turtle and the less abundant hawksbill is not known , but the animals have been heavily exploited .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #94:1>
Their breeding grounds on the mainland have been mostly wiped out by disturbance , and their island sites are often overrun with rats , mice and other introduced predators .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #95:1>
Most of my sightings of turtles have been of animals coming to the surface to breathe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #96:1>
This is the time they are most vulnerable to pollution - and turtles which have ingested oil can take a distressingly long time to die .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #97:1>
A far greater threat , though , is to their breeding grounds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #98:1>
The Gulf turtle population breeds mainly on four small islands - Karan , Jana , Kurayn and Jurayd , off the Saudi Arabian coast .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #99:1>
These are also critical because of their rich coral reefs and importance to bird colonies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #100:1>
Luckily , the breeding season for green turtles does not begin until May and June , and for the smaller hawksbills , until April and May .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #101:1>
But it 's unlikely that enough oil-booms can be placed around the islands to protect them , and so it is possible that those turtles which escape the slick will find themselves with nowhere to breed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #102:1>
As far as sea-snakes are concerned , at least nine species occur in and around the Gulf area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #103:1>
All must surface to breathe and so may be affected by the slick .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #104:1>
Worst affected is likely to be the yellow-bellied sea-snake , which feeds on the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #105:1>
Dolphins and whales
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #106:1>
Dolphins are still a common sight in the Gulf ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #107:1>
and one of my most memorable experiences was watching them from the prow of an Arabian fishing boat , or dhow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #108:1>
Two sleek , grey bodies were effortlessly riding our bow-wave just a foot or so beneath the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #109:1>
Every couple of minutes , they sheered off to one side and exhibited their prowess with short leaps and fast surges .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #110:1>
These were Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis , their name deriving from the hump which sometimes supports the dorsal fin .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #111:1>
Unlike the bottlenosed dolphin Tursiops truncatus , which is the commonest Gulf species , the humpback has a long , thin snout , often tipped white .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #112:1>
The common dolphin Delphinus delphis and the finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides also occur in the Gulf , but in very much smaller numbers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #113:1>
Large cetaceans such as humpback whales , orcas and blue whales are occasionally seen (
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #114:1>
there have been unconfirmed reports of at least three collisions between humpback whales and warships in the south of the Gulf ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #115:1>
In the past few years many dolphins have drowned in fishing nets , but the effect this may be having on numbers is unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #116:1>
The 1983 Nowruz spill resulted in unspecified but significant numbers of dolphins being washed up dead on the Saudi Arabian coast .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #117:1>
Though dolphins can sense an oil-slick and will move away from it , the size of the current spill guarantees that it will catch some animals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-029 #118:1>
Possibly the most vulnerable will be the humpback dolphins , which have less of a tendency to roam and which are more often encountered feeding in shallower , inshore water .

Understanding the plant kingdom
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #3:1>
Only a few of the visitors to Kew Gardens realise that the collection of plants that they enjoy seeing is , first and foremost , a scientific resource .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #4:1>
The living plants and preserved material collected on expeditions provide the basis for a wide-ranging research programme with the aim of increasing our understanding of the plant kingdom -
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #5:1>
not least to discover how to keep it safe from destruction and how to use it sensibly for the benefit of humanity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #6:1>
The Herbarium :
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #7:1>
cataloguing the world 's plants
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #8:1>
In the Herbarium at Kew , botanists study plants from all over the world in order to identify and name them and to provide methods of helping other people recognise the plants around them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #9:1>
It is here that dried specimens end their journey -
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #10:1>
and today , the main collection comprises some six million seed plants , ferns and larger fungi .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #11:1>
Dried plants retain many characteristics of the living specimens but take up a lot less space and need far less looking after.
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #12:1>
Each one that arrives at the Herbarium is accompanied by full field notes , giving details of features that may have been lost on drying , such as petal colour and scent , as well as other information about the plant not evident from the specimen , such as its size , habitat and uses by local people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #13:1>
This combination of dried specimen and field notes can provide almost as much information as the living plant itself .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #14:1>
The Herbarium 's collection of fungi is the largest , richest and most important in the world , containing over 600,000 specimens - mushrooms , toadstools , cup fungi and examples of stem and leaf fungal diseases.
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #15:1>
When collected on expeditions , fungi are dried but not pressed as this would destroy their overall shape .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #16:1>
New specimens of all types of plants arrive at Kew at a rate of about 45,000 a year .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #17:1>
Before entering the main Herbarium building , they are all deep<l->frozen for two days to ensure that any pests are killed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #18:1>
Each one is then allocated to a botanist for identification .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #19:1>
Telling one plant from another
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #20:1>
Taxonomy is a practical science , used to distinguish , name and arrange plants and other organisms in a logical way , and it is a prerequisite for any biological study .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #21:1>
When an unidentified flowering plant or fern arrives at the Herbarium , it is usually fairly easy to assign it to the correct family , using obvious characteristics of flowers , fruits and foliage.
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #22:1>
It is then sent to the taxonomist dealing with that family , who will discover what genus it belongs to and what species it is .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #23:1>
Studies of the plant 's structure , its chromosomes and its biochemical constituents can provide additional information to be used in its identification .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #24:1>
This process of identifying a plant from its most general characteristics to its most specific - from family to genus to species - and arranging it in a particular system is called &lsquo; systematic classification &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #25:1>
When taxonomists begin the identification of a fungus , they look at the size , shape and colour of the above<l->ground fruiting body , as well as any colour changes that occur when the flesh of this is exposed to air .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #26:1>
The fruiting body 's smell and , in some cases , its taste , as well as the fungus 's habitat , are all noted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #27:1>
Sometimes , for accurate identification , the fungal spores have to be examined under the microscope &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #28:1>
their size , form , ornamentation and chemical characteristics can often provide vital clues .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #29:1>
Storage and arrangement
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #30:1>
After it has been identified and named , a plant is mounted on a herbarium sheet so that it can be studied easily and will not be damaged in storage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #31:1>
It is carefully arranged on the sheet so that its characteristic features are clearly displayed , with both sides of leaves and flowers showing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #32:1>
Delicate flowers are protected by translucent paper flaps , and parts that have been detached for study are placed in an attached envelope .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #33:1>
A label gives details of the plant 's name , who collected it , the collector 's number and any field notes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #34:1>
Then the sheet is returned to the botanist , who will place it in the correct sequence in the collection .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #35:1>
Additional plant material - especially complex or delicate flowers such as those of orchids and cacti - is stored in &lsquo; herbarium spirit &rsquo; , an alcohol-based mixture containing a preservative .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #36:1>
Material stored in this way retains its three-dimensional shape for future study .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #37:1>
There are also separate collections of seeds , fruits and other dry bulky material , held in boxes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #38:1>
Before plants can be used as reference sources for the identification of new specimens , they must be arranged in such a way that the information can actually be retrieved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #39:1>
In the Herbarium , plants are placed in the correct families and , within those , in the correct genus .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #40:1>
Within each genus , however , they are arranged geographically .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #41:1>
Thus , in the Herbarium there is an attempt to have a readily accessible , representative sample of the world 's vegetation , highlighting its diversity and distribution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #42:1>
Taxonomy at the microscopic level
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #43:1>
Pollen grains can vary a great deal in structure and appearance from species to species , and these characteristics can be used to identify a particular one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #44:1>
Under powerful electron microscopes , the Herbarium 's Palynology Unit can survey a pollen grain 's surface ornamentation , the position of its apertures and the arrangement of layers in its walls .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #45:1>
Pollen identification carried out by the Unit has been used to determine different types of honey , as well as the sources of objects contaminated by pollen grains - for instance , to aid forensic scientists in obtaining criminal evidence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #46:1>
Another aspect of the Unit 's work is the identification of fossilised pollen grains .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #47:1>
The complex substance that makes up the grains ' walls is very resistant to decay , and as a result , grains are preserved in the soil over many millenia .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #48:1>
When such grains have been identified , researchers can discover which types of plants formed the vegetation of a particular area at a particular time and can look for evidence of climatic change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #49:1>
The Jodrell Laboratory :
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #50:1>
experimental research
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #51:1>
In the north-east corner of the Gardens , close to the Alpine House , stands the Jodrell Laboratory , the site of much experimental research .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #52:1>
In contrast to the Herbarium , where researchers are mainly concerned with the external appearance of plants , work in the Jodrell is directed towards their microscopic and chemical characteristics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #53:1>
Plant anatomy :
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #54:1>
the surface and beyond
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #55:1>
Using light and electron microscopes , researchers can examine plants at various magnifications to study their tissues or even individual cells .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #56:1>
The Jodrell 's Anatomy Section now has a reference collection of some 70,000 microscope slides of sections sliced through the wood , leaves and stems of plants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #57:1>
This provides a basis for systematic research and also a means of identifying unknown species by their microscopic structure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #58:1>
As well as their internal structure , plants ' surface features may provide clues to relationships between species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #59:1>
The aloes and haworthias , for example , have characteristic stomas , tiny pores in the outer layer of leaves .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #60:1>
Because hybrids occasionally show some of the surface features inherited from both parents , it may be possible to determine a hybrid 's origins by examining these .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #61:1>
The production of seeds by a plant is dependent on three processes : first , pollination &semi; then , fertilisation of the ovule ( embryo sac ) by fusion of the female gamete ( egg cell ) with a male gamete from a pollen grain to produce an embryo &semi; and finally , development and maturation of the seed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #62:1>
Sometimes plants have incompatibility systems that prevent pollination or fertilisation unless suitable sources of pollen can be found .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #63:1>
In the Transmission Electron Microscope ( TEM ) Unit at the Jodrell , the stigmas , styles and ovaries of flowers are studied , both for taxonomic purposes and to understand how the ovule is fertilised so that clues can be found about the point at which incompatibility systems operate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #64:1>
This is particularly important for threatened species , where the production of seed is vital .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #65:1>
Physiology :
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #66:1>
structure and function
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #67:1>
The timber trees of South-east Asia , harvested directly from their natural habitat , provide a large proportion of the world 's tropical hardwoods .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #68:1>
However , few of them can be grown on managed plantations because their often large and fleshy seeds , which are produced unpredictably once every three to seven years , die quickly if they are dried or stored moist without adequate oxygen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #69:1>
Thus they cannot be transported or stored from harvest to planting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #70:1>
Researchers in the Jodrell 's Physiology Section are investigating these and other plants with such &lsquo; recalcitrant &rsquo; seeds to discover how seed survival is controlled and how this control can be manipulated so that tropical hardwood forests can be managed as a renewable and ecologically stable resource .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #71:1>
The Physiology Section is also involved in the work of the World Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #72:1>
( see Chapter 4 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #73:1>
Biochemistry :
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #74:1>
plants as chemical factories
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #75:1>
In addition to carbohydrates , lipids and proteins , plants produce many other chemicals , including some whose biological functions are unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #76:1>
These compounds - called secondary metabolites - may have a physiological effect either in the plant itself or on other organisms , possibly protecting the plant by deterring predators such as insects , or inhibiting competing plant species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #77:1>
This biological activity can be harnessed for the benefit of people - in , say , agriculture or medicine - and because these secondary metabolites are often found only in one group of closely related plants , they can also be useful taxonomic markers .

<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #105:1>
In the Biochemistry Section , researchers looking into this aspect of plants direct their work not only towards species of interest to other researchers in the Jodrell and the Herbarium .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #106:1>
They also study certain plants ( and related species ) that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine , and those that grow abundantly , but for which there is , as yet , no apparent use - for instance , &lsquo; weeds &rsquo; and aquatic plants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #107:1>
Extracts from these plants are tested for their activity in a number of biological systems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #108:1>
For instance , a chemical may be screened against enzymes implicated in disease , such as glycosidase &semi; against disease<l->causing organisms , such as the malarial parasite &semi; or against pests , including locusts and bruchid beetles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #109:1>
One such screening has shown that certain plant extracts can reduce nematode ( eelworm ) damage to plant roots .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #110:1>
If any activity is detected , the compounds responsible are isolated and their structures determined using sophisticated methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #111:1>
If an unusual compound is found only in two species within a family , it is quite likely that those two plants are descended from a common ancestor and thus are closely related .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #112:1>
Alternatively , certain combinations of compounds may be peculiar to particular species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #113:1>
For instance , the aloes contain some 80 phenolic compounds , of which only 20 have been identified .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #114:1>
These compounds provide a &lsquo; chemical fingerprint &rsquo; characteristic of each species or group of species , and a hybrid between such plants may contain the &lsquo; fingerprints &rsquo; of the parent plants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #115:1>
Cytogenetics : inside the nucleus
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #116:1>
In the Cytogenetics Section , researchers study chromosomes , which are located in the nucleus of every cell of a plant ( and of other living things ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #117:1>
Chromosomes are made up of protein and DNA , and the latter comprises the cell 's genetic material .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #118:1>
The chromosomes with their DNA encode a blueprint that will define all of a plant 's characteristics , although these may be modified by environmental factors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #119:1>
In general , each plant species has a certain number of chromosomes ( although there are exceptions ) , and these , in turn , have a characteristic appearance in terms of shape , size , position of constrictions and light and dark bands ( seen after staining ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #120:1>
This unique appearance is known as the karyotype , and karyotypes are important in taxonomic and evolutionary studies , which seek to discover how species are related .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #121:1>
Cytogenetic research is also valuable to plant breeders , because it may indicate the probability of achieving viable hybrids in plant crosses .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #122:1>
Many of the problems under investigation in this part of the Jodrell relate to a group of plants known as the petaloid monocotyledons , which include the daffodils , aloes and tradescantias .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #123:1>
Another area of research is &lsquo; population cytogenetics &rsquo; - the study of chromosome variability occurring within and between populations of particular species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #124:1>
Such studies , combined with our knowledge of breeding systems and ecology , are important when dealing with scattered or dwindling populations of threatened plant species .
<ICE-GB:W2B-030 #125:1>
They can also be used to assess the ways in which plant populations cope with changes in the environment , as well as how new species develop .

JD800
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #2:1>
Front-panel knobs and sliders make a welcome comeback on Roland 's latest professional synth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #3:1>
But does the JD800 really have anything new to offer ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #4:1>
Review by Simon Trask .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #5:1>
IN THE YEARS since Yamaha launched the DX7 , digital synthesis and digital parameter access programming have seemingly become inextricably intertwined - leaving the old analogue style of programming , with its dedicated knobs and sliders , consigned to the dustbin of history .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #6:1>
Yet , let 's face it , when the knobs and sliders disappeared , a lot of the fun disappeared from programming along with them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #7:1>
Synth players traumatised not only by the rigours of FM synthesis but also by the intricacies of Yamaha 's programming system began turning to computer-based editor/librarian software , and a new industry was born .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #8:1>
In the ensuing years , manufacturers have tried many variations on the digital parameter access formula , and with practice it 's possible to move around today 's editing systems with great speed - but most synth players would agree that there 's simply no substitute for the immediacy of dedicated knobs and sliders , which not only provide equal and immediate access to all synthesis parameters , but allow you to adjust more than one parameter at the same time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #9:1>
In programming , getting the sound you want typically involves constantly moving to and fro between different parameters , fine-tuning them against one another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #10:1>
By forcing you to focus on one parameter at a time , digital parameter access systems aren't well-suited to this approach -
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #11:1>
and as a result you have to waste a lot of time and energy poking away at buttons to move you around different parameters in an LCD page , climb up and down hierarchical programming levels and jump between selected pages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #12:1>
We 've all been there .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #13:1>
The result is that , for most synth players today , &ldquo; getting the sound you want &lsquo; doesn't involve programming so much as hunting through an ever<l->growing library of pre-programmed sounds provided by the manufacturer and/or third-party companies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #14:1>
The so-called &ldquo; preset mentality &rdquo; has taken hold - yet not to the extent that musicians don't still yearn for a return to the old analogue-style front panels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #15:1>
Such yearning isn't the sole preserve of the old-timers , either .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #16:1>
Today 's young dance musicians cut their teeth on MC202s , SH101s , Juno 106s and the like , and have been equally vocal in calling for a return to the knobs and sliders .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #17:1>
Manufacturers may have hoped that the clamour would die out , but musicians just wouldn't let it lie .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #18:1>
In the past there may well have been technical restrictions which made it impractical to provide simultaneous access to all synthesis parameters on digital synths .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #19:1>
But in the past manufacturers have also responded to requests for a return to dedicated knobs and sliders with claims that &ldquo; it would cost too much &rdquo; and &ldquo; there are far too many parameters these days for it to be practical &rdquo; - claims which never really rang true .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #20:1>
The JD800 is proof that if the will is there , so is the way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #21:1>
Not only is Roland 's new synth no more expensive than other professional synths on the market , but the company have managed to fit knobs , sliders and switches for every synthesis parameter onto its front panel - and they haven't had to simplify the synthesis architecture in order to do so , either .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #22:1>
But while the JD800 ( Jupiter Digital , perhaps ? ) gets full marks for its &ldquo; resuscitation &rdquo; of analogue<l->style programming , is there really anything else new about it , or have Roland merely taken the opportunity to dress up an all-too-familiar instrument in new clothes - and , if they have , does it matter when the JD800 has such an appealing dress sense ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #23:1>
OF KNOBS AND SLIDERS
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #24:1>
THE JD800 MAKES 69 synthesis parameters available on dedicated front-panel knobs , sliders and switches .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #25:1>
These are all the parameters which make up its synthesis architecture of oscillator , filter , amplifier plus related envelopes and two assignable LFOs collectively known as a Tone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #26:1>
However , if you take into account the fact that these 69 parameters are duplicated across the four Tones which make up a JD800 Patch , the total number of parameters accessible in this manner is 276 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #27:1>
The four Tone buttons located on the synth 's angled System/Patch control panel , near the left<l->hand end of the synth 's front panel , allow you to very quickly assign any Tone or combination of Tones to the knobs , sliders and switches for editing purposes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #28:1>
Successive presses of these buttons assign and deassign each Tone , with pinpoint LEDs built into each button blinking to indicate that the relevant Tone is assigned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #29:1>
When you 're up to speed on these you can assign a new Tone or combination of Tones within a couple of seconds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #30:1>
The Tone buttons also have a second function , Tone muting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #31:1>
In this case , successive presses of the four buttons turn the Tones on and off , while the built-in LEDs indicate the on/off condition of each Tone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #32:1>
A button labelled Layer/Active , handily located just below the Tone buttons , allows you to switch between the two functions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #33:1>
So that you can tell which function is selected , the LEDs for the mute function don't blink when lit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #34:1>
The on/off status of each Tone for both mute and assign functions is automatically stored when you Write a Patch into memory , and recalled whenever you subsequently select the Patch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #35:1>
So , for instance , if you know that you want to do a live sound edit on one of several enabled Tones within a Patch , you can set Tone assign to default to that one Tone when the Patch is selected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #36:1>
Equally , if you want to be sure that a Patch can't be changed during performance ( by accidentally knocking a slider , for example ) you can deassign all four Tones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #37:1>
Knob , slider and switch settings on the JD800 are absolute , which means that editing a parameter causes all assigned Tones to be set to the same value .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #38:1>
This comes in useful if you want to program the same amplitude envelope for several Tones - by assigning the relevant Tones to the front panel you only need to set the envelope parameters once .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #39:1>
Incidentally , all your front-panel synthesis edits can optionally be transmitted via MIDI as SysEx data , and so recorded into a MIDI sequencer for subsequent playback .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #40:1>
Tucked away in the upper left-hand corner of the main editing panel are four sliders collectively known as the Palette .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #41:1>
D70 owners will be familiar with the term .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #42:1>
These sliders are assigned to Tones 1-4 , and allow you to edit each Tone individually , regardless of which Tones are assigned to the dedicated parameter sliders ( knob and switch parameters can't be edited from the Palette ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #43:1>
Because the Palette sliders aren't dedicated to a particular parameter , you have to select which one you want to edit &semi; there are several ways of doing this , but on balance the best way is to use the Page up/down buttons to &ldquo; scroll &rdquo; to it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #44:1>
Palette and dedicated sliders take effect the moment you move them , causing the parameter value to jump from the programmed value to whatever value is indicated by the physical position of the slider .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #45:1>
Depending on the parameter and on how far apart the two values are , this jump can be quite noticeable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #46:1>
But at least something happens immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #47:1>
By contrast , a D70 Palette slider only starts to work once you 've passed it across the programmed value - you avoid the jumps , but at the expense of immediate response .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #48:1>
Inevitably on any programmable synth the physical positions of the sliders aren't going to bear any relation to the actual programmed values when you call up a different patch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #49:1>
On the JD800 this applies even more so because you can call different Tones onto the sliders within a Patch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #50:1>
In fact , as you switch between different Tones while programming , it 's all too easy to forget which Tone , if any , the physical position of a slider refers to .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #51:1>
For some reason it 's still tempting to think that the slider positions do actually correlate to the programmed values , but , when you call a Patch up , the sliders tell you as little as a digital parameter access synth does .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #52:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #53:1>
Dedicated sliders which can set positive and negative values helpfully have a centre detent to help you identify the zero ( central ) position , though in some cases they 're so slight that you can easily miss them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #54:1>
The sliders themselves have just the right degree of resistance in their movement , giving them a solid but responsive feel and allowing you to make subtle values changes by nudging them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #55:1>
DIGITAL ACCESS
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #56:1>
THE JD800 'S STRENGTH lies not just in its return to analogue-style programming but in the way that it combines this approach with digital parameter access .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #57:1>
While the knobs and sliders take care of the sound programming , digital parameter access deals with the other aspects of the modern synth , such as MIDI and multitimbral setups .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #58:1>
However , there is one aspect of sound programming which isn't on the knobs and sliders : effects programming .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #59:1>
Running along a strip just above the keyboard are some familiar features of digital parameter access : an Exit button , a data entry slider and increment/decrement buttons , a two-digit LED display for the currently-selected program number , two backlit LCD windows , Page up/down and Cursor left/right buttons , an Int/Card selector button , eight Bank and eight Number buttons for Patch selection , and buttons providing direct access to Compare , Copy , Manual , Write and Data Transfer functions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #60:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #61:1>
Using Compare you can check on the unedited parameter values , while Copy allows you to copy all the data of a Tone to any of the other Tones , and Manual allows you to copy the parameter values determined by the current phsyical physical positions of the front-panel knobs , sliders and switches to any of the four Tones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #62:1>
Unfortunately , Copy and Manual don't allow you to limit their operations to selected synthesis components ( amplitude envelope only , for example ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #63:1>
The right-hand LCD window is reserved for displaying the four Tone values of the currently-selected synthesis parameter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #64:1>
You can use the Page up/down buttons to scroll through the parameters which , for instance , allows you to select a parameter for the Palette sliders or check on the programmed values of a parameter without having to move the relevant slider or knob .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #65:1>
The left-hand LCD window normally displays the mode ( Single or Multi ) , the currently-selected Patch and the MIDI transmit channel ( together with the Part number in Multi mode ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #66:1>
However , this LCD is also used for displaying parameters associated with some of the buttons on the angled control panel mentioned earlier .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #67:1>
These include Patch Edit Common and Effects , and Multi Part Edit , Special Setup and Effects .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #68:1>
When you select these modes , the Page up/down buttons allow you to step through their software pages , while the data entry controllers allow you to edit the parameters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #69:1>
In most cases there 's one parameter per page , but where there are more the Cursor left/right buttons come into play .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #70:1>
All in all , Roland seem to have found a good balance of function buttons and software pages , so that the different functional areas of the JD800 are clearly presented and you don't have to get too deep into hierarchical levels or endless reams of software pages - not something which can be said for all Roland 's instruments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #71:1>
Perhaps someone at Roland has been studying colour psychology , because the company have taken the unusual step of using orange pinpoint LEDs ( associated with the front-panel switch parameters ) , an orange two-digit LED and orange LCD backlighting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #72:1>
Apart from being easy on the eyes , the resulting orange glow - particularly from the LCD windows - conveys an impression of warmth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #73:1>
Couple this with the associations of old-style analogue programming and you begin to wonder if you 're being manipulated on a subconscious level .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #74:1>
Or maybe I 'm just being cynical .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #75:1>
ANALOGUE REBORN ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #76:1>
LET 'S GET ONE thing clear .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #77:1>
The JD800 's front panel may be laid out &ldquo; analogue-style &rdquo; but the actual synthesis processing it employs is wholly digital .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #78:1>
Yet it 's not only the knobs and sliders which recall the analogue synthesisers of old .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #79:1>
The JD800 's synthesis architecture bears a remarkable resemblance to the traditional model of analogue synthesis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #80:1>
But this is no return to a former way of doing things .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #81:1>
In truth , the classic architecture of oscillator , filter and amplifier with envelope and LFO modulators has always remained at the heart of the synthesiser .
<ICE-GB:W2B-031 #82:1>
Yamaha with FM synthesis are the exception , of course - except that even they introduced digital filters when they designed their SY77 flagship synth .

Is Anybody There ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #2:1>
A C Denison 's Phantom Phone could drive your friends crazy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #3:1>
After all , who can ignore a ringing telephone ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #4:1>
I am sure that the vast majority of electronics enthusiasts will certainly own a sizeable conglomeration of the most wonderful odds and ends , tucked carefully away in every conceivable corner of the home just waiting for that rainy day that somehow never seems to come .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #5:1>
Every now and then a tidy up is in order , if only to muse for a while over the priceless cache .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #6:1>
It was on one such occasion that I came upon a broken , one piece telephone , long since discarded and completely forgotten about .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #7:1>
Being blessed with a shade of inspiration and a suitably strange sense of humour , it wasn't long before the innards were plucked out and replaced with a slightly different circuit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #8:1>
The end product is the Phantom Phone , guaranteed to drive all but the most saintly to the brink of despair .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #9:1>
When the instrument is place placed on a hard , flat surface , the hookswitch will initiate a timing cycle of around two minutes , after which it will start to ring , sounding just like the real thing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #10:1>
When a suitable victim tries to answer the incoming call , the ringer will stop the instant the phone is picked up ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #11:1>
but of course , there is no-one on the other end of the line because there is no line .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #12:1>
Strangely enough , some victims of this harmless prank never seem to notice the total absence of side tone or even the fact there is no line cord .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #13:1>
They simply replace the phone with a puzzled expression only to be caught again two minutes later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #14:1>
Depending on the patience of the hapless victim , the process can continue ad infinitum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #15:1>
Ring A Ding Ding
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #16:1>
The earliest method of one telephone set attracting the attention of another was for the caller to literally shout down the handset , Hello or Ahoy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #17:1>
Understandably , this unlikely arrangement soon gave way to a more convenient and practical way of signalling , the Telephone Ringer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #18:1>
Patented in 1878 by Thomas Watson , ( Alexander Graham Bell 's assistant ) , the electromagnetic bell is rugged , reliable and loud enough to be heard for some appreciable distance ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #19:1>
an important consideration in days when one telephone per household seemed to be the accepted standard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #20:1>
The resonant qualities of the bell type ringer created a sense of urgency to spur the subscriber into answering the incoming call without undue delay , a desirable aspect from the Telephone Company 's point of view as ringing ties up essential equipment and makes no profit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #21:1>
It would seem clear that the telephone bell was a major step forward from the original method of shouting at the handset but an underlying snag was to emerge as the telephone network gained momentum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #22:1>
In an office environment for example , where a large number of phones were in use , it was no easy task to distinguish which phone was ringing when they all sounded very much alike .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #23:1>
It was apparent that some form of individuality was essential if the world was to remain sane ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #24:1>
and so it is reasonable to expect some considerable development to have taken place in this particular problem area , which has indeed been the case .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #25:1>
Although the telecommunications system has remained with relatively few changes in its basic concept for a hundred years or more , the ringer has emerged today as a remarkably versatile part of telephone equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #26:1>
Surprisingly , the humble bell is still very much in evidence today and cannot be denied its place when a more resounding quality of sound is required .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #27:1>
However , electronic ringing circuitry clearly dominates the field with modern preferences for lighter , more compact equipment in keeping with up to date domestic and business environments .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #28:1>
It is a relatively simple matter to implement a low cost electronic ringer using just one transistor , a piezo electric transducer and a few passive components .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #29:1>
However , advances in integrated ringer technology provide ICs which contain virtually all the necessary elements for a complete ringer circuit and can offer other features as well .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #30:1>
The ringing pitch can normally be made infinitely variable so that one telephone can be easily identified from a number of others when a call is incoming .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #31:1>
Other useful options include multitone ringers , to positively identify a special line and an integral control which will increase the ringer volume if a call remains unanswered for more than a few minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #32:1>
Although electronic circuitry can provide the audible higher frequency sound of the ringer , the incoming AC signal , typically 75V at around 25Hz will usually control the low frequency component , giving the characteristic warble effect commonly recognized as the modern telephone sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #33:1>
This low frequency component is the one aspect of electronic ring generation that cannot normally be altered .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #34:1>
Circuit Description
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #35:1>
The electronic telephone ringer in its basic form consists of an oscillator set to run within the easily heard AF ( audio frequency ) speechband - around 600Hz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #36:1>
This is gated and modulated by an incoming low frequency AC ringing signal in the region of 25Hz to produce a Trimphone type sound , characteristic of most modern telephones .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #37:1>
The Phantom Phone has been designed to simulate this sound closely without need of an incoming signal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #38:1>
The circuit blocks required to achieve this are a main oscillator to provide the basic tone , a modulation oscillator to simulate the AC ringing waveform and the timing circuitry to mimic the well known double ring and pause of the standard UK ring signal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #39:1>
After the phone is picked up , S1b switches a low resistance across the circuit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #40:1>
Without this connection the ringer will fail to cut out crisply on switchoff .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #41:1>
The frequency of the main oscillator is not critical , so can vary to some extent without undue problems , but component tolerances may cause the timing to be incorrect with a resultant loss of realism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #42:1>
Two presets are provided to allow adjustments to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #43:1>
P1 sets the overall timing while P2 adjusts the pause between rings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #44:1>
The timing control is the main area which may require some explanation and reference to the timing diagram will simplify things .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #45:1>
The 4017BE is a sequential decade counter whose outputs switch high , in order , from Q0 to Q9 , Q0 being the reset condition whenever the reset input is at logic 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #46:1>
Since ten separate clock periods are represented by the counter , by ORing the outputs , any time period or combinations thereof can be obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #47:1>
In the circuit , four outputs have been diode ORed to realise two separate rings with the remaining six outputs left unconnected - creating a pause period between rings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #48:1>
One drawback of this system is that the time duration required is longer than can be obtained in just six clock periods .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #49:1>
When any output of the 4017 is connected to the clock inhibit input ( CE ) , the counter will latch when this output goes high .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #50:1>
To achieve an extension of the available pause time , one output has been linked to the clock inhibit input via an RC network which inhibits response to further clock pulses until the capacitor charge voltage at the inhibit input has decayed below the input threshold , around 2V .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #51:1>
D3 clips the negative spike at pin 13 , when the counter restarts .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #52:1>
At switch-on , a momentary high at the reset input , derived from R2-C2 , resets the timer to Q0 , ensuring silence until the switch-on hold-off time is complete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #53:1>
Commercial telephone ringers usually employ a piezo-electric device to create sound
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #54:1>
but in this application this proved somewhat feeble in both volume and resonant quality ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #55:1>
therefore the earpiece was tried instead with excellent results .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #56:1>
The impedance of the earpiece used in the prototype was rather more than 100 &Omega; , so the common emitter BC 327 is quite capable of handling the drive current and produces a respectably high volume with a truly authentic ringer sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #57:1>
When the circuit is energised by an on-hook condition , the clock will be disabled until the voltage across C1 rises to about 70% of the supply , approximately two minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #58:1>
The counter will then be clocked round , producing gating signals for the slow oscillator , ( IC1d ) , which in the turn gates the main oscillator , ( IC1c ) , via invertor , ( IC1a ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #59:1>
Tone bursts simulating a typical telephone ringer are then buffered by Q1 to drive the output transducer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #60:1>
When the instrument is picked up in response to the phantom caller , S1 will change over , instantly removing the supply and discharging the circuit to produce a crisp cut-off , as would be expected from a real telephone .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #61:1>
Replacing the phone will re-start the process from square one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #62:1>
Construction Details
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #63:1>
Several prototypes of the Phantom Phone were constructed with no appreciable problems being encountered &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #64:1>
a few points are worthy of note however .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #65:1>
The PCB was designed after considering the general dimensions of several different telephone housings ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #66:1>
so should present no difficulties , although it was found that mounting screwholes needed some adjustments to correctly align the hookswitch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #67:1>
Some degree of weakness , due to the odd shape of the board , necessitates the use of glass but not SRBP which is liable to crack at the base of the two tongues during filing etc .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #68:1>
The compact dimensions of this type of phone housing provides little headroom
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #69:1>
so components should be as small as possible , subminiature electrolytics and low profile IC sockets being ideal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #70:1>
When the phone is initially dismantled , some obstruction may be found in the rear moulding , used to hold the original piezo device but if this looks like causing a problem it can easily be trimmed out with sidecutters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #71:1>
The double pole hook switch should be retained for use in the new circuit , checking the mounting holes against the PCB layout .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #72:1>
When the PCB has been etched and trimmed , ensure that all mounting holes are in line and a PP3 battery slips easily between the two protrusions each side of the square cutout , as filing a completed board is awkward and may damage components .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #73:1>
Construction can now begin with the usual format of resistors first , although it can sometimes be an advantage to fit the IC sockets at an early stage to assist in the less obvious location of other components .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #74:1>
The last components to be fitted should be the hookswitch as this tends to make the board rather clumsy if fitted too early in construction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #75:1>
Some means of securing the battery clip leads should be included to avoid stress on the soldered ends or an eventual breakage may occur with subsequent failure of the equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #76:1>
On completion , the trackside should be thoroughly cleaned with a PCB cleaner to remove all flux deposits , paying particular attention to the area around the tantalum bead capacitor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #77:1>
Any leakage across the pads at this point could prevent the capacitor from charging with the result that the circuit will never start up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #78:1>
Testing
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #79:1>
Before commencing any tests it is a wise precaution to check the polarity of all electrolytics and diodes , small errors will always occur from time to time but need cause no undue problems if a simple check is made before power<l->up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #80:1>
The resistance can now be evaluated across the supply rails , this should be about 10RO , rising to a high value when the hookswitch is depressed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #81:1>
Assuming all is well , both presets should now be centred
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #82:1>
and one last check made to ensure both ICs are fitted the right way round before fitting the completed board into its housing and connecting the earpiece to facilitate further tests .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #83:1>
When testing any unknown circuit , it is desirable , although not entirely necessary , to supply power from a fully protected PSU as some types of battery can cause a problem should things go wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #84:1>
The most likely cause of failure in the Phanthom Phone circuit is with the switch-on delay .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #85:1>
The charging current for the tant is extremely small ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #86:1>
so any contamination on either side of the PCB , in the area of the tant , or even a rather leaky tant can prevent the clock enable threshold voltage from being reached .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #87:1>
This results in a circuit that can never start up .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #88:1>
Draining away vital current with a meter clipped across the tant is another cause of failure
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #89:1>
so should be avoided in preference for blind patience .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #90:1>
The prototype took about two minutes to begin its ringing sequence which is typical for the RC values used
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #91:1>
so it would be an error condition if this time is exceeded by more than around 50% .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #92:1>
Hopefully all will be well and the two presets can be carefully trimmed to produce the most authentic sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-032 #93:1>
All that now remains is to secure the PP3 battery in place and complete assembly of the unit . &black-square;

9 Practical aspects of installing a computer
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #2:1>
Keeping the computer happy &square;
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #3:1>
Keeping the user happy
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #4:1>
This chapter provides you with guidelines which will help you to ensure that your computer is installed and working in minimum time and with a minimum amount of fuss and annoying problems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #5:1>
Keeping the computer happy
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #6:1>
Temperature is one important factor that must be taken into consideration when deciding where the computer will be placed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #7:1>
Hot , sunny positions , nearby radiators or fan heaters can lead to the machine becoming overheated .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #8:1>
On the other hand , early winter mornings in offices where the heating is turned off overnight can lead to lubricants on components in disk drives and printers becoming too stiff to operate properly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #9:1>
Cold equipment is also more susceptible to condensation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #10:1>
Temperature
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #11:1>
Most electronic equipment works best at the temperature of a normal office , that is , around 20 &degree;C ( 70 &degree;F ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #12:1>
If it is comfortable for humans , then it will be OK for computers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #13:1>
Wide departures from this value will invariably lead to malfunction which can be either ( 1 ) insidious , hidden , with the system apparently working normally or ( 2 ) catastrophic with total hardware failure with , perhaps , disk drives not starting , components breaking down and sometimes even smoke !
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #14:1>
Failures that can be traced to excessively high or low temperatures might be beyond the scope of your maintenance contract and could result in a bill approaching half the original cost of the damaged equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #15:1>
Heat can build up inside the computer even though the room temperature is not excessive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #16:1>
Wherever the ventilation slots are located and however well the designers have protected the fan and provided for hot air to be expelled , with enough ingenuity it will always be possible for the inventive user to thwart the design , stifle the ventilation and get the machine to malfunction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #17:1>
Papers , clothing , furniture , etc. , can block the flow of air and even stop the fan from rotating .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #18:1>
Humidity
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #19:1>
Humidity , both very high and very low , can have serious consequences for the reliability of computers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #20:1>
Moisture will condense out of the air in a hot , muggy room onto the cold surfaces of a machine or box of floppy disks brought in from , say , the cold boot of a car in winter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #21:1>
Such moisture can cause havoc while it persists inside a computer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #22:1>
Under these conditions , switching on the computer before it has warmed up can lead to major problems because the moist air will be sucked into the works by the fan .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #23:1>
( An extreme example of such a situation occurred one cold January morning when a technician switched on the computer soon after the cleaner had washed the tiled floor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #24:1>
As the floor dried , the moisture-laden air was blown across the cold hard disk where it condensed causing a &lsquo; head-crash &rsquo; which cost &pound-sign;2,000 to repair .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #25:1>
It must be said , however , that moisture is unlikely to penetrate so easily to the surface of modern sealed Winchester type disks . )
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #26:1>
At the other extreme of very low humidity , which occurs in centrally heated offices in winter , there is the danger of a build-up of static electricity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #27:1>
Semi-conductor devices from which modern computers are constructed , are extremely vulnerable to high voltage discharges .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #28:1>
( In a particular office environment , people walked across a carpeted floor to collect their work as it was produced by the printer they all shared .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #29:1>
Three printers failed in one day before anyone realised that by simply walking across the carpet the users became charged with enough static to cause the trouble .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #30:1>
Anti-static sprays , anti-static carpeting , discharge mats and , most importantly , changes to working practices can all help to guard against such problems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #31:1>
Mains supply
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #32:1>
A poorly regulated or &lsquo; dirty &rsquo; mains supply can sometimes be the cause of equipmental malfunction which is often hard to trace .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #33:1>
Heavy lifts , welding equipment and industrial machinery can cause sudden changes in the mains voltage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #34:1>
If these changes are too great , and the power to the computer is taken from the same supply , then strange things can happen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #35:1>
Screen displays can be distorted , keyboards can become locked and data on disks can be corrupted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #36:1>
The act of switching on a microwave oven in another room has been known to stop a computer from working - much to the annoyance of a programmer who did not save his work often enough .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #37:1>
To find out the actual cause will often involve monitoring the situation over a period of time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #38:1>
It is best to keep a log of such problems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #39:1>
Just a note in the diary showing the time , what job the computer was doing , what went wrong and any external conditions that changed at about the same time ( e.g. someone plugged in a kettle ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #40:1>
So if you find that your system &lsquo; locks up &rsquo; or &lsquo; goes down &rsquo; for inexplicable reasons , there is a chance that the mains supply is to blame , particularly if you share a building with other companies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #41:1>
One way of overcoming problems with the mains supply is to install a regulator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #42:1>
However , they are expensive , but if you have chosen your suppliers well , you may find that they are willing to loan or rent you one for a short period so that you can find out whether or not you really need one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #43:1>
If you are sure that the problem is being brought into your premises because you share the electricity supply then you can get the electricity company to install a &lsquo; clean line &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #44:1>
This requires a separate cable from the point where their cable enters the building to your meter , so you will have to convince them that it is really necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #45:1>
They may need to install a recording device to monitor the voltage for two or three weeks to verify the need .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #46:1>
Abuse
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #47:1>
The technology of hard disk systems requires that the disk be spinning at about 3,000 revolutions per minute and that the recording heads , which are mounted on long arms , be thrust back and forwards over the disk surface whilst remaining very close to it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #48:1>
Any serious knock can cause the arms to vibrate .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #49:1>
If the vibration is too great , then the recording heads can come into contact with the surface of the disk and , because the disk is spinning so fast , the magnetic material will be ploughed off and the disk will be damaged .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #50:1>
Rapid movement of the computer cabinet can cause gyroscopic effects that distort the disk itself with similar consequences .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #51:1>
However , one should not get too alarmed about these dangers because these movements and knocks would have to be pretty severe for problems to occur .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #52:1>
Nevertheless , a busy London firm of solicitors found themselves without their file server for several days because staff did not respect the system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #53:1>
The file server was placed beside the desk of a VDU operator who used to place her feet on it when she turned around to chat with her colleague .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #54:1>
As she turned back and forth , the cabinet would tilt and knock against the wall .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #55:1>
The poor machine stood up to it for several months , but the day came when it got a harder knock than usual and the result was a &pound-sign;1,500 bi bill bill for a new disk .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #56:1>
Coffee , tea , soft drinks , confectionery , sandwiches , fruit and other food and drink do not mix well with computing equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #57:1>
The most vulnerable items are the keyboard , floppy disks and printers because these are the items that people handle , but it is not unknown for monitors and machines to suffer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #58:1>
The only way to ensure that these problems never occur is to insist that food and drink are kept away from the equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #59:1>
However , in a small office this can be difficult to enforce .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #60:1>
If it is possible to provide a table and a couple of chairs specifically for the staff to use during their coffee breaks , then the risks can be kept within bounds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #61:1>
Keeping the user happy
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #62:1>
Working with a computer can be extremely demanding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #63:1>
A skilled word processor operator does not have to look at the screen while typing , but what has been entered must be proof-read and this requires concentration to ensure that it is done properly .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #64:1>
A greater level of concentration is required to ensure accurate entry of accounting or other critical numerical data .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #65:1>
Most people find they get tired after looking at a computer screen for an hour or so .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #66:1>
There are many things that can influence the effectiveness of an operator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #67:1>
Most have been well documented and guidelines have been drawn up by such bodies as the EEC Commission and by trades unions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #68:1>
These guidelines are based on the fact that jobs that entail the concentrated use of VDU screens and keyboards leave little scope for exercise of any kind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #69:1>
Posture
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #70:1>
Prolonged inactivity in any position will eventually lead to discomfort .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #71:1>
Poorly designed chairs , badly placed screens and awkward keyboards can quickly lead to long term aches and pains , so it is worthwhile considering the comfort of the operator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #72:1>
Adjustable chairs or stools which incorporate footrests and proper back support will go a long way to help .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #73:1>
There should be adequate space on desks to accommodate both keyboards and screens .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #74:1>
In particular , the depth of the desks should be sufficient to allow the screens to be placed at viewing distances that the operators find comfortable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #75:1>
Height of the screen is another important factor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #76:1>
The common practice of placing screens on top of computer cabinets often leaves them too high , especially for anyone who wears bifocals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #77:1>
The need to look upwards , in turn , encourages users to slouch down in their chairs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #78:1>
Proper height , slope and overall design of keyboards can help reduce fatigue and thereby cut down keying errors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #79:1>
Most people find that being able to rest forearms on the desk or chair arms is helpful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #80:1>
Again , sufficient depth to desks is important .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #81:1>
The more demanding the work the sooner fatigue sets in .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #82:1>
It is therefore necessary to encourage the operators to take short breaks to keep them properly alert .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #83:1>
One way of ensuring that this happens is to build in time away from the workstation as part of the job . .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #84:1>
For instance , accounting and stock control work can be collected into batches to be filed by the operator immediately after having been entered into the computer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #85:1>
Schemes of this type can also be of significant value when tracing dubious entries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #86:1>
There is considerable variation in personal preference , and so the more flexibility that is built into the arrangements from the start , the easier it will be to accommodate people with different tastes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #87:1>
Setting up the screen
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #88:1>
There are external factors that can affect the performance of the operator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #89:1>
One of the most pernicious is reflections of bright lights and objects on the screen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #90:1>
These can simply be annoying or they can actually affect the readability of the display .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #91:1>
It is usually impossible to eliminate reflections altogether , but it is necessary to place the screens , shade lights , adjust curtains , etc. , to cut them to a minimum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #92:1>
There are screens or attachments available which can help in stubborn cases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #93:1>
An often neglected factor is the background behind the screen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #94:1>
Probably the worst thing that one can have is a large , south facing window glazed with reeded glass which can disperse the sun 's rays in all directions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #95:1>
Poorly shaded lights or a lot of movement are also undesirable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #96:1>
The best would be a background of about the same brightness as the average over the screen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #97:1>
The controls on VDUs are often wildly out of adjustment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #98:1>
Very often the screens are run at too high a brightness level which can quickly tire the eyes and wear out the screen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #99:1>
VDU brightness should be adjusted according to the ambient lighting conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #100:1>
Operators should be taught what effect each of the knobs on the VDU has on the display and should be encouraged to set them to their own preference .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #101:1>
The fact is that many operators just accept the displays as they are installed , but by encouraging them to think about the appearance of the display and showing them how to make adjustments , management can help to make their employees more comfortable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #102:1>
Occasional cleaning with anti-static cleaner can also help .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #103:1>
Displays should be carefully examined when they are first set up after delivery and any that exhibit permanent flicker or movement should be rejected during installation and should be replaced or repaired as quickly as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-033 #104:1>
Particular attention should be paid to the top and left-hand side where many activities start .

The History Of Television
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #2:1>
Only 55 years ago , the idea of films and news being shown in every house in the country would have seemed pure fantasy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #3:1>
Ian Poole tells of how it became fact .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #4:1>
Television is accepted as part of everyday life and most people have at least one set in the house .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #5:1>
Many of the programs we see are also becoming part of family life .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #6:1>
Neighbours , The Bill and many others are all very popular and are watched by millions of people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #7:1>
However , it is only just over fifty years since the first television programs were broadcast .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #8:1>
Television technology has progressed rapidly since this time and few people would have predicted the popularity which it now enjoys .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #9:1>
In The Beginning
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #10:1>
Shortly after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone people started to wonder if it was possible to send pictures over wires .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #11:1>
Soon science fiction authors started to write stories which included the potential uses for this proposed invention .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #12:1>
However , it was too early to make any real developments even though the first step had already been taken .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #13:1>
The first breakthrough was the discovery that light falling on the chemical element selenium made its resistance change .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #14:1>
This allowed light to control the amount of current flowing in a circuit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #15:1>
The next major step occurred just before the turn of the century , when in 1897 a German scientist named Braun developed the basic cathode ray tube ( CRT ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #16:1>
Braun 's CRT was taken further by a Russian named Rosing who in 1907 managed to display the crude outline of a number of shapes , although the means of generating the signals to feed to the tube was purely mechanical .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #17:1>
Following on from the invention of the CRT , an Englishman named A A Campbell Swinton suggested that it could be used as a television receiver with a similar device used as a transmitter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #18:1>
He freely admitted that the technology did not exist to implement his ideas ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #19:1>
however , they formed the basis of the electronic systems which were to follow many years later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #20:1>
In 1920 a Russian emigre named Zworykin working in America started to develop a photoelectric TV camera tube .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #21:1>
He progressed quite rapidly and by 1932 had developed the idea sufficiently to take out a patent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #22:1>
However , it took him until 1928 to produce a working item which he called an iconoscope .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #23:1>
This development was vital and paved the way for the all electronic television system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #24:1>
TV Comes To Life
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #25:1>
Whilst the development of the iconoscope was taking place in America a Scot named John Logie Baird was making tremendous progress towards a mechanical television system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #26:1>
Although the system was very crude by today 's standards Baird managed to produce his first TV picture in October 1925 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #27:1>
It was of an office boy who could just be recognised on the small screen of the receiver .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #28:1>
Definition was poor because the system only had eight lines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #29:1>
However , this was soon increased to 30 lines with Baird making the best use of any publicity he could get , often reaching the news headlines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #30:1>
Baird was also working towards a transmitter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #31:1>
February 1928 saw this accomplished with a test transmission that was reported on the front pages of a number of newspapers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #32:1>
Later he even made some transatlantic transmissions which were also widely reported .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #33:1>
Despite his initial success Baird found it difficult to gain any cooperation from the BBC , who held the monopoly on broadcasting at the time , however with Baird 's skilful manipulation of the media , the BBC eventually agreed to make some test transmissions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #34:1>
On 30th September 1929 transmissions started on the medium wave .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #35:1>
Unlike today 's television signals , which have to be transmitted in the UHF portion of the spectrum because of the large amount of bandwidth required , these early transmissions could be accommodated on a medium wave transmitter because they only consisted of 30 lines with a frame being repeated at twelve and a half times a second .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #36:1>
These transmissions did not represent any milestone in terms of technical development but they did achieve their aim of winning a lot of publicity , even if they were only watched by a few people .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #37:1>
With the advent of TV transissions , other companies started to develop their own systems .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #38:1>
The most notable was EMI who soon had an all electronic scanning system running .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #39:1>
The camera tube was called an Emitron and was similar to the iconoscope developed by Zworykin -
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #40:1>
the receiver used a CRT .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #41:1>
As development progressed EMI quickly realised that the definition of the system could be increased .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #42:1>
This means that higher bandwidths would be needed and they did not have the expertise to design transmitters .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #43:1>
As a result the Marconi company , which had a wealth of experience in transmitter design , was invited to join tthe the venture .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #44:1>
A government inquiry was set up in 1934 to look into the future of television broadcasting and decided that a service should be set up and run by the BBC .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #45:1>
It also recommended that the service should have at least 240 lines , which happened to be the limit for the Baird system at the time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #46:1>
TV Cameras
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #47:1>
The early TV cameras were based on the Nipkow disc which consisted of a rotating wheel with a spiral of holes on it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #48:1>
As the disc turned , the image would be scanned as a series of rows and the strength of the light coming through the holes sensed with a photo-detector and turned into an electrical signal to be viewed with a TV monitor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #49:1>
Most modern professional television cameras rely on vacuum tubes on one end of which is a photosensitive surface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #50:1>
The picture is focussed on this and charges are stored up in relation to the amount of brightenss brightness of the various portions of the image .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #51:1>
A scanning beam then discharges the target in a predetermined sequence to produce an analogue voltage which can be transmitted to TV sets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #52:1>
The two competing systems for the BBC 's service were from Baird and Marconi-EMI which was an all electronic system with 405 lines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #53:1>
To decide between them , both systems were used for a trial period on alternate weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #54:1>
Transmissions started on 2nd November 1936 from Alexandra Palace in North London and constituted the world 's first regular high definition TV channel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #55:1>
The tests conclusively proved that the Baird mechanical system could not compete with an all electronic system and after only three months it was abandoned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #56:1>
At this stage TV developed quite slowly and by mid 1939 only 18,000 sets had been sold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #57:1>
One reason for this was that they were expensive , costing about the same as a new car at around &pound-sign;100 each .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #58:1>
In 1939 the Second World War broke out and , for fear that enemy bombers would use the transmitters for guidance , the service was closed down .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #59:1>
However the transmitters were activated a few times during the next few years to jam German navigational signals which happened to use the old television frequencies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #60:1>
Despite the fact that British television transmissions had stopped , other countries opened their own services .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #61:1>
America launched its first in 1941 and in 1942 the Nazis started a service in Paris .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #62:1>
However the war served to advance television technology because CRTs were also used for radar and a lot of effort was invested in improving them .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #63:1>
After the War
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #64:1>
At the end of the War , television transmissions were not resumed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #65:1>
In 1945 a committee was set up to review how the service should restart .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #66:1>
It decided that the BBC should continue along the same lines as it had before the War and less than a year later on 7th June 1946 , television transmissions recommenced .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #67:1>
Initially there were only a few viewers because the only sets in existence were those from before the War .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #68:1>
Fortunately demand for sets soon started to increase as the country started to recover from the war .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #69:1>
People also began to realise the importance of TV as a medium for entertainment and news coverage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #70:1>
This was demonstrated particularly well in 1953 when t,ART(indef) {A huge outside broadcast operation was mounted showing every part of the event and it was an enormous success .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #71:1>
More than 20 million people tuned in and , apart from the mass appeal , it was a tremendous technical achievement since no event had been given this level of coverage before .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #72:1>
The Coming Of Ads
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #73:1>
With the success of the televising of the coronation more people started to buy television sets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #74:1>
In turn this started to increase pressure on the government to provide a second channel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #75:1>
Ideas of having a commercial channel funded by advertising created concerns about standards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #76:1>
Many people doubted whether it would ever be viable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #77:1>
The debate was ended on 22nd September 1955 when Independent Television was launched .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #78:1>
At first the viewing figures were fairly low .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #79:1>
The main reason was that the BBC broadcast on a frequency band between 41 and 68MHz , whereas ITV was allocated those between 174 and 216MHz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #80:1>
To overcome the fact that existing television could not receive the new channel , converter units were sold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #81:1>
These consisted of an amplifier and mixer to convert the ITV signal down to a frequency which could be received by existing sets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #82:1>
However , new sets soon appeared that were able to receive all the TV channels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #83:1>
In addition to the new channel other improvements were being made .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #84:1>
Many of these gave better service with fewer breakdowns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #85:1>
Others allowed the programme producers more flexibility .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #86:1>
One notable milestone occurred after the satellite Telstar was launched .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #87:1>
On 11th July 1962 television engineers managed to transmit live television signals across the Atlantic .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #88:1>
These pictures were watched by millions and represented a huge achievement for the engineers involved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #89:1>
Bigger And Better
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #90:1>
Whilst the 405 line high definition standard was adequate for television of the 1940s and 1950s , it soon became apparent that higher quality was needed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #91:1>
America had gone for 525 lines which gave a noticeable improvement over the British television transmissions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #92:1>
In order to meet the growing demand for better definition the BBC launched a new service in the UHF part of the spectrum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #93:1>
BBC 2 was opened on 20th April 1964 and was initially broadcast from the Crystal Palace transmitter , although the service was soon extended to other sites .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #94:1>
BBC 1 and ITV were also transferred to UHF about two years later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #95:1>
Colour TV In 1928
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #96:1>
The new high definition service offered more than just a better black and white picture .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #97:1>
It was envisaged from the outset that it would be possible to use it for colour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #98:1>
On 1st July 1967 the BBC launched Europe 's first regular colour service representing the culmination of many years of work beginning in the earliest days of television .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #99:1>
It is surprising to note that colour television had been demonstrated by Baird in 1928 using his mechanical television system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #100:1>
He did this by synchronously rotating blue green and red filters in front of the camera and receiver .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #101:1>
However it was not easy to use and it required many more pictures to be transmitted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #102:1>
With the demise of his mechanical system , Baird still pursued his investigations into television .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #103:1>
He devised a colour system for the electronic system using two images with filters to combine them optically .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #104:1>
RCA ( Radio Corporation of America ) devised a similar system using three filters to give full colour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #105:1>
Unfortunately , both of these schemes had severe limitations and neither came to fruition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #106:1>
Real progress was made when RCA invented the shadowmask CRT .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #107:1>
It was first demonstrated in 1950 but was very expensive to make and the idea of colour lay dormant for several years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #108:1>
In 1953 the American National Television Standards Committee ( NTSC , also known as Never Twice the Same Colour ) adopted a system for colour transmissions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #109:1>
It was based on the fact that a colour picture contains both luminance ( light or brightness ) and the colour .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #110:1>
These two signals were encoded separately before transmission and had the advantage that monochrome receivers could still be used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #111:1>
However , it did have some disadvantages , the main one being that slight changes in the phase of the signal gave rise to colour changes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #112:1>
Further work was carried out in Europe to improve the system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #113:1>
The French came up with the SECAM system which was adopted in France , the USSR and Eastern Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #114:1>
In Germany Telefunken devised PAL which was adopted in the rest of Western Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #115:1>
Sky 's The Limit
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #116:1>
Television technology is still advancing and the idea of direct broadcasting from a satellite is an indication of this .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #117:1>
In addition there are the new picture transmission standards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #118:1>
The Independent Broadcasting Authority has put forward a new system named MAC ( Multiplexed Analogue Components ) and the Japanese are trying to establish a new 1125 lines , 30 frames per second , high definition standard ( HDTV ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-034 #119:1>
The battles for supremacy of these systems are still being fought and only time will tell which system will be accepted . &black-square;

<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #12:1>
FIRST PRINCIPLES
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #13:1>
The first vehicle capable of reaching space - the V-2 ballistic missile ( see right ) - demonstrates the essential simplicity of the principles behind the design of a rocket-propelled spacecraft .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #14:1>
The V-2 's body was long and streamlined to reduce drag at supersonic speeds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #15:1>
At the top was the warhead &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #16:1>
beneath it , taking up most of the internal volume , were the tanks holding the propellants .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #17:1>
Both - fuel and oxidant - were pumped into the rocket motor , where they burned together to produce hot gas at high pressure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #18:1>
The high pressure forced the gas to accelerate through the nozzle and leave the motor at high speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #19:1>
This is the principle on which rockets work :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #20:1>
the reaction to the acceleration of gas exhaust produces the thrust .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #21:1>
You can try a simple experiment on reaction by sitting in a chair with castors - an office chair or a wheelchair - and throwing a heavy object , such as a brick or a book , away from you .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #22:1>
The force on your arm as you accelerate the book reacts through your body to the chair , which will accelerate in the opposite direction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #23:1>
The thrust is simply the mass of the book ( or hot gas ) thrown within a given period of time , multiplied by the velocity at which the book ( or gas ) is thrown .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #24:1>
The V-2 's thrust ( 56,000 pounds / 25,000 kilo<l>grams ) was greater than its weight ( 28,000 pounds or 13,000 ) , so the vehicle accelerated upwards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #25:1>
After 70 seconds all the propellant had been burned and the V-2 was moving at 3,500 miles per hour ( 5,600 kilometres per hour ) , or about one-fifth of satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #26:1>
Before burn-out the missile turned over to a pre-selected angle from the vertical , depending on the required distance to the point of impact .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #27:1>
It was now unpowered and in very thin air , and followed more or less the trajectory of a large stone thrown at the same height and speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #28:1>
It then re-entered the thicker layers of the atmos<l>phere and fell to the target detonation area .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #29:1>
SPEEDING INTO ORBIT
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #30:1>
The V-2 was a big step towards a spaceliner :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #31:1>
it could reach space .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #32:1>
At an altitude of 60 miles ( 96 kilometres ) - the maximum height the V-2 reached - the air has about one-millionth the density at sea level , so the V-2 can be consi<l>dered to have been in space for a brief period .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #33:1>
But there was still a major breakthrough to be made : reaching orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #34:1>
The main obstacle to this was the amount of fuel required .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #35:1>
Propellant took up 75 per cent of the V-2 's take-off weight , enabling it to achieve a max<l>imum speed of 3,500 miles per hour ( 5,600 kilometres per hour ) , only one-fifth of the veloc<l>ity needed to go into orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #36:1>
Most of the work from the engine was used to accelerate the V-2 to high speed ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #37:1>
some was needed to overcome the drag of the atmosphere , and some to support the weight of the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #38:1>
In free space , away from drag and gravity , a V-2 would reach a speed of 6,300 miles per hour ( 10,000 kilometres per hour ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #39:1>
But to reach orbit an object must accelerate to a speed of about 17,500 miles per hour ( 28,000 kilometres per hour , called satellite speed or orbital velocity ) in a horizontal direction &semi; and it must reach an altitude of more than 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) , in order to be clear of the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #40:1>
It is far easier to launch a spacecraft to reach satellite height than satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #41:1>
If you threw a ball upwards from the ground at 4,000 miles per hour ( 6,400 kilometres per hour ) and there were no air resistance , it would reach a maximum height of 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) before falling back to Earth about six minutes later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #42:1>
This is less than a quarter of the speed needed to sustain a satellite in orbit , and it requires less than one-sixteenth of the energy ( which is proportional to the speed squared ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #43:1>
In order to reach orbit a V-2 would have to be filled with propellant up to as much as 98 per cent of its take-off weight , leaving only 2 per cent for everything else .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #44:1>
Clearly , this is not practical .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #45:1>
A propellant weight of around 85 per cent is a practical upper limit for a space vehicle consist<l>ing of just a propellant tank , a rocket engine and payload .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #46:1>
With V-2 engines such a vehicle would have a maximum speed of only about 6,000 miles per hour ( 9,600 kilometres per hour ) or about one-third of satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #47:1>
One way of reducing the amount of fuel required would be to use jet engines instead of rockets .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #48:1>
Jets take in oxygen from the air , whereas rockets have to carry their own .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #49:1>
Thus at low speeds jet engines produce 10 to 20 times more thrust than a rocket for the same fuel consumption .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #50:1>
Unfortunately , at the time the first launchers were required , jets could operate only up to about one-tenth satellite speed , so they could not be used to solve the problem .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #51:1>
Even now jets can only operate up to about one-sixth satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #52:1>
Aerodynamic heating and the difficulties of achieving stable combus<l>tion in a very fast air flow are among the problems remaining to be solved before jet engines can be made to operate at higher speeds .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #53:1>
They are , of course , limited to altitudes at which there is an adeguate adequate supply of air , and cannot operate in space .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #54:1>
ONE STAGE MORE
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #55:1>
To build a vehicle that could achieve the speed required to put a satellite in orbit it therefore became necessary to build a series of vehicles mounted on top of each other .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #56:1>
Each stage of , for example , a four-stage vehicle will add about one-quarter of satellite speed to the velocity that has been achieved by the preceding stages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #57:1>
The payload ( the satellite being transported ) which is carried by the fourth stage and finally reaches orbit , is very light .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #58:1>
The first satellite launched by the USA weighed just 18 pounds ( 8 kilograms ) :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #59:1>
it was carried by the fourth stage of its Juno launch vehicle and weighed one four-thousandth of the vehicle 's total weight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #60:1>
The ratio of the weight of the fuel carried to the weight of the aircraft and its payload is known as the fuel fraction ( see opposite ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #61:1>
In the Juno and other launchers it amounted to typically 85 per cent on each stage , which allowed no weight to spare for devices such as wings , landing-gear , a cockpit or a pilot , which would have made recovery possible after the fight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #62:1>
This was one reason why early satellite launch vehicles could be used only once and were then abandoned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #63:1>
Another was that their design was based on ballistic missiles , which were expend<l>able by nature of their task .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #64:1>
All this explains why early satellite launch vehicles were used for only one mission &semi; why they consisted of multiple stages &semi; and why they could carry only a very small payload .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #65:1>
Modern launch vehicles have more efficient engines and can launch a heavier payload : typically as much as two per cent of their launch weight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #66:1>
However , some aspects of their design have not evolved substantially :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #67:1>
they still consist of multiple stages and they are expendable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #68:1>
These are major reasons why the cost of space transportation has remained extremely high .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #69:1>
DESIGNING A SPACELINER
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #70:1>
It would have been very difficult in 1904 to predict what the first airliners would be like .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #71:1>
But this time around there are differences which can make it far easier to plan early spaceliners .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #72:1>
First , the basic engineering requirement is fixed :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #73:1>
to design an aeroplane which will accelerate to satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #74:1>
There were no such fixed requirements for early aircraft .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #75:1>
Second , we know quite accurately the performance of the engines we will have to use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #76:1>
In the foreseeable future there is no substitute for rocket motors using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen prop<l>ellants at least for the high-speed part of the flight to orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #77:1>
Pioneering aeroplane designers were faced with a bewildering choice of en<l>gines and propellers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #78:1>
Running ( operating ) costs , scarcely a consid<l>eration for the pioneer aircraft designers , will be a crucial factor in the design of early spacelin<l>ers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #79:1>
Our review of the market in Chapter 1 shows that spaceliners would be used initially for ferrying staff and cargo to and from government-funded space stations &semi; and then for space tourism .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #80:1>
The breakthrough to operations approaching the scale of air travel will occur during the exclusive phase of space tourism development , when middle-income people can afford a trip to space after saving for a few years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #81:1>
This requires a price of around $10,000 ( &pound-sign;6,000 ) per trip .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #82:1>
To allow for indirect costs and profits , the direct operating costs ( depreciation , crew , fuel and maintenance ) of the spaceliner will have to be around half the fare at $5,000 ( &pound-sign;3,000 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #83:1>
CONCORDE LOOKALIKE
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #84:1>
From the various requirements considered above we can predict that a plane designed to fly passengers into space and back will be a high-speed airliner looking , superficially , much like Concorde .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #85:1>
It will be able to take off from an ordinary runway &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #86:1>
to get into space it will fly faster and higher until it reaches orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #87:1>
Because it will be flying at supersonic speeds a spacelin<l>er , like a supersonic airliner , will be stream<l>lined .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #88:1>
It will be propelled through the early phase of the flight by jet engines &semi; and acceler<l>ated into orbit by rocket engines , which will be fuelled by liquid hydrogen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #89:1>
This takes up to ten times the volume of the same weight of aviation fuel and it must be kept below its boiling point of - 253 &degree;C , or only 20 &degree; above absolute zero .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #90:1>
A spaceliner will also need a robust , durable and practical structure , containing accommodation for passengers , crew , baggage and some cargo .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #91:1>
In order to be certified to carry passengers , a spaceliner will have to pass full civil airliner standards of airworthiness .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #92:1>
Various adjustments will have to be made to allow for flying into orbit -
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #93:1>
for instance , a spaceliner must not only protect the passengers from the intense cold of the upper atmosphere and outer space but also from the intense heat of re-entry into the atmosphere , typically over 1,000 &degree;C ( 2,440 &degree;F ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #94:1>
Certification standards for civil airliners are must much higher than those accepted for manned spaceflight .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #95:1>
A spaceliner designed according to the requirements outlined above will be a reusable , single-stage aeroplane , able to take off horizon<l>tally and using jet engines for the early part of the ascent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #96:1>
Many of the technical problems posed have been resolved , but some major develop<l>ments must still be made , so such a vehicle must remain a long-term ideal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #97:1>
The first spaceliner to fly passengers into orbit will be a compromise between this ideal and what can be achieved using existing technology .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #98:1>
NEW TECHNOLOGY
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #99:1>
A single-stage reusable spaceliner with a robust structure presents the designer with a problem :
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #100:1>
it must accommodate enough fuel to reach orbit in one stage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #101:1>
Using the most efficient rocket engines currently available - those fuelled by hydrogen - no less than 87 per cent of the take-off weight of a spaceliner would be taken up by the amount of propellant ( hydrogen fuel plus oxidant ) that would have to be carried , leaving only 13 per cent for structure , engines , landing<l->gear , furnishings , crew , passengers and bag<l>gage .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #102:1>
This ratio of weight of fuel carried to the weight of the spacecraft and its payload is known as the fuel fraction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #103:1>
A fuel fraction as high as 87 per cent of take-off weight is clearly not practical when you consider that today 's long-range airliners can take off with nearly 5O per cent of their weight as fuel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #104:1>
The record fuel fraction for an aeroplane is 72 per cent , achieved by the Rutan Voyager ( see page 37 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #105:1>
The Voyager took off under its own power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #106:1>
An air-launched version , like the X-15 shown on page 18 , could have carried more fuel and have achieved a fuel fraction of about 80 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #107:1>
It is therefore unlikely that in the plannable future a single-stage spaceliner could achieve a fuel fraction much over 70 per cent , or that an air-launched ( two-stage ) spaceliner much more than 80 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #108:1>
One practical solution to reduce the amount of fuel required would be to use jet engines for the early part of the ascent , and modern rocket engines from thereon into orbit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #109:1>
At present jets can only operate up to about one-sixth satellite speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-035 #110:1>
This would reduce the fuel required to about 80 per cent , which is still too high for a practical single-stage spaceliner .

<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #1:1>
From little acorns ...
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #2:1>
Ken Morse looks back over the last seven years to see how Presentation Manager has evolved in the IBM marketplace .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #3:1>
He also considers the benefits of the new graphics standard , XGA .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #4:1>
The user environment of Presentation Manager is not new ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #5:1>
much of the pioneering work was carried out in the late 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre ( PARC ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #6:1>
Apple was the first company to bring a fully integrated system to the marketplace in 1983 with the launch of the Macintosh and many companies have followed suit , including Atari , Commodore and Microsoft .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #7:1>
Microsoft 's offering , called Windows , was originally announced in November 1983 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #8:1>
Two years later , in November 1985 , it was released to the public .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #9:1>
In comparison with the Macintosh interface it was crude &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #10:1>
windows on screen could not be overlapped , effectively removing the advantage of displaying several windows on the desktop as there wasn't room .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #11:1>
One reason for this was the highly motivated group of lawyers employed by Apple who took issue with anyone who provided a user interface similar to the Macintosh offering .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #12:1>
Third party developers were reluctant to release applications for Windows , complaining that it was slow .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #13:1>
This was certainly true running on the 6MHz ATs of the day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #14:1>
Undeterred , Microsoft continued refining Windows and in November 1987 ( I guess Microsoft likes November launches ! ) Windows 2.0 was released .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #15:1>
This had a vastly improved user interface , including overlapped windows and better menu and dialog box support .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #16:1>
The improvement was so great that Apple 's lawyers were pushed into action and fortunately , for the rest of us , the lawsuit was settled .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #17:1>
By this time PC compatible machines were starting to run VGA , with fast 286s and 386s giving rise to yet more system performance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #18:1>
With the release of Windows 2.0 the built-in functions were greatly extended .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #19:1>
This aided software developers in the task of implementing menus , dialog boxes , scroll bars and other components of a user-friendly interface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #20:1>
Now , at last , applications started to appear and the Windows movement gained momentum .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #21:1>
The initial release of OS/2 1.0 was known as the multi-tasking kernel and it was not until the release of OS/2 1.1 in - wait for it - November 1988 that Presentation Manager ( PM ) appeared .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #22:1>
In OS/2 1.1 one session runs in a graphics mode and is devoted to PM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #23:1>
All PM applications ( as well as a Task Manager and Start Programs window , which are part of the PM shell ) run in this session .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #24:1>
The addition of PM to OS/2 requires little in the way of changes to the OS/2 kernel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #25:1>
Instead , the PM is basically a collection of dynamic link libraries ( . DLL files ) that extend the functionality of OS/2 to include window management and graphics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #26:1>
Although the PM session is primarily for its programs , many programs written for the OS/2 kernel can also run in &lsquo; text windows &rsquo; in this session .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #27:1>
However , these programs can't use graphics or take advantage of menus , dialog boxes and other aspects of the user interface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #28:1>
OS/2 kernel programs that write directly to the video display or that install video , keyboard , or mouse enhancements cannot run under PM and must run in their own session .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #29:1>
For the program developer , PM has an extensive Application Program Interface ( API ) which includes many high-level functions for creating windows and managing the user interface .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #30:1>
This API is largely derived from Microsoft Windows &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #31:1>
although the two systems aren't exactly the same , they have many structural and conceptual similarities .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #32:1>
The OS/2 PM also includes the Graphics Programming Interface ( GPI ) , a sophisticated graphics system adapted from IBM 's Graphics Data Display Manager ( GDDM ) and the 3270 Graphics Control Program ( GCP ) &semi; with some elements inherited from the Windows Graphics Device Interface ( GDI ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #33:1>
PM programs designed for the OS/2 environment can also take advantage of preemptive , priority-based multi-tasking , 16Mb of physical memory , virtual memory management , and interprocess communication ( discussed last month ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #34:1>
Conformity and device independence
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #35:1>
A traditional program receives user input from the keyboard and displays output to the screen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #36:1>
But with the addition of a mouse , the screen itself becomes a potential source of input .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #37:1>
Logic within PM assists the application in obtaining user input from various controls on the screen , such as menus , scroll bars , buttons and dialog boxes .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #38:1>
The interaction between the mouse and the screen narrows the gap between user and program .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #39:1>
The menu and dialog box interface is built into PM rather than into each individual application , so the interface is consistent across applications , enabling a user with experience of one PM to easily learn another .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #40:1>
Fortunately , this doesn't lead to each program looking like every other since the most important interaction takes place within the window , the organisation of which is open to the creativity of the application programmer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #41:1>
The IBM PC was designed around the principle of open architecture .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #42:1>
Third-party manufacturers have responded to this fact by developing many different , and often incompatible , output devices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #43:1>
Under MSDOS , program developers have faced the problem of writing their own device drivers for CGA , Hercules , EGA , VGA , as well as for a number of high resolution video adaptors such as Super VGA .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #44:1>
The problem of printers is even worse -
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #45:1>
some MSDOS programs come with a disk full of printer drivers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #46:1>
With PM this mess is brushed aside .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #47:1>
The Graphics Programming Interface of PM is device independent -
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #48:1>
an application need not identify the output device in order to use it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #49:1>
lf a PM driver exists for the output device , then all PM programs can use the device .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #50:1>
This also helps to protect programs from obsolescence .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #51:1>
For example , the video display technology is changing daily , but PM programs written today will run unchanged on future video adaptors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #52:1>
Programmers have a choice of developing applications for either the OS/2 kernel or the OS/2 PM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #53:1>
Each environment has distinct advantages and disadvantages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #54:1>
For some applications the OS/2 kernel is obviously preferable , for example conversions of current character based MSDOS programs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #55:1>
PM programmers have inherited the mistaken belief ( from Windows ) that they are more difficult to write and debug than &lsquo; normal &rsquo; programs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #56:1>
Windows/PM programs are user-driven rather than program-driven , adopting the tag &lsquo; inside-out programming &rsquo; along the way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #57:1>
It is the user who decides what operation to carry out by using the mouse or the keyboard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #58:1>
When this is done an event is generated and passed to the application .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #59:1>
In general most applications consist of a short loop which detects events and passes control to the relevant handler for that event .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #60:1>
I freely admit that given the choice I would write applications requiring user input under Windows/PM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #61:1>
SAA
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #62:1>
Apart from their important role in OS/2 , the PM user interface and API are also part of IBM 's System Application Architecture ( SAA ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #63:1>
SAA attempts to correct a historical weakness in IBM 's line of computers and operating systems by setting user interface and API standards .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #64:1>
If the goals of SAA come to pass , then the PM user interface will become a common sight on IBM minicomputer and mainframe terminals .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #65:1>
Just as important for the program developer , it may be possible to write a PM program in a high-level language and compile it to run on a variety of computers from the IBM AT to the IBM 370 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #66:1>
Death bell or saviour ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #67:1>
Windows 3.0 , death bell or saviour for OS/2 ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #68:1>
There are many people around arguing for both sides .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #69:1>
Personally , I side with the latter view .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #70:1>
The introduction of Windows 3.0 has generated a huge interest in graphical user interfaces .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #71:1>
People are at last realising that they don't have to be tied down to the character-based spreadsheets and word processors they 've been using for the last few years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #72:1>
With hardware readily and cheaply available that can deliver the performance required by Windows , people are starting to make the transition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #73:1>
Third-party software developers are seizing the chance to make their products the de-facto standard within a Windows environment , hence the large number of applications available at the Windows 3.0 launch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #74:1>
What does this mean for OS/2 ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #75:1>
Microsoft has stated that it intends to make Windows 3.0 and PM applications binary compatible , making it possible for Windows 3.0 applications to run under PM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #76:1>
This provides an instant accessible software base for PM , in addition to the native PM applications that exist today such as PageMaker and Excel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #77:1>
Applications which are written specifically for OS/2 and PM can use the features described last month , such as multiple threads and interprocess communications , to provide new high-powered applications that users will be demanding in the next five years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #78:1>
Hence , I think the future for OS/2 , thanks to Windows 3.0 , is looking good .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #79:1>
Of course , I 'm not saying that you have to switch to OS/2 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #80:1>
If you 're happy with your application running on your setup , why change ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #81:1>
It 's just that once creative , native OS/2 PM applications appear you may find yourself unhappy with the Windows application you have !
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #82:1>
OS/2 &lsquo; Lite &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #83:1>
One often raised question about OS/2 is &lsquo; Why does it require so much memory ? &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #84:1>
OS/2 1.2 standard edition needs at least 2.5Mb of system memory to run .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #85:1>
And if you use Communications Manager under 1.2 extended edition you 're looking at a 4Mb requirement .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #86:1>
OS/2 is a hungry beast and makes best use of the memory available , loading DLLs where required and holding them in memory if possible .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #87:1>
A new version of OS/2 , nicknamed OS/2 &lsquo; Lite &rsquo; is on the way and this will hopefully enable OS/2 to run on machines with 2Mb of system memory - a common size shipped with today 's PCs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #88:1>
The kernel has been re-coded for compactness and the more frequently used DLL routines gathered into one DLL .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #89:1>
Rumours also indicate that it may be faster .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #90:1>
XGA
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #91:1>
The recent announcement of the PS/2 Model 90 and 95 shows that IBM is at last responding to the marketplace demands for fast , high capacity file servers - in the case of the Model 95 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #92:1>
The Model 90 fills the requirements of a very fast workstation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #93:1>
One of the main talking points is the introduction with this range of XGA ( Extended Graphics Adaptor ) , an evolution of VGA .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #94:1>
It is compatible with VGA and provides enhanced resolution , colour content and hardware function .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #95:1>
The standard XGA comes with 512k of RAM capable of displaying 1024 x 768 with 16 colours and 640 x 480 with 256 colours .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #96:1>
Add an additional 512k of RAM and 1024 x 768 with 256 colours is available .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #97:1>
The XGA represents the new standard that IBM is trying to introduce for high-end machines and is backed up by the release of full technical information about the system to allow third-party developers to adopt it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #98:1>
The VGA VRAM interface is extended to 16 bits from the usual 8-bit width , providing up to double the speed .

Added to this , the card provides hardware assistance for GUIs by means of block fills and moves .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #100:1>
It is these types of video displays , offering a high screen content ( 1024 x 768 ) with hardware assistance to keep the performance up , that will help the acceptance of GUIs and OS/2 in particular . &black-square;

One of the crowd
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #102:2>
The term &lsquo; groupware &rsquo; is being bandied about far too freely as far as Ralph Bancroft is concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #103:2>
He points out that software &lsquo; suitable for workgroup computing &rsquo; should be just that .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #104:2>
A colleague recently returned , somewhat perplexed , from a half day event entitled &lsquo; Seminar on workgroup CAD &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #105:2>
Why was he perplexed ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #106:2>
He was genuinely interested in managing CAD/CAM within a group environment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #107:2>
So what did he find at the seminar ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #108:2>
Autodesk demonstrated Autocad and said that it 's a very fine CAD/CAM system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #109:2>
Which it is .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #110:2>
Novell demonstrated NetWare and said that it 's a very fine network operating system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #111:2>
Which it is .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #112:2>
And Compaq demonstrated a SystemPro and said that it 's a very fine box for running Autocad and Novell NetWare .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #113:2>
Which it is .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #114:2>
And that was it .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #115:2>
There was no mention of how to manage multiple files among multiple users .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #116:2>
No utilities to archive and track revisions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #117:2>
No discussion on building up libraries of commonly used drawings that can be used as building blocks .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #118:2>
In short , the definition of workgroup computing boiled down to running a standalone application on a network workstation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #119:2>
Needless to say , my colleague considered the morning to be a complete waste of time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #120:2>
This view of workgroup computing is , regrettably , all too common .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #121:2>
For PC software houses , all that the network versions of their top selling packages provide is some form of file or record locking .
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #122:2>
That 's fine as far as it goes ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-036 #123:2>
at least it prevents two users trying to make changes to the same file at the same time .

Almost as soon as it regained financial stability in the I960s , BMW added a coup&eacute; to its model range .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #18:1>
In 1989 the long and successful life of the second-generation car came to an end , and a new 8-Series coup&eacute coup√à was launched .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #19:1>
The 8-Series , like other BMW coup&eacute;s coup√às before it , had a unique body style , but picked up its running gear from other BMW family cars .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #20:1>
In this case the engine was a mighty V12 unit , recently put on sale in the 750i saloon , as was the transmission , while the suspension was a mixture of units from that car , and a brand new rear suspension intended for other BMW models to use in the 1990s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #21:1>
The new 8-Series car , like its predecessors , had its engine up front , driving the rear wheels , and featured a close-coupled 4-seater layout .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #22:1>
At first there was only a closed coup&eacute; coup√à style coup√à style , though a convertible version was wide<l>ly forecast for launch in the early l990s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #23:1>
As with all such modern cars , it had a very &lsquo; slippery &rsquo; shape , and the car could probably have reached speeds of well over 170mph ( 273kmh ) if BMW had not voluntarily gov<l>erned maximum speeds to around 155mph ( 249kmh ) by electronic means .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #24:1>
The V12 engine was the first such unit to be put on sale by BMW , and was a design masterpiece , in technical detail , looks and construction .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #25:1>
Even so , as specified for the 850i , it was only at the beginning of its development , for it had only a single overhead camshaft per cylinder bank .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #26:1>
However , even though it had two valves per cylinder , and was tuned more for docility , reliability and environ<l>ment cleanliness , it still produced a very reliable 300bhp .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #27:1>
Further developments of the design , some with twin over<l>head camshafts and 4-valve heads , were slated for use on other BMW models of the 1990s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #28:1>
The 8-Series model and the engine which powered it were superbly detailed , in a manner possible from only a handful of European concerns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #29:1>
In leisurely use the engine was almost entirely inaudible , ultra-smooth and totally free of any temperament .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #30:1>
Even so , the engine spun happily up to 5500rpm and beyond , giving just a hint of its awesome potential .

This car looked magnificent and was boldly specified , but it was a complete sales failure .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #49:1>
Bugatti of France designed the Type 41 or &lsquo; golden Bugatti &rsquo; as an unsurpassed carriage , as a car for kings .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #50:1>
However even though it was called the Royale , and Ettore Bugatti made sure that it got a great deal of advance publicity , it was almost unsaleable .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #51:1>
In every way the Royale was the biggest , if not actually the best .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #52:1>
It was the longest , the most powerful and the heaviest private car so far built .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #53:1>
Its engine was originally intended for use in aircraft , and weighed as much as the average small car of the day .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #54:1>
In most respects this was the wrong car , of the wrong type , produced at the wrong time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #55:1>
Although members of the nobility inspected the car , none bought one .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #56:1>
In the end only three private sales were achieved in six years - one each in France , Germany and the UK - and three other cars were built , and used , by members of the Bugatti family .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #57:1>
Various coachbuilt bodies were used on various chassis ( more than one car has been rebodied ) -
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #58:1>
all six have survived , and today they are virtu<l>ally priceless .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #59:1>
The chassis was conventional , but ran on a monstrous 14ft 2in ( 4.3m ) wheelbase , with the engine up front and the 3-speed gearbox mounted in unit with the back axle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #60:1>
Once the car was moving , the direct second gear could be en<l>gaged , with top so high that it was strictly for autoroute cruising .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #61:1>
The engine was a colossal straight-eight , with overhead valve gear , a single overhead camshaft and three valves per cylinder .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #62:1>
The prototype Royale used a 14.7-litre/897CID , but for production a somewhat smaller 12.7-litre/779CID size was chosen instead .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #63:1>
By any standards the Type 41 was the biggest , the heav<l>iest and the most powerful car so far produced for commer<l>cial sale .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #64:1>
By Bugatti standards it was not technically advanced - smaller Bugattis used similar technical layouts - merely bigger and grander , in all respects .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #65:1>
There was , however , dry sump lubrication ( this was a heritage from the original aircraft application ) , and the engine produced no less than 300bhp .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #66:1>
The problem was that the Royale was so heavy - an average unladen weight was 5600lb ( 2540kg ) - and the engine so inefficient in its breathing , that the car 's perfor<l>mance was not as high as one might have expected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #67:1>
All in all , it was an utterly impractical flight of Gallic fancy -
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #68:1>
but the world of motoring would have been poorer without it .

Although the first Cadillac Eldorado was launched in 1953 , the type introduced for 1967 was completely different from its predecessors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #87:1>
Not only was it a new and smart coup&eacute; style , but it also had front-wheel-drive .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #88:1>
By the mid-1980s most American cars would have front-wheel-drive &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #89:1>
in the mid-1960s , when the Eldorado and its sister car the Olds<l>mobile Toronado were designed , it was a real novelty .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #90:1>
For Cadillac , the front-drive Eldorado was a completely new concept , intended to take the type a full step clear of cars like the Ford Thunderbird , with which it was to com<l>pete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #91:1>
Like most American cars of the day , it was big and heavy , though its cabin was quite small .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #92:1>
Original front-drive Eldorados ran on a 120in ( 304cm ) wheelbase , which might be short by Cadillac standards , but was as long as a com<l>plete BMC Mini-Minor !
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #93:1>
A typical Eldorado weighed about 4600lb ( 2086kg ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #94:1>
As in the Toronado , the Eldorado 's engine sat above the line of the front suspension , with Hy-Vo chain drive to the automatic transmission , which was alongside , and under , the engine .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #95:1>
There was torsion bar front suspension , but because there was no drive to the rear wheels these were linked by a &lsquo; dead &rsquo; axle and half-elliptic springs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #96:1>
The V8 engine , at first , was a massive update of the cor<l>porate Cadillac design , which had been substantially new for 1963 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #97:1>
It was a 429CID unit , producing 340bhp .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #98:1>
Then , for 1968 , an all-new 472CID V8 was introduced , an engine immediately enlarged to 400CID and no less than 400bhp ( gross ) for 1970 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #99:1>
All these engines were big , lazy , reliable and long lasting cast-iron V8s in the true North American tradition -
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #100:1>
in fact they were the largest , in displacement , on sale anywhere in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #101:1>
Cadillac used the same engines , in near identical tune , in all the models in its line-up , and they were equally at home in the Eldorado as in the stretched limousines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #102:1>
The engines , of course , were outstanding by any stan<l>dards , even though their quoted outputs were &lsquo; gross &rsquo; - which means that they cannot be compared , directly , with European engines listed in &lsquo; nett &rsquo; form .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #103:1>
They needed to be , of course .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #104:1>
Cars like the Eldorado were heavy and poor aerodynamically , ( aerodynamIcs were simply ignored ) and their automatic transmissions were in<l>efficient .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #105:1>
It was no wonder that top speeds ( where they could be achieved in a country riddled with speed limits ) were limited , and fuel economy awful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #106:1>
Nothing , however , could detract from the sheer muscle , allied to some refinement , of Cadillacs built in this period , for during the 1970s exhaust emission limitations saw the power ratings gradually reduced .

The Corvette 's career started slowly in 1953 , when it was equipped with an old style 6-cylinder engine and automatic transmission .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #126:1>
Things looked up when Chevrolet 's first V8 was offered in 1955 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #127:1>
By 1960 the Corvette had more power options and could be a really fast car .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #128:1>
Corvette performance was at its height in the 1960s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #129:1>
V8 engine options increased in power as the decade pro<l>gressed , but from 1971 the new exhaust emissions laws led to a progressive de-tuning .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #130:1>
Although all Corvettes were 2-seater sports cars , with front-mounted engines and glass-flbre bodies , there were three different Corvette generations in the 1960s , several facelifts and a multitude of options .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #131:1>
The famous Sting Ray style was launched for 1963 , while the &lsquo; Mako Shark &rsquo; style displaced it for 1968 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #132:1>
Early ' 60s cars had a beam rear axle , but from 1963 there was independent rear suspension , with four-wheel disc brakes following for 1965 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #133:1>
There were two types of V8 , both being Chevrolet-<l>designed cast-iron overhead-valve units .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #134:1>
The ' small-block ' type , originally revealed in the mid-1950s , grew from 265CID in the 1955 model to 400CID in the late 1970s &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #135:1>
in European terms that is 4.3 to 6.55 litres .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #136:1>
It was a lightweight unit which , in highly-tuned form , was a free-revving unit used in many other cars , and in several types of motorsport .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #137:1>
In addition , there was the much larger &lsquo; large block &rsquo; Chev<l>rolet engine , first used in Corvettes of 1965 , which started life at 396CID and was progressively enlarged to 454CID ( 6.5 to 7.4 litres ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #138:1>
This was typical Detroit &lsquo; heavy-metal &rsquo; , being physically much larger and heavier than the &lsquo; small-<l>block &rsquo; design , slower-revving , but bursting with steam-<l>engine-like torque .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #139:1>
In both cases the power ratings looked better than they were , for they were quoted &lsquo; gross &rsquo; , before various in-car losses were taken into effect .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #140:1>
Even so , the V8 powered Corvettes could , and often did , out-run imported sports cars costing several times as much , all with engines no more highly tuned than those used in other Chevrolet models .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #141:1>
Unless a Corvette was sadly neglected , its running gear lasted almost indefinitely , bringing really spine-tingling acceleration within the reach of the young , and the not-so-<l>well-off , among America 's drivers .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #142:1>
Then , as later , the Cor<l>vette was the sports car which every American driver wanted to own .

Chevrolet announced the new generation Corvette in 1983 , a car which combined beauty and advanced engineering at amazingly competitive prices .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #161:1>
There was a new backbone chassis frame with all independent suspension , and a sleek body style featuring a hatchback and a removable roof panel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #162:1>
On the original production cars the standard engine was a 205bhp version of the latest &lsquo; small block &rsquo; 350CID/5.7-litre V8 , with fuel injection , but still with pushrod-operated over<l->head valve gear .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #163:1>
Soon after this GM absorbed the British Lotus concern , and set its designers to produce a magnificent engine especially for Corvette use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #164:1>
The result , unveiled In 1989 , was the superb Corvette ZR-1 , certainly the fastest Corvette yet built , and one of the fastest production sports cars in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #165:1>
The ZR-1 used all the well-proven elements of the mid-1980s Corvette , but improved them considerably .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #166:1>
The engine was a beautifully detailed 350CID , all aluminium , and with new cylinder heads featuring twin overhead cam<l>shafts and four valves per cylinder producing a very genuine 380bhp ( DIN ) at 6000rpm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #167:1>
Although that sounds to be less than that of engines fitted to 1960s &lsquo; Vettes , the peak was measured in a different way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #168:1>
Without doubt , this was the most powerful Corvette so far produced .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #169:1>
In addition , for economy driving the engine effectively operated on only half of its valves , benefiting from an in<l>genious variable valve timing system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #170:1>
Backing it was a massive 6-speed ZF gearbox , and the suspension had been reworked to make this a real &lsquo; super-<l>car &rsquo; package .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #171:1>
Although the ZR-1 had only rear-wheel-drive , its 275/40 section 17in ( 43cm ) tyres , on 11in ( 28cm ) rear rims , coped splendidly with all the brute power .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #172:1>
Looking little different from the normal Corvette , the ZR-1 performed like a Ferrari or a Lamborghini , made all the right supercar noises , yet met all USA legislation , and was sold at prices ludicrously low by comparison .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #173:1>
Once the Italians suggested that Detroit could never even begin to approach their own standards of performance , handling , and technical sophistication .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #174:1>
With the ZR-1 they had to think again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #175:1>
In the 1990s , who knows what may hap<l>pen ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #176:1>
The ZR-1 might overtake the Italians in prestige as well as in performance ...

Although Chrysler 's 300 &lsquo; Letter &rsquo; models were based on the same chassis and suspension as other current Chrysler models , they were always equipped with the most power<l>ful possible engines , and fitted with a series of individual coup&eacute; and convertible body styles and convertible body styles and convertible body styles and convertible body styles .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #195:1>
The &lsquo; Letter &rsquo; name comes because every model year Chrysler changed the model title .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #196:1>
The original car was the 300 , that sold in 1956 was the 300B , in 1957 it was the 300C , this continuing to 1965 and the model 300L when the pres<l>tigious range was dropped .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #197:1>
Production was strictly limited -
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #198:1>
in 1958 , for instance , only 809 cars were built , and in 1961 only 1617 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-037 #199:1>
Chrysler sold these at a premium price , with an &lsquo; exclusive &rsquo; tag .

DIGITAL COMPACT CASSETTE : THE WHOLE STORY
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #2:1>
With a working prototype demonstrated at Las Vegas CES , Philips has finally unveiled the new digital tape format which could undermine and outlive R-DAT
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #3:1>
by Barry Fox
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #4:1>
Philips has now given more technical details of DCC , and how the system was specified during 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X5:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X12:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #13:1>
DAT uses digital linear PCM coding , very similar to CD coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #14:1>
With error correction the data rate to tape is 2.46 MBit/s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #15:1>
&lsquo; This high density recording is an engineer 's choice &rsquo; says Wirtz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X16:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #17:1>
&lsquo; Our targets set the standard for DCC &rsquo; , he explains .

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X23:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #24:1>
Philips looked first at ADPCM ( Adapa<l>tive Delta PCM , as used for CD-I ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #25:1>
The system encodes only the difference between samples , but does so in 4- or 8-bit PCM words .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #26:1>
Quality is inevitably compromised .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #27:1>
Then Philips looked at sub-band coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #28:1>
This technology was already being developed , for instance as a Eureka project , for radio broadcasting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #29:1>
The technique , now refined and known as Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding , or PASC , takes advantage of the masking effect of the human ear , on which noise reduction systems like Dolby depend .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #30:1>
If the human ear hears two sounds of similar frequency at the same time , the louder sound masks the quieter sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #31:1>
So if musical notes are swamped by louder notes of similar pitch they need not be coded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #32:1>
If the sound spectrum is divided in to into separate frequency bands , each can be separately coded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #33:1>
Bands which contain either no sound at all , or sound which is masked , need less coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #34:1>
Only the bands in which there is audible sound need precision coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #35:1>
This saves on the total number of bits needed per second .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #36:1>
The first experiments with PASC needed a large computer and took around eight hours to process ten seconds of mono sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #37:1>
Now , of course , PASC works in real time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #38:1>
Philips ' first prototype DCC decks , made in mid 1989 , used what Philips now describes as &lsquo; primitive fixed coding &rsquo; , with each band coded by a fixed number of bits per second .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #39:1>
&lsquo; This was the turning point &rsquo; , recalls Wirtz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X40:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X41:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X42:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X43:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #44:1>
At this stage Philips decided on diffe<l>rent objectives from the Eureka and digital radio projects .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #45:1>
Whereas the broadcasters ' aim was an average of around 2 or 2.5-bits per sample ( compared to 16-bits for CD and DAT ) Philips went for 4-bits to give the system headroom .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #46:1>
Even by then it looked likely that results from 4-bits PASC coding could eventually better the sound from 16-bit CD or DAT PCM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #47:1>
The final form of the PASC system is now fixed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #48:1>
The sound is digitally filtered into 32 , fixed-frequency bands .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #49:1>
The number of bits used in each band varies depending on the signal con<l>tent , up to 15 bits .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #50:1>
This creates a bit pool of sufficient capacity to average at 4-bits .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #51:1>
A small amount of dither ( random noise ) is added to the recorded signal to conceal coding errors .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #52:1>
The final data rate , for stereo , with error correction and auxiliary codes ( eg for indexing and Teletext-style displays ) is 0.77-Mbit/s .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #53:1>
The track pattern and head lay-out were designed back in April 1989 , when DCC was still known under the working name Decor .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #54:1>
The smallest recorded wavelength is 0.99 microns .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #55:1>
The DCC tracks are recorded with a width of 185 microns but read with 70-micron heads .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #56:1>
This is intended to create tolerances for tape weave .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #57:1>
Certainly first tests suggest that it is possible to treat the cassette quite roughly :
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #58:1>
tapping it before playback did not affect performance .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #59:1>
The heads are formed in the same manner as integrated circuits , by lithog<l>raphic techniques on a single silicon wafer .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #60:1>
The electronics for many strips is grown on a large circular wafer which is later diced into individual chips .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #61:1>
The first growth layer creates a double strip of magneto-resistive heads , for reading both analogue and digital signals from tape ( changes in magnetism vary the resistance conductor ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #62:1>
Then a second layer of mag<l>neto-inductive heads is grown on top for digital recording .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #63:1>
Completely separate heads are needed for analogue erasure and recording , so this feature may well be excluded from decks , for cost considera<l>tions , while no erase heads are needed for digital recording .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #64:1>
The head chips are used in pairs , to provide electrical switching for auto-reverse .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #65:1>
Although this is instant , the tape still takes a finite time to reverse direc<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #66:1>
So there is a brief but noticeable gap in the sound .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #67:1>
The cassette must be made to fight tolerances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #68:1>
Matsushita is a co-licensor with Philips , as Sony was on CD .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #69:1>
Also as with CD , royalties will be payable on both hard<l>ware and software .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #70:1>
The amounts are not yet agreed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #71:1>
The cassette has spool holes on only one side and does not flip over .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #72:1>
These holes , and the tape path , are protected by a slider which opens only when the cassette is loaded in a deck .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #73:1>
The two sides of the tape are called &lsquo; sectors &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #74:1>
A search head will scan the auxiliary track during fast wind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #75:1>
Access will be faster than for conventional Compact Cassette , because the search head scans both sectors of the tape simultaneously , and switches from sector to sector .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #76:1>
But search will not be as fast as DAT , which on the new Technics machines is at 400-times playing speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #77:1>
Both Philips and Matsushita are now making DCC chip sets and the first batch of Philips chips were ready to mount on a single board inside the stand-alone deck unit in time for CES at Las Vegas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #78:1>
The same chip set works either for DCC or digital audio broadcasting with 2 or 2.5 half bits .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #79:1>
The DCC chips will also recog<l>nize a double-play mono cassette , ie a cassette in which each stereo channel contains a different mono recording .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #80:1>
This will double the playing time to 180 minutes for mono re-releases .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #81:1>
DCC 's Achilles ' heel is playing time : so far only 90 minutes with 120 mins prom<l>ised from thinner tape ( 9 instead of 11 microns ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #82:1>
And this time is split in the middle by a gap while the tape direction reverses .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #83:1>
Although only a fraction of a second , it is noticeable unless pre-recorded software is timed to match programme breaks with tape reverses .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #84:1>
And the gap makes DCC less than ideal for time-shifting radio .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #85:1>
Why didn't Philips provide a half-speed option to double playing time , with 2-bit coding accuracy ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #86:1>
Philips says this would block off access to existing tape mechanisms which play at only the standard 4.76 cm/s speed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #87:1>
For the record , I believe this is a potentially disastrous mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #88:1>
DAT routinely offers at least 2 hours unbroken playing time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #89:1>
By providing a half-speed option on DCC , as with VHS video , Philips could have given users the choice of standard or long-play recording .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #90:1>
Pre-recorded musicassettes would of course all be at standard speed , as with video .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #91:1>
Half speed recording could still match digital radio quality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #92:1>
Home tapers could choose , depending on programme length and the need to avoid an auto-reverse gap .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #93:1>
As DCC is not due to go on sale until Spring 1992 , I personally urge Philips to think again about offering a long play option from Day One .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #94:1>
Philips is cagey about price predictions , but argues that because R-DAT relies on a precision mechanism , with servo control and rotary head mechanism , it will always be more expensive than DCC .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #95:1>
The new format relies on the same tape mechanism as a conventional Compact Cassette recorder and manufacturing the heads like microchips may well make them cheaper than conventional analogue heads .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #96:1>
Wirtz predicts that the digital coding circuits will , by the 4th/5th generation of DCC machines , be in a single chip .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #X97:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #98:1>
Pre-recorded software prices , he claims , can be equally low .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #99:1>
Philips ' sub<l>sidiary PolyGram is already building a DCC duplication factory at Amarsfort , near Baarn in Holland .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #100:1>
This proves that DCC can be duplicated , at 64-times nor<l>mal speed , on a master and slave system very similar to those already conven<l>tionally used by the music industry .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #101:1>
The only difference is that the slaves need new DCC chip heads .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #102:1>
Consumer decks will be made by Marantz in Japan , and Philips in Vienna .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #103:1>
Car DCC will be produced by Philips ' in-car audio factory at Wetzlar in Ger<l>many .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #104:1>
There will be a high-end DCC deck from Technics &lsquo; for sure &rsquo; , says Wirtz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #105:1>
Both Philips and Matsushita are already making personal stereos .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #106:1>
Philips has three mock-ups to show .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #107:1>
Tandy is also making DCC products .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #108:1>
Other announcements , prob<l>ably including the logical commitment from the Thomson group ( including Fer<l>guson ) are expected soon .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #109:1>
Early dreams of forwards compatibility , with the same cassette holding both digital and analogue versions of the same recording , never came to fruition .

&lsquo; We tried all kinds of crazy ideas for putting analogue and digital recordings on the same tape &rsquo; , says Wirtz , &lsquo; but we found we can't do it - yet &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #111:1>
Incidentally , although the signal may sound the same after recording and play<l>back , it certainly does not look the same when analysed electronically .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #112:1>
Philips already recognizes that the coding and decoding process could degrade sound if a DCC recording is copied and re-copied , because each generation will add its own errors and interpolations .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #113:1>
But this hardly worries the recording industry , who want to deter multi-generation copying .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #114:1>
DCC incorporates the serial copy management system , SCMS , which prevents cloning of digital copies .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #115:1>
&lsquo; We have very great expectations for this technology &rsquo; , says Gijs Wirtz .

Philips claims that no bands are treated as empty and effectively &lsquo; gated &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #122:1>
Gating is something which has already started to worry critics of sub-band coding , and of which we shall be hearing a lot more later .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #123:1>
Indeed as Gijs Wirtz says , DCC and PASC will give hi-fi journalists plenty to write about for the next ten years .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #124:1>
DCC CODING : BASICS
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #125:1>
The following description is taken direct from Philips ' technical presentation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #126:1>
The block diagram ( Fig. 1 ) shows the main functions of DCC coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #127:1>
Well-known techniques are employed for Analogue-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analogue conver<l>sion , Error Detection and Correction , and Channel Modulation and Demodulation , although for DCC optimal methods have been developed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #128:1>
DCC , however , also introduces PASC , Precision Adaptive Sub<l>band coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #129:1>
PASC applies sophisticated chip technology and new insight into hearing phenomena and the behaviour of the ear , and is said to introduce a degree of accuracy and refinement not previously associated with this type of coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #130:1>
PASC concentrates on maximizing the efficiency of the digital coding , to create the room needed for higher precision .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #131:1>
To achieve this , it takes into account three factors not previously considered in digital audio .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #132:1>
1 ) The ear only hears sound above a certain level called the threshold of hear<l>ing , which depends on the frequency of the sound an and on the individual .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #133:1>
This means that it is only necessary to register sound above this threshold , providing that the threshold is taken as the reference for both recording and playback ( Figs. 2&ampersand;3 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #134:1>
2 ) Louder sounds hide , or mask , softer sounds in their vicinity .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #135:1>
A whisper , per<l>fectly audible in a quiet room , will not be heard in a busy street .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #136:1>
In fact , louder sounds dynamically adapt the threshold of hearing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #137:1>
With computer techniques , it is possible to follow this dynamic threshold adaptation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #138:1>
Then , only the sounds above this dynamic threshold need to be reg<l>istered .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #139:1>
This must still be done during both recording and playback ( Figs 4&ampersand;5 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #140:1>
3 ) A sufficient &lsquo; bit bank &rsquo; must be available to register all the sound above the dyna<l>mic threshold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #141:1>
In practice , however , only white noise ever occupies the entire sound spectrum at any one time .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #142:1>
In music there are &lsquo; open spaces &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #143:1>
In these &lsquo; open spaces &rsquo; no bits are needed for registration .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #144:1>
This creates &lsquo; spare bits &rsquo; , which can be adaptively allocated to other regions to increase the registration accuracy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #145:1>
PASC achieves very efficient sound registration indeed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #146:1>
It needs less than one quarter of the bit rate of Compact Disc 's PCM .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #147:1>
This level of efficiency creates adequate room for precise registration of what the ear actually hears .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #148:1>
How PASC works
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #149:1>
The audio frequency range is split , by digital filtering , into 32 sub-bands of equal width .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #150:1>
The PASC signal processor models the aural characteristics of the spiral cochlea inside the ear , taking the threshold of hearing ( of the most sensitive human ear ) as its basic reference .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #151:1>
As the sound is registered , the signal processor continuously adapts to the dynamic variations of the threshold .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #152:1>
Efficiency is increased since only sounds above this dynamic threshold , and thus audible , are accepted for coding .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #153:1>
Every sub-band is allocated the bit capacity it needs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #154:1>
The bits not required by particular sub-bands are re-allocated , adaptively , to other sub-bands to achieve the highest possible coding accuracy over the entire audio frequency range .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #155:1>
Hence , PASC coding takes the behaviour of the ear as the reference model , and uses the chip technology of the 1990s to emulate that model .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #156:1>
The coded information for all the sub-bands is multiplexed into an 8-channel data stream , into which error detection and correction codes are inserted .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #157:1>
The distribution of the block codes over the 8 data channels achieves an effect similar to interleaving .
<ICE-GB:W2B-038 #158:1>
A ninth channel , carrying the control and display auxiliary channel is added , to optimize the data format for recording on tape , then completes the signal processing , seen in the block diagram .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #1:1>
PORTABLE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AIDS
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #2:1>
&square; ALLTALK
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #3:1>
The upper surface of the Alltalk comprises a membrane keyboard which is divided into 128 keys , each 25mm square .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #4:1>
Using the microphone supplied , a therapist or helper can record words or phrases which can be recalled and spoken through a built-in loudspeaker when a key is pressed by the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #5:1>
As the speech is digitised , any vocabulary may be recorded , in any language , and the voice chosen to suit the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #6:1>
A paper overlay held in place over the keyboard indicates the vocabulary associated with the different areas of the keyboard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #7:1>
Any number of keys may be used to produce a particular word or phrase .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #8:1>
For example , the keyboard might be divided into only two areas to enable a user to indicate &ldquo; yes &rdquo; and &ldquo; no &rdquo; , or all 128 keys be used to provide a much wider vocabulary .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #9:1>
In the standard version , two &lsquo; levels &rsquo; are provided - each location may be used to produce two different utterances - and a total of 128 seconds of speech may be recorded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #10:1>
The memory may be increased to allow up to 256 seconds of speech to be recorded and stored on four levels .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #11:1>
Although the expansion provides the user with access to a wider range of expression , switching between levels can reduce the rate of output .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #12:1>
Utterances may therefore be built up word by word and spoken out when complete .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #13:1>
Although the Alltalk is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery , its size and weight make it less suitable as a portable aid .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #14:1>
However , if the Alltalk can be mounted on a wheelchair or used in one location such as a classroom , it can provide a flexible and effective means of expression .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #15:1>
A keyguard is available .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #16:1>
&square; SMALL ALLTALK
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #17:1>
Similar in specification to the Alltalk , the Small Alltalk differs only in its overall size and that of the 128 keys which are each 19mm square .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #18:1>
There is also less space between the keys .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #19:1>
Although it is less bulky , therefore , the Small Alltalk is similar in weight and requires greater pointing accuracy on the part of the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #20:1>
A keyguard is available which may help prevent accidental key presses .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #21:1>
&square; AVOCA
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #22:1>
This portable communicator has a 128-key membrane keyboard , guarded by a plastic keyguard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #23:1>
48 of the keys display symbols and pressing these recalls stored words and phrases which are spoken out by a speech synthesiser .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #24:1>
A range of pre-programmed everyday sentences is supplied with the device but these can be changed to suit the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #25:1>
64 keys form an alphanumeric keyboard to allow words and phrases to be typed in .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #26:1>
The phrases are shown on a two line 80-character LCD display and can be spoken directly or saved for later use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #27:1>
This area of the keyboard and the display can also be used for word processing and a parallel printer port allows text to be printed out .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #28:1>
The number keys can be used as a speaking calculator .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #29:1>
Other keys include a &lsquo; HELP &rsquo; key to summon help , a &lsquo; TALK &rsquo; key to speak out messages and others to control output volume and view angle .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #30:1>
A socket is provided to enable headphones to be used when preparing text or messages .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #31:1>
The Avoca has built-in rechargeable batteries and automatically &lsquo; powers down &rsquo; when not in use .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #32:1>
It is also intended to be operated by a joystick or by scanning using a switch although these options are not yet developed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #33:1>

<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #44:1>
&square; DIGITALLY AIDED VOICE EMULATOR - DAVE
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #45:1>
Using the external microphone provided , a therapist or helper may record up to sixteen words or phrases which , by means of a single switch , can be selected for playback by the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #46:1>
The display panel on the front of the device has a grid of sixteen areas each with a small red indicator lamp .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #47:1>
Words , symbols or pictures drawn on the panel or on a paper overlay are used to indicate the location of the different utterances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #48:1>
To select a message , the user operates his/her switch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #49:1>
A &lsquo; beep-beep &rsquo; attracts the attention of a listener and the grid is then scanned , each lamp being illuminated in turn .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #50:1>
When the appropriate area is indicated , the user operates the switch again and the word or phrase recorded for that area is spoken out .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #51:1>
The device may also be set to scan only four , larger areas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #52:1>
There are five speed settings for the rate at which the display is scanned although the slowest rate may be too great for some users .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #53:1>
When operated , the panel is scanned only once and , if the required area is missed , the user must initiate scanning again .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #54:1>
The speech is digitised and any vocabulary may therefore be recorded , in any language , in a voice selected to suit the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #55:1>
Utterances with a combined total length of up to 60 seconds can be recorded and the speech quality is good although the output volume cannot be controlled by the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #56:1>
A key is provided which , when removed , ensures that messages cannot be accidentally over-recorded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #57:1>
The device is powered by a rechargeable battery .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #58:1>
An alternative version of the device for use on a wheelchair has a control box and a separate display panel on a flexible mount positioned to suit the user .

&square; ECHO-4
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #60:1>
This small portable device has a built-in microphone and speaker which enable up to four words or phrases to be recorded by a helper or therapist .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #61:1>
The user can play back these recorded messages by pressing one of four switches on the device or remotely connected .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #62:1>
Any switches with the appropriate connectors may be used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #63:1>
However , no scanning facility is available and those who can operate only a single switch or double switches are therefore limited to using only one or two utterances .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #64:1>
The speech is digitised and any vocabulary , in any language , may therefore be recorded in a voice chosen to suit the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #65:1>
The quality of the speech is good although there is no volume control .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #66:1>
Approximately three seconds of speech may be recorded for each switch .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #67:1>
The device has no on/off switch and is therefore ready for immediate use .

The 16 squares which make up the display panel on the front of the box are lit from behind .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #83:1>
Words , pictures or symbols are drawn on a transparent overlay and this is placed over the display panel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #84:1>
Two methods of selection are available ,
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #85:1>
either the lamps illuminate automatically in turn and the user presses a switch when a desired square is reached or the lamps illuminate in turn when the switch is pressed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #86:1>
The number of squares used and the scanning sequence may be pre-programmed using the 16 buttons on the back of the device .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #87:1>
If required the user may have only two squares from which to select and progress to four , eight and eventually sixteen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #88:1>
The device is portable and is powered by rechargeable batteries .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #89:1>
&square; INTRO TALKER

This portable communication aid has a membrane keyboard with thirty-two touch-sensitive areas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #91:1>
It may also be configuered configured to use eight larger areas .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #92:1>
Words or phrases are recorded by a helper or therapist using the built-in microphone or an external microphone and , by touching the appropriate area of the keyboard .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #93:1>
These utterances can be played back through a built-in loudspeaker by the user .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #94:1>
Messages can be stored to be used individually or recalled as sequences .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #95:1>
Programming the areas is relatively easy and , as the speech is digitised , any vocabulary in any language may be used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #96:1>
However , the quality of the speech output is disappointing even when an external speaker is used .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #97:1>
The messages associated with the different areas on the keyboard are indicated by words , symbols or pictures on an overlay which is held in place with the plastic 32-hole keyguard supplied .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #98:1>
An eight-hole keyguard is available although this is expensive in comparison with the cost of the device .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #99:1>
The Intro Talker can be used as a communication aid in its own right or as an an introduction for a user who may progress to the Touch Talker ( see below ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-039 #100:1>

TRANSPORTS THE BEST ON TEST
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #2:1>
How much difference can the CD transport section make to CD sound quality ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #3:1>
Should you buy a separate transport unit and , if so , which one ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #4:1>
This survey gives some answers ...
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #5:1>
by Martin Colloms
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #6:1>
While the vast majority of CD systems comprise one-box self-contained players , a small mar<l>ket is developing for replay via separate components .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #7:1>
On the electronics side the digital decoder appeared first , since many players also provided a suitable digital output .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #8:1>
In this mode the player is being used simply as a transport , a unit de<l>signated to play a CD and process the resulting coded digital signal to the stage where it is suitable for transmission in a standardized way .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #9:1>
For domestic systems the code for the combined two-channel data is called SPDIF , which stands for Sony-Philips Digital Interface Format .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #10:1>
This is an HF signal running on a single connection and requires a broad-band RF-grade feed to transmit it satisfactorily between digital audio units .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #11:1>
Some agreement has been reached over the methods of transmission , which include a low-cost and effective wired connection using cable terminated in phono-plugs , and the more elegant alternative of an optical fibre link .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #12:1>
Here , the digital signals are sent as flashes of red light down a thin light-conducting fibre to a receiving photodiode , which repro<l>duces the required electrical signal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #13:1>
For domestic use , Japanese manufacturers have adopted a low-cost optical link using an inexpensive acrylic plastic fibre with the commonly used name of Toslink , after its original producer , Toshiba .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #14:1>
Of ad<l>equate frequency range , this link can produce good results and is available on a wide range of equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #15:1>
Optical transmission has advantages mainly to do with the avoidance of any electrical join between the sender and receiver , whereby potentially damaging noise and interference is not added to the signal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #16:1>
Many owners of digital decoders will be aware of annoying clicks and occasional muting due to local interfer<l>ence ( such as that from thermostats ) when linked by wire to the matching digital transport .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #17:1>
Theoreticians would have us believe that if digital audio data are transmitted correctly , the resulting audio must also be correct .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #18:1>
However , when high demands are made for sound quality it is found that the type and quality of the interface can influence the result , which is not supposed to happen .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #19:1>
One explanation may concern the effects of pulse distortion at the SPDIF receiver .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #20:1>
When digital data are transmit<l>ted over a single parallel interface there is no crosstalk between the codes , ie the date clock , the word-select line , and the two channels of audio information .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #21:1>
Now the SPDIF link is a single channel , where all this data plus other information on subcodes , emphasis , etc , is encoded .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #22:1>
The information is built up as a complex data pattern in a defined serial form , and transmission theory suggests that if the edge speed and timing is preserved then the information encoded will also be preserved .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #23:1>
However , digital theory has an on/off , 0/1 , pure logic view of the data and rarely allows for the calculable effects of finite rise-times and other distortions .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #24:1>
For example , a clock and/or data timing error must be less than one ten thousandth of a microsecond if a 16-bit resolution is to be obtained at 20kHz .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #25:1>
Quite small pulse distortions over a serial link can easily produce such errors in a decoder , with the complexity of the jitter spectrum reflecting &lsquo; intermodulation &rsquo; within the complex time-varying pattern of the serial data .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #26:1>
Jitter simulation has shown that a wide range of subjective changes can occur in reproduced sound quality according to the size and spectral dis<l>tribution of the jitter modulation .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #27:1>
There are clear indications that the quality of a digital interface , its effective bandwidth , phase response , termination , and not least the presence of noise , eg from ground line chassis currents , can affect the final sound quality to varying degrees .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #28:1>
The decks examined
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #29:1>
Models covered are Arcam Delta 170-2 , Krell MD1 ( 1st version ) , Marantz CD95dr , Meridian 208 and 200 , Meridian 602 , Philips CD 630 , Sony 337es , Teac 470 , Technics SLPA10 , Wadia WT3200 , Wadia WT2000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #30:1>
All these decks have been re<l>viewed recently or were borrowed to aid the exploration of differences in sound quality between transports .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #31:1>
Some are included for historical or comparative purposes , while the two Wadias and the Meridian 200 receive fuller attention and are associated with a forthcoming review of the Wadia X64-4 decoder .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #32:1>
People have long demanded a Meridian transport , and essentially the 200 can be regarded as a transport-only version of the 208 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #33:1>
It comes with a small remote control and all the usual features , including wired and optical outputs .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #34:1>
The manufacturer 's usual twin-box style is employed , with Meridian 's own microprocessor looking after the well-respected Philips laser chas<l>sis built into a custom casting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #35:1>
Special care is taken with both acoustic and vibration resistance , as well as with jitter noise on the digital data lines .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #36:1>
The Wadia WT3200 is built in Japan by Marantz and also uses a Philips laser tracking system , with the whole deck built on a massive die-cast chassis .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #37:1>
A 20mm-thick machined alloy panel com<l>pletes the front elevation of this full-width front-loader , which offers a complete pan<l>oply of facilities from programming to A/B repeat , shuffle-play to indexing - although it doesn't have FTS or tape-edit .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #38:1>
The remote handset is well finished , including a 10-key array , contrasting with the highly simplified controls on the front panel .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #39:1>
The display can show track and time simul<l>taneously and includes a track calendar and function indicators .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #40:1>
The WT2000 is another Japanese unit , custom-built for Wadia by Teac .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #41:1>
A two-box unit , the power-supply may be remotely located , linked by an umbilical .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #42:1>
The transport itself is nearly half the normal width at 22.5cm , but is 44cm deep .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #43:1>
Heavily built , it has the absolute minimum of fascia controls : play , open/close , pause and skip .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #44:1>
As with the 3200 , the usual facilities are present on the remote handset , including display off , A/B repeat , and a 10-key array .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #45:1>
&lsquo; Technology &rsquo; features include a wide-band AT &ampersand; T optical output ( also in the 3200 ) , a full cover , and an enveloping CD clamp which damps the disc and is said to reduce flutter .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #46:1>
The underlying chassis is based on a zinc die-casting with anti-microphony suspension system .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #47:1>
The auditioning
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #48:1>
Seems silly doesn't it , listening to CD transports , all with ample error-correction and hence in theory offering identical sound quality ?
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #49:1>
Nobody in the industry really wants CD transports to differ .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #50:1>
It would be very nice to be able to rely on some constant feature such as this , but the facts have to be faced .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #51:1>
For higher performance equipment , CD transports and the mode and quality of digital data transmission can both significantly affect the sound quality perceived via digital decoders , and the tests which show this are easy to arrange .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #52:1>
The outputs to be auditioned remain perfectly matched , and no switch or connection needs to be changed in the audio chain .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #53:1>
Such iron control of the usual common variables provides a framework whereby fairly modest differences in the digital domain may be identified and assessed in the subsequent analogue signal .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #54:1>
Listening tests were conducted with the aid of decoders in three price ranges : the 203 at &pound-sign;500 , the 606 at &pound-sign;1500 and the Wadia X64-4 at &pound-sign;5000 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #55:1>
The 203 is not crystal-locked , while the 606 and the X64-4 are .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #56:1>
Nonetheless , the transport differences reported below were reflected quite consistently across these decoders .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #57:1>
An absolute laboratory reference com<l>bination was assembled : ( a ) where the interface was deleted entirely by the expedient of hardwiring the internal data channel of a test transport to the relevant section of a decoder , and ( b ) where the CD transport was bypassed and an original digital tape played back on a Sony U-Matic to a selected decoder .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #58:1>
These comparisons have established beyond doubt that some loss is experienced in the electro<l>mechanics of CD replay ( and presumably the optical mastering ) , while additional loss is imparted via the serial interface ( SPDIF ) and its execution .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #59:1>
At risk of a further flurry of public attacks concerning my scoring , and my determination to place perceived differ<l>ences and merit on some sort of scale , I propose to score these transports and interfaces ( see Table ) .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #60:1>
The figures , however , are relative , intended simply as a guide , and therefore should not be equated with those for other equipment like amplifiers and CD players .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #61:1>
Arcam Delta 170-2
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #62:1>
This unit imposed a distinctive sound quality , with a surprising degree of glare and hardness , particularly on multi-bit , the effect being ameliorated with low-bit decoders .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #63:1>
The optical mode sweetened the sound , but at the expense of both definition and bass power and articula<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #64:1>
Mild grain was present in the treble .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #65:1>
On the plus side , it showed a good sense of pace and rhythm .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #66:1>
Krell MDI
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #67:1>
This early transport showed its superior<l>ity on grounds of slam , timing and defini<l>tion , with fine stereo focus and depth .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #68:1>
But ultimate approval , in context of price , was withheld due to a degree of hardening in mid-range tonal quality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #69:1>
Marantz CD95dr
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #70:1>
This heavy transport is derived from that used in the Marantz two-box CD12 player .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #71:1>
It improved on a standard Philips design , though not a great deal , with a similar sound but just a little more refined .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #72:1>
Meridian 200
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #73:1>
Such was the performance of this unit ( the 208 player is very similar when used as a transport ) that its sound via the optical line exceeds that of most other transports .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #74:1>
It manages to combine super<l>ior definition with tonal neutrality , and was the best of its kind in the group below the 602 .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #75:1>
Meridian 602
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #76:1>
Despite the fitting of a broader bandwidth optical driver , the wired mode still beat it if decent cable was employed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #77:1>
The 602 improved on the 200 by its superior sense of rhythm and pace , better focus and dynamics , and a reduction in grain and &lsquo; edge &rsquo; on the treble .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #78:1>
Philips CD 630
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #79:1>
This unit was included to help assess the choice of an existing CD player of the basic type when used as a transport .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #80:1>
Performing well above average in this role , it was fascinating to see that the funda<l>mentally well tuned and lively character so well known from the better Philips players was to some degree present at source - ie in the received digital data .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #81:1>
Sony 337es
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #82:1>
Also borrowed for historical reasons , this well-built player showed admirable depth , clarity and treble purity , with a neutral tonal quality .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #83:1>
But while the resulting sound had good projection , it lacked pace , giving a mildly leaden effect which dis<l>tanced it from the better examples .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #84:1>
Teac 470
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #85:1>
Again included for historical reasons , this unit was reasonably well balanced tonally but sounded mushy , with impaired stereo depth and definition .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #86:1>
The resulting sound was not very coherent and suffered from impaired timing .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #87:1>
As such it illustrated the fact that some players are not really worth using as a transport .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #88:1>
Technics SLPA I 1 0
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #89:1>
This beautifully presented transport-only has a standard optical digital output .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #90:1>
Despite the use of an optimal micro-fibre link , the notes describe a muting of dynamic expression , softened bass , and sufficient impairment of rhythm to make it sound lazy .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #91:1>
Generally smooth , there was a hint of glare in the upper mid-range , and greater clarity would have been helpful .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #92:1>
Wadia WT3200
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #93:1>
When first wired up , the Wadia 3200 was near to rejection on account of a signi<l>ficant Delta-like glare .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #94:1>
However , over a space of two hours it literally warmed up , reducing that steely leanness to a low level .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #95:1>
The result was then in the Meridian class , with firmer bass , fine pace and good dynamics .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #96:1>
Treble clarity and purity were also well above average .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #97:1>
Such was the performance of the AT &ampersand; T optical link that this mode sounded superior to most of the selected digital cables tried , and equalled the best .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #98:1>
This was a valuable feature for this machine in terms of interference and muting .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #99:1>
Wadia WT2000
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #100:1>
Auditioned primarily with the X64-4 , the WT2000 worked well with that decoder , while the high performance of the AT&ampersand;T link was easily confirmed .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #101:1>
In absolute terms , the WT2000 conceded a little in terms of rhythm and pace , but more than made up for this by a surprisingly superior degree of transparency , image depth and tonal quality right into the high treble .
<ICE-GB:W2B-040 #102:1>
It sounded powerful and dynamic , purpose<l>ful and very well focused , with articulate and expressive bass .

Ministers knew of MoD intervention in Wallace affair
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #2:1>
By Colin Brown and Judy Jones
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #3:1>
THE GOVERNMENT admitted last night that ministers knew 12 months ago that Ministry of De<l>fence officials made an improper prior approach to the chairman of the independent inquiry into the dismissal of Colin Wallace , the former Northern Ireland Army press officer , who made allega<l>tions of a conspiracy to bring down the Wilson administration .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #4:1>
Archy Hamilton , Minister of State for Defence , told the Com<l>mons the information was avail<l>able to ministers when they set the terms of the independent inquiry by David Calcutt QC - which at<l>tempted to restrict his inquiry to the actual appearing hearing on 17 October 1975 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #5:1>
In the event , Mr Calcutt breached the terms of his own in<l>quiry , revealed the prior commu<l>nication with the chairman of the hearing and used that as one of the grounds for recommending &pound-sign;30,000 compensation to Mr Wal<l>lace in August .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #6:1>
Mr Hamilton said the Govern<l>ment had been made aware a year ago that Ministry of Defence offi<l>cials had in 1975 been in private communication with the chairman of the Civil Service appeal hearing against Mr Wallace 's dismissal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #7:1>
&ldquo; Such communication was not part of the formal procedures .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #8:1>
It was immediately recognised that the communication could , with hindsight , be held to be unsatis<l>factory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #9:1>
Accordingly , ministers de<l>cided to commission an entirely independent review of the manner in which his case had been pre<l>sented to the appeal board , &rdquo; the minister said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #10:1>
Mr Calcutt had advised that the communication should not have been hidden and added that what occurred &ldquo; probably affected &rdquo; the outcome of the appeal against Mr Wallace 's dismissal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #11:1>
Last February , Tom King , Sec<l>retary of State for Defence , told MPs the papers on the Wallace case revealed no evidence that the decision to terminate his employ<l>ment in 1975 was taken for reasons other than the offence with which he was charged - disclosing clas<l>sified information to the media without proper authority .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #12:1>
Mr Calcutt said in August that his terms of reference , strictly con<l>strued , would require him to limit himself to a consideration of the manner in which Mr Wallace 's case was presented at the hearing which took place before the Civil Service Appeal Board on 17 Octo<l>ber 1975 , and whether that re<l>sulted in an injustice .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #13:1>
He added : &ldquo; Having , however , considered the relevant material I take the view that a slightly wider approach is called for and I should also take into account what took place shortly before and in antici<l>pation of the hearing ... &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #14:1>
Sir Michael Marshall , Mr Wal<l>lace 's MP , told the House during a short debate that the MoD must have known that the appeal board had been &ldquo; nobbled &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #15:1>
&ldquo; Why did they not speak out ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #16:1>
They could have ended the injustice a long time ago and they could have prevented ministers unintentionally mislead<l>ing this House .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #17:1>
Why did senior of<l>ficials who had worked with Mr Wallace at Northern Ireland speak out when ministers were put in the position of giving a less than full account ? &rdquo;

But Mr Hamilton said : &ldquo; The passage of time since Mr Wallace left the MoD in 1975 was a key ele<l>ment of the failure of the depart<l>mental collective memory which caused ministers to be given inac<l>curate information . &rdquo;

Pay-offs for dockworkers &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #20:2>
400% above original cost &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #21:2>
By Colin Hughes Whitehall Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #22:2>
THE COST of compensating dockers made compulsorily re<l>dundant by the Government 's ab<l>olition of the Dock Labour Scheme is likely to be more than five times the Department of Transport 's original estimate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #23:2>
National Audit Office accounts published today say that , when the 1989 Dock Work Act was pre<l>sented as a Bill to Parliament , MPs were told that it would prob<l>ably lead to 1,500 to 2,000 redun<l>dancies , costing the taxpayer about &pound-sign;25m .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #24:2>
The Act was introduced to end restrictive practices in the docks , under which companies were obliged to use permanently em<l>ployed registered dockers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #25:2>
It en<l>abled employers to make dockers compulsorily redundant for the first time , thus streamlining port operations and cutting costs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #26:2>
The Government , under the Act , agreed to pay half the costs of compensating compulsorily laid<l->off dockers , with employers mak<l>ing up the rest , so long as the dockers were made redundant within three years of the Act being passed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #27:2>
Where a company went bust , however , the Government agreed to pay all the compensa<l>tion costs to redundant workers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #28:2>
In fact , within 10 weeks of the Act coming into force , some 40 per cent of registered dock work<l>ers - 3,756 men - were made re<l>dundant .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #29:2>
The Department of Transport , having estimated that 1989/90 spending on compensa<l>tion would be &pound-sign;10m , had to in<l>crease its estimate to &pound-sign;90m imme<l>diately the Act was passed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #30:2>
By June this year , the number of redundancies had climbed to 4,840 dockers - more than half the former registered work-force .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #31:2>
&ldquo; Further expenditure now ex<l>pected in later years means that the total compensation costs could reach &pound-sign;135m before the compensation scheme ends in 1992 , &rdquo; the auditors say .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #32:2>
The Department of Transport told the auditors that &ldquo; the short time between publication of the Bill and its enactment gave them little time to carry out research on the likely effect of the legislation &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #33:2>
One objection made by the Op<l>position was the haste with which the Government went ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #34:2>
The department believes that Parliament was given the best esti<l>mate it could reasonably make at the time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #35:2>
Officials told the audi<l>tors they were &ldquo; satisfied that Par<l>liament 's attention had been suffi<l>ciently drawn to the uncertainty of the estimate of costs &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #36:2>
They added that the dock strike , which began a week after the Act came into force , exacer<l>bated the spate of redundancies because employers took the opportunity to trim their work<l>forces more sharply .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #37:2>
It is also thought that some dockers opted for redundancy rather than join the strike .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #38:2>
However , the auditors point out that the Transport Department 's original estimates of expected re<l>dundancies took no account of the lay-offs likely to result from com<l>pany liquidations -
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #39:2>
nearly 1,000 registered dockers were made re<l>dundant because 13 dock employ<l>ers fell insolvent , leading to &pound-sign;30m being paid out in full compensa<l>tion .

Lockerbie lawyers say timing of TV report &lsquo; suspicious &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #42:3>
By James Cusick Scotland Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #43:3>
THE TIMING of an American television report that the United States Drug Enforcement Agency is investigating an undercover op<l>eration that may have been used to smuggle a bomb on to Pan Am flight 103 destroyed over Lockerbie , was described yester<l>day as very suspicious by a senior American attorney at the inquiry in Dumfries .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #44:3>
Lee Kreindler , one of the 10 lawyers representing the Ameri<l>can Relatives Group , said that the inquiry had highlighted &ldquo; insuffi<l>ciencies and inadequacies &rdquo; in Pan Am 's security systems .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #45:3>
&ldquo; It is possi<l>ble that someone is trying to change the focus of attention here , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #46:3>
Eighty volumes of evidence , which include more than 1,000 de<l>positions , have been gathered by the American attorneys in their law suit against Pan Am .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #47:3>
The suit alleges wilful misconduct by Pan Am in allowing the bomb to be placed aboard flight 103 , which led to 270 people being killed on 21 December 1988 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #48:3>
Mr Kreindler described the lat<l>est report , aired on network tele<l>vision by NBC , as &ldquo; reminiscent of what happened a year ago &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #49:3>
Last November , a report al<l>leged that the US Central Intelli<l>gence Agency had been monitor<l>ing a terrorist drug-running operation which operated out of Frankfurt in Germany .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #50:3>
Bomb warnings and drugs courier bag<l>gage were mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #51:3>
The new NBC material claims that the terrorists who destroyed flight 103 had learned of a Drug Enforcement Agency operation that allowed suitcases of heroin to pass through Frankfurt airport se<l>curity unchecked .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #52:3>
The focus of the new agency re<l>view is said to be Khalid Jafaar , a 21-year-old Lebanese American student from Detriot Detroit , who died in the disaster .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #53:3>
It is claimed he may have been tricked into carrying the bomb on board .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #54:3>
Commenting on the timing of the two reports , Mr Kreindler said that they had surfaced just as his group were gathering critical evi<l>dence .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #55:3>
&ldquo; We were suspicious a year ago , just as we were gathering ma<l>terial in Frankfurt .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #56:3>
And we are suspicious again . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #57:3>
Mr Kreindler added : &ldquo; There is no doubt the DEA is looking into something , as they would do at any time if evidence was presented to them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #58:3>
But what we are getting is a repeat of information that was known immediately after the bombing , and repeated last year . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #59:3>
If the new material were shown to be true , it would effectively re<l>move legal responsibility for what happened from Pan Am , he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #60:3>
Describing the effect of the NBC report on relatives , he said : &ldquo; The substance is very upsetting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #61:3>
There is the concept that some<l>how the American government were involved in what happened , and that is upsetting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #62:3>
But we have been given no hard evidence any of this is true . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #63:3>
With the Dumfries inquiry mov<l>ing into its second month , Mr Kreindler said that there was nothing his group could do .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #64:3>
&ldquo; We will have to wait and see if there is any substance to any of this .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #65:3>
&ldquo; Meanwhile our work at the in<l>quiry will continue .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #66:3>
What has come out so far has been very im<l>portant to us .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #67:3>
We have been given new information into areas of cau<l>sation , and we will be able to du<l>plicate this evidence in our claim . &rdquo;

Home Office ready to consider code on rights of prisoners
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #69:4>
By Heather Mills Home Affairs Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #70:4>
THE HOME OFFICE is to con<l>sider a package of reforms which would vastly improve the rights of prisoners .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #71:4>
They include the intro<l>duction of a code of minimum standards and a change in griev<l>ance and disciplinary procedures .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #72:4>
The Prison Department 's ac<l>ceptance of the need for reform emerged during the final stages of Lord Justice Woolf 's inquiry into this year 's disturbances at Strangeways and other prisons .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #73:4>
Senior officials told the inquiry that the time was right to imple<l>ment changes which have long been demanded by reformers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #74:4>
Their comments were described by Harry Fletcher , assistant gen<l>eral secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers , as &ldquo; the most encouraging batch of statements to come out of the prison department in decades &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #75:4>
A code of standards would aim to end &ldquo; slopping out &rdquo; by provid<l>ing proper sanitation and guaran<l>tee inmates more frequent show<l>ers and exercise , a daily change of clothes , more space in cells and the opportunity for a full day 's work or recreation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #76:4>
The department is also likely to look at ending the dual role of the Prison Board of Visitors , who act as prison watchdogs as well as ful<l>filling a disciplinary role against prisoners who breach rules .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #77:4>
Consideration is to be given to setting up an independent tribu<l>nal to hear disciplinary offences , allowing the Board of Visitors to ensure standards and treatment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #78:4>
Prisoners may have more faith in such an independent grievance procedure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #79:4>
Ian Dunbar , the director of in<l>mate administration , said the Home Office had deferred an ear<l>lier decision to introduce a griev<l>ance procedure because it would cost about &pound-sign;2m a year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #80:4>
But the inquiry was told this would be a small expense if a sat<l>isfactory process of dealing with complaints and discipline reduced the risk of serious disorder , which at Strangeways alone cost &pound-sign;60m in structural damage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #81:4>
Yesterday , during final public submissions to Lord Justice Woolf , Mr Dunbar said that 1982 proposals for a minimum code had been shelved because at that stage , with poor facilities and overcrowding , it would have proved unworkable .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #82:4>
Instead it had been decided to try to improve conditions and re<l>gimes for prisoners by building new jails and by management reorganisation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #83:4>
Now , with the number of prisoners falling , he agreed the time was right to dis<l>cuss the issue again .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #84:4>
But he said that , initially at least , such standards would not be legally enforceable and would be rules for management rather than rights for prisoners .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #85:4>
Some prisons would be able to guarantee rights quicker than others &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #86:4>
the larger Victorian remand prisons , where overcrowding remained a problem , would not be able to guaran<l>tee such standards so quickly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #87:4>
The Prison Department 's stance is likely to encourage Lord Justice Woolf to include proposals for minimum standards when he finally produces his report , ex<l>pected early next year .

Drug barons threaten to kill hostages
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #89:5>
From Timothy Ross in Bogota
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #90:5>
A HARSH and threatening com<l>muniqu&eacute; from Colombia 's co<l>caine gangsters has heightened fears for the lives of seven kid<l>napped journalists , just when communications seemed to be in place for negotiations between the traffickers and the government .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #91:5>
The communiqu&eacute; warns that the reporters will be executed im<l>mediately if the police capture any of the traffickers ' families to ex<l>change for the hostages &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #92:5>
it also promises to murder relatives of police officers and politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #93:5>
A colleague of Francisco San<l>tos , news editor of the daily El Tiempo , seized on 19 September , commented : :  This looks very bad , very dangerous for the hostages . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #94:5>
The other six include Diana Turbay , daughter of a former Co<l>lombian president , who edits a leading news magazine .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #95:5>
The journalists are only a few of dozens of recent kidnap cases - police statistics show 1,000 kidnappings so far this year - in<l>cluding a businessman , rich cof<l>fee growers and even the manager of a top football team &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #96:5>
all are ap<l>parently being stockpiled by &ldquo; The Extraditables &rdquo; as trading chips in their attempt to force the govern<l>ment to bargain .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #97:5>
Their efforts are now aimed at taking a measure of power through the voting for a Constitu<l>tional Assembly on 9 December , to reform the basis of Colombia 's legal and political system .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #98:5>
The gangsters are manoeuvring for a majority that will categorise drug trafficking as a political offence - equating narco-terrorism with guerrilla violence for the pur<l>poses of a free pardon - and that will outlaw extradition and con<l>fiscation of profits and other as<l>sets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #99:5>
If they succeed , the Colom<l>bian attempt at reform will back<l>fire and convert this nation into a bandit 's paradise .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #100:5>
Letters captured in recent raids show that the group is organising votes to get Juan Gomez Marti<l>nez , a former mayor of Medellin , elected to the assembly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-001 #101:5>
Mr Go<l>mez has offered to act as an inter<l>mediary between the traffickers and the government .

Heads challenge MacGregor on curriculum
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #2:1>
by Caroline Lees
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #3:1>
HEAD TEACHERS are plan<l>ning to challenge a key part of the government 's education reforms by opting out of the national curriculum which lays down what children should learn .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #4:1>
They say it is bureaucratic and inflexible .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #5:1>
John McIntosh , a member of the government-appointed body set up to introduce the curriculum , will be one of the first head teachers to ask John MacGregor , the education sec<l>retary , for permission to aban<l>don parts of it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #6:1>
McIntosh , the principal of London Oratory school , which has opted out of local authority control , has condemned the &ldquo; overcrowd<l>ing &rdquo; of the school timetable with too many subjects .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #7:1>
He said bright pupils would be prevented from fulfilling their potential .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #8:1>
&ldquo; I resent moves to stop pro<l>fessional , experienced teach<l>ers from choosing what is right for the children . &rdquo; said McIn<l>tosh , who was selected by MacGre<l>gor as a member of the Nat<l>ional Curriculum Council .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #9:1>
&ldquo; We decided to opt out to give our pupils and parents more choice in education , but now we are tied to the national curriculum , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #10:1>
He will write to MacGregor next week asking him to in<l>voke section 17 , a clause in the Education Reform Act which could allow pupils to be ex<l>cluded from following the curriculum .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #11:1>
London Oratory , which has 1,100 pupils , is re<l>garded as one of the country 's leading comprehensives .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #12:1>
Secondary school heads are concerned about proposals for the latest stage of the national curriculum , which would le<l>gally require state school stu<l>dents to study 10 subjects plus religious education from the age of 14 to 16 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #13:1>
Next week the National Association of Head Teachers and the Secondary Heads ' Association will meet and ask MacGregor to delay this stage of the curriculum to find a way of offering pupils more choice .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #14:1>
At the same time , the NCC will send its recommendations for 14 to 16-year-olds to MacGregor for approval .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #15:1>
Many head teachers believe the national curriculum , in<l>troduced by the government two years ago to improve stan<l>dards , has become too pre<l>scriptive .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #16:1>
Roger Dancey , the headmaster of King Edward VI Camp Hill , a boys ' gram<l>mar school in Birmingham , said it stifled choice for par<l>ents who wanted to decide the academic future of their children .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #17:1>
&ldquo; It will not allow children to specialise , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #18:1>
&ldquo; If pupils spend all their time studying the 10 subjects set by the gov<l>ernment they will have no time for other options like a second language , or computer studies . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #19:1>
Andrew Caves , 13 , a sec<l>ond-year pupil at the school , already follows the four core subjects taught in all state schools : maths , science , Eng<l>lish and technology .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #20:1>
By the time he is 16 , Andrew expects to be following most of the national curriculum but is concerned that the timetable will leave no time for his favourite subject , computing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #21:1>
&ldquo; I would have to do a little bit of everything except the lessons I want , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #22:1>
&ldquo; At the moment I 'm doing Latin which I love but I would prob<l>ably have to give that up as well . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #23:1>
His mother , Stella Caves , said she hoped Andrew would not have to drop the subjects he liked .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #24:1>
&ldquo; He is so keen on computers and we would like him to keep up those studies because it could be what he chooses as a career , &rdquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #25:1>
Other teachers believe the proposals will harm the pros<l>pects of those who want to specialise in traditional sci<l>ence subjects .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #26:1>
Derek Lee , the headmaster of Kings School , Isaac Newton 's old school in Grantham , Lincs , is con<l>cerned that chemistry , biology and physics will be merged into one science syllabus .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #27:1>
Lee , who will also seek exemption from some curricu<l>lum subjects , said : &ldquo; If we con<l>tinue to undermine the sci<l>ences at GCSE level , fewer youngsters will go on to A<l->level and we will destroy the seeds of our future scientists . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #28:1>
The latest controversy over the national curriculum comes as the NCC is consid<l>ering the results of a study into the working of the curriculum in 2,500 state schools .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #29:1>
Vivian Anthony , the sec<l>retary of Headmasters ' Con<l>ference , which represents in<l>dependent school head<l>masters , said that although independent schools were not obliged to follow the national curriculum , he supported moves by state school heads for greater flexibility .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #30:1>
He said : &ldquo; Studying 10 sub<l>jects at age 16 is a good idea &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #31:1>
the question is , which 10 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #32:1>
There should be more choice . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #33:2>
The children who know only war and starvation
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #34:2>
Africa is again falling victim to a cycle of tragedy , with drought and famine threatening a heavy toll in Sudan , Ethiopia and Mozambique .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #35:2>
Angola , torn by civil war , has also become a land of hunger and death .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #36:2>
In an exclusive report after flying over rebel-held territory to Ganda , a town left without hope , ANDREW HOGG reveals hidden tragedy
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #37:2>
THEIR eyes are vacant , their expressions resigned and they show scant interest in any<l>thing around them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #38:2>
These are the children of Ganda , a small town in war-ravaged southern Angola .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #39:2>
They have become accustomed to life without hope .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #40:2>
Many have lost one parent , some both , in the 15 years of civil war that have brought Angola , potentially one of the richest countries in Africa , to its knees .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #41:2>
Today they face a further threat to their survival : starvation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #42:2>
Ganda , like most of southern Angola , is in the grip of famine , the bellies of its children swollen with kwash<l>iorkor , an advanced stage of malnutrition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #43:2>
In outlying ar<l>eas , it is worse .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #44:2>
Thousands suffer from marasmus , hunger 's most acute form , which wastes the bodies of its victims to virtual skeletons and gives their faces an ethereal look , as though they are clinging to life by a thread .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #45:2>
Outside a local orphanage , a remnant of the colonial era with peeling paint and empty rooms , a child dressed in rags , his belly grotesquely dis<l>tended , tugs at visitors ' trou<l>sers , desperately miming the act of eating .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #46:2>
Foreigners repre<l>sent hope :
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #47:2>
some Western relief workers have recently got through to this ravaged area , but their supplies have not been enough .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #48:2>
Most of the children are too apathetic to move as they await their mea<l>gre handouts &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #49:2>
many are so weak they cannot even brush flies away from their faces .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #50:2>
&ldquo; We have some rice and cassava , but that is running out fast .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #51:2>
Everyone is hungry , &rdquo; said Florenda Maria , an 18-year-old orphanage worker .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #52:2>
&ldquo; Without help , many will die . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #53:2>
The children in her care had little enough as it was , but last month their chances of sur<l>vival were reduced further when the rebel forces of Unita attacked Ganda to mark the anniversary of the birth of Agostinho Neto , the late founder of the regime they op<l>pose .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #54:2>
What they could not steal , they destroyed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #55:2>
Municipal offices were gut<l>ted and the home of the local commissioner reduced to rub<l>ble .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #56:2>
Shops were plundered , two generators wrecked , and a 55,000-gallon water-storage tower blown up .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #57:2>
Today , Ganda is an eerie sight , its tree-lined boulevards of neat bungalows laid out by the Portuguese , the country 's former colonial masters , all but deserted .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #58:2>
The orphanage still stands , but its status as a haven for small children did not prevent it from being ran<l>sacked .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #59:2>
Unita troops stole everything they could carry , from food to furniture .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #60:2>
A young teenage boy was ab<l>ducted to help remove the spoils , and the rest left to fend for themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #61:2>
The rooms are now bare of everything but bed frames &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #62:2>
women squat on floors to tend children .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #63:2>
Most adults appeared still to be in a state of shock , their descrip<l>tions of the night Unita came largely monosyllabic .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #64:2>
Florenda Maria is now a local heroine .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #65:2>
As the older children fled into the darkness for safety , she risked her life to stay and look after five babies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #66:2>
&ldquo; My life was in the balance , &rdquo; she recalled .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #67:2>
&ldquo; When the sol<l>diers found me , they de<l>manded food .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #68:2>
They had already removed all the clothes , blankets and mat<l>tresses .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #69:2>
We look after 60 child<l>ren here , but they stripped the stores , leaving just two bags of rice . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #70:2>
Nobody knows for certain how many have died of hun<l>ger in southern Angola .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #71:2>
The risks are too great for anyone to venture into the bush to monitor what is happening .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #72:2>
Estimates , however , point to a catastrophe .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #73:2>
Rains have failed for four years and , says the United Nations , 1.9m people are on the brink of starvation in the nine provinces where fighting has been fiercest and drought most severe .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #74:2>
Ganda is a vivid example of how the famine is feeding off a war the world has largely forgotten .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #75:2>
Both the rebels and government forces have de<l>stroyed villages , command<l>eering what food they can find , and both sides have a history of press-ganging re<l>cruits , snatching men and younger women .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #76:2>
Their indiscriminate scat<l>tering of land mines has caused further agony .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #77:2>
Angola is said by Africa Watch , the human rights group , to have suffered the highest number of civilian land-mine casualties in the world - up to 50,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #78:2>
Amputees are common .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #79:2>
In recent weeks it rained in some areas , but there are no seeds left to plant .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #80:2>
Relief workers know that if they bring in fresh seeds , they must bring in food too , otherwise the seeds will simply be eaten .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #81:2>
Ganda , like other govern<l>ment-held towns , has been in<l>undated with refugees from the countryside .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #82:2>
Joaquim Silva , a 73-year-old farmer , told a familiar story : &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #83:2>
We came to the town because we couldn't stay in our village .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #84:2>
Unita had stolen all our cattle and belongings .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #85:2>
We started farming here , but now Unita has stolen our farming im<l>plements and taken all the food we had . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #86:2>
Getting aid through , how<l>ever , is a nightmare .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #87:2>
While the government holds the towns , Unita controls much of the countryside , its troops equipped with American-sup<l>plied ground-to-air missiles to deter air transport .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #88:2>
A visit in<l>volves a 50-minute treetop<l->hugging flight in a military helicopter from a government airfield at Benguela &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #89:2>
low alti<l>tude flying minimises the time Unita has to react .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #90:2>
A further complication in supplying aid is the bureau<l>cracy of the Angolan govern<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #91:2>
This was enlarged to frightening proportions by the central planning beloved by the once-fervent Marxists .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #92:2>
At the town of Cubal , close to Ganda , a nutritional centre run by the Catholic church handles the worst cases .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #93:2>
Re<l>cently a child was found suck<l>ling at the breast of its dead mother , who had starved to death .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #94:2>
Despite supplies from agencies such as Oxfam and the Catholic Relief Services , as well as the Angolan govern<l>ment , the centre fights a con<l>stant battle .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #95:2>
None the less , it constitutes a sanctuary that occasionally helps more than 1,000 re<l>fugees .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #96:2>
Those who make it , how<l>ever , represent a fraction of the number who starve to death in the bush .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #97:2>
This week , for the first time since the war began , lorries loaded with international aid will set out to the worst-hit regions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #98:2>
The $80m relief effort is being coordinated by the United Nations after guar<l>antees from the government and Unita that the convoys will not be attacked .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #99:2>
Such assurances are un<l>precedented , allowing plans to move in 120,000 tonnes of food , seeds , implements , clothing , blankets and medical supplies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #100:2>
For some , however , the aid will come too late .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #101:2>
The authorities in Benguela es<l>timate that more than 10,000 starved to death in the 10 months up to last July .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #102:2>
There is , however , opti<l>mism that the civil war may soon be at an end .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #103:2>
Peace talks in Lisbon are said to be progressing , and there is talk of a cease-fire before Christ<l>mas .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #104:2>
President Jos&eacute; Eduardo dos Santos , the Angolan lead<l>er , has little option but to pur<l>sue peace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #105:2>
His troops have been unable to defeat Unita , the economy is in ruins and his former supporters , the Soviet Union and Cuba , are abandoning him .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #106:2>
Jonas Savimbi , the head of Unita , is also under pressure to agree to a cease-fire .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #107:2>
Last week , Congress in Washington agreed that military aid to Unita - $60m for the coming year - would be suspended once the Angolan government agrees to a cease-fire , a reason<l>able timetable for free elec<l>tions , the withdrawal of Soviet and other military advisers and an end to military offensives .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #108:2>
A political settlement be<l>tween the warring factions would allow Angola to re<l>build its ravaged economy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-002 #109:2>
The scars inflicted on its people will take longer to heal , however , even with the imminent arrival of food aid .

When Tory jaw-jaw turns to war-war
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #3:1>
Commentary By Hugo Young
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #4:1>
THE Falklands war saved Mrs Thatcher in 1982 , and she went on to leave her mark on history .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #5:1>
A Gulf war may well save her in 1990 , but the further outcome of that is less promising .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #6:1>
If it happens in the next month , it will probably ensure that she does not face a leadership challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #7:1>
As a result of such an enforced preservation of their leader , however , the Conservatives would face the next election , as more and more of them now think , at a disadvantage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #8:1>
They are caught in a deep bind .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #9:1>
War is an increasing factor in all political calculations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #10:1>
Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation swept it from most front pages at just the time when many strategists are shortening the odds against it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #11:1>
There is a heavy chance that it will happen soon .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #12:1>
President Bush 's scheduled Gulf visit on November 22 does not make it any easier for Tories to nominate themselves for a contest beginning on November 29 and perhaps running through early December .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #13:1>
It seems to be agreed that the slightest possibility of body-bags coming home will deter all contestants .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #14:1>
And yet a challenge to Mrs Thatcher seems quite widely agreed to be necessary , and therefore likely .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #15:1>
In this kind of politics , uncertainty reigns .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #16:1>
Politicians are obliged to sound like men who have got it all worked out , but in truth they have not .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #17:1>
All the present actors live day to day in a frenzy of uncertainty , chiefly dependent for its resolution on the unanswerable question of what the other guy intends to do .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #18:1>
But let us assume that the momentum for a contest continues unabated .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #19:1>
What are the chances of it achieving its objective ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #20:1>
Inescapably the main player is Michael Heseltine .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #21:1>
His portentous weekend letter makes that clear enough .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #22:1>
He is the other magnetic point in the party , at the opposite pole from the leader .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #23:1>
He cannot continue for ever willing to wound but afraid to strike .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #24:1>
Such continual prevarication is already causing some to question his masculinity , a painful point in the age of macho politics .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #25:1>
Having fallen completely from view since May , he finds another window suddenly beckoning .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #26:1>
His letter shows half a willingness to go for it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #27:1>
But only half .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #28:1>
Mr Heseltine is a man caught in as tight a corner as the leader he wants to displace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #29:1>
He knows he will have only one chance , and he knows two other things .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #30:1>
First , he cannot stand against the leader unless he is fairly sure of a victory that nobody can honestly predict .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #31:1>
But second , and more important : should the Tories lose the next election under Mrs Thatcher , he will be damned and written out of the succession if he is seen to be even marginally responsible for her proving to be unelectable .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #32:1>
His actions this weekend may already have put him in that category .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #33:1>
If that is so , it could be an argument for running now .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #34:1>
Perhaps he has burned his boats , preparatory to a final conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #35:1>
I do not think that is the way he will see it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #36:1>
What Heseltine most desperately hopes for is that Howe will yet be prevailed on to run , in which case the field would by general consent be opened to all-comers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #37:1>
And why , after all , did this quiescent and calculating man , lifetime member of the Micawber society , resign from the Cabinet if not to achieve a serious result ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #38:1>
Geoffrey Howe remains the unplayed joker .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #39:1>
But other problems face Heseltine , which outsiders may see more clearly than he does .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #40:1>
The decisive problem is that he fails the test of leadership he himself posed at the weekend .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #41:1>
He called for a healer , a reconciler , a man who could forge all sectors of the party into some kind of electable whole .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #42:1>
His own ideas , and perhaps also his own temperament , render him a singularly uncovincing unconvincing personification of this beau ideal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #43:1>
He certainly has the charisma .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #44:1>
If the issue arose over something other than Europe , it would be possible to imagine the Conservative Party swallowing its differences and deciding that his galvanic presence was the likeliest guarantor of an election victory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #45:1>
And over Europe he would not , of course , create a Thatcherite turmoil inside the European Community .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #46:1>
The long march from summit to summit , spitting fury , which has become as embarrassing as it is futile to many voters , would cease .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #47:1>
But his own position is well known .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #48:1>
Although mouthing anti-federalist words , he is squarely in the school of operators , justly identified by Ian Aitken in this space yesterday , who have carried Britain onwards into Europe , partly by means of subterfuge as to their own intentions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #49:1>
A core of Tory ultras will fight to stop this happening again .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #50:1>
A much larger group , I guess , would doubt Heseltine 's ability to be anything like the leader he has defined as necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #51:1>
If this was not obstacle enough , it is redoubled by the presence of another man who more closely fits the bill .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #52:1>
If there is to be another leader , with a healing disposition , Douglas Hurd is showing himself day by day to be the obvious candidate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #53:1>
His poise , authority , and reputation for wisdom survived even the humiliations he suffered in Israel last month , which were enough to have sunk a lesser man .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #54:1>
With Hurd in the wings , why should anyone vote to give Heseltine his self-appointed task even if Hurd , for obvious reasons , cannot in present circumstances be regarded as a candidate ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #55:1>
All this suggests that Heseltine will not run and may , even now , be in the process of diminishing his assets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #56:1>
He was lured from cover and , short of Howe acting more aggressively than he has ever done in his life , may already be winged .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #57:1>
This will damage him even if a different scenario now unfolds .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #58:1>
As its main actor such a scenario would have another stalking-horse , of better pedigree than Sir A. Meyer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #59:1>
The Thatcher circle spent part of the weekend preparing for one ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #60:1>
such is their awareness of the foaming discontent in the ranks .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #61:1>
The terms of trade have changed since last year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #62:1>
To have an impact , such a candidate would need to get considerably more than 60 people behind him .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #63:1>
The candidate , being bigger than Meyer , would have to cross a higher threshold of electoral credibility &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #64:1>
and given the lapse of time , as well as a year 's accretion of known rebels and malcontents , it will be easier for the incumbent to discount any figure below about 80 as beneath contempt .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #65:1>
But the possibility of exceeding that figure is serious .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #66:1>
If 100 or more MPs either voted against Mrs Thatcher or declined to support her , less than a year before the preferred election date , she would be in the direst straits .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #67:1>
Far more than that number , I judge , now believe that they would have a better chance of holding their seats and keeping power under another leader .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #68:1>
This includes the majority of the Cabinet .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #69:1>
But they will not act unless the party as a whole makes its message quite unmistakable .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #70:1>
Arguably even then - 100 votes against - they would find reasons not to do so : not , in other words , to deploy the magic circle which , although no longer empowered to nominate the Tory leader , retains the power to invite her honourably to depart .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #71:1>
But it is the likeliest beginning of the end .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #72:1>
Which is why a number of people who matter have reason to be reflecting with relief , as well as grim sagacity , on the inevitability of war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #X73:2>

<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #74:2>
Will the trigger pull the finger in the Gulf ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #75:2>
Norman F. Dixon analyses the factors , like boredom and cognitive dissonance , that may lead to war -
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #76:2>
that can engulf mankind
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #77:2>
By Norman F Dixon
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #78:2>
WERE it not for the barrage balloons , went the second world war joke , the sheer weight of American forces gathered in Britain would have pushed us below the sea .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #79:2>
This build-up of allied strength happened quite a long time into the war :
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #80:2>
it determined the outcome , not the outbreak , of hostilities .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #81:2>
But what if a massive build-up of armed strength occurs before a war has started ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #82:2>
What are the chances of it being used ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #83:2>
Does it increase or decrease the likelihood of armed conflict ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #84:2>
Does the sheer accumulation of military hardware in Saudi Arabia create a momentum of its own ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #85:2>
Extrapolating from the fact that the colossal build-up of armaments by both sides in the cold war did not lead to hostilities tempts one to assume that the potential for &ldquo; mutual assured destruction &rdquo; , now existing in the Middle East , would deter either side from starting a fight .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #86:2>
Quite apart from the painful lessons of Korea and Vietnam , the fearful destruction and immense loss of life that would ensue , the threat of escalation from traditional to chemical , bacterial , and eventually global nuclear war would surely restrain anyone from unleashing such a conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #87:2>
Then there are the people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #88:2>
Up to the Vietnam war , the role of public opinion in determining warring behaviour was relatively slight &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #89:2>
but now , as America learned to its cost in Vietnam , vivid TV coverage of battlefield events and of bodies being brought home could have a remarkably restraining influence on even the most gung-ho generals and bellicose politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #90:2>
Such considerations militate against momentum theory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #91:2>
Unfortunately there remain some strong if not stronger arguments in favour of the opposite view : that an excessive show of force inevitably leads to war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #92:2>
The full pressure of public opinion is unlikely to be felt until after a war has begun &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #93:2>
and the greater the build-up , the larger the number of people and weapons involved , and the bigger the chances of war starting by accident .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #94:2>
In fact , in at least two non-mutually exclusive ways a chance occurrence - like an accidental over-flying of enemy territory - could precipitate war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #95:2>
In a cold war climate the fail-safe survival response of either side would be to assume the worst and immediately retaliate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #96:2>
This is what happened in 1983 when a Korean 747 accidentally entered Russian air space : it was shot down .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #97:2>
The immediate response of some senior American officers was to start planning a retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union , which another officer believed &ldquo; could have started the third world war &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #98:2>
When emotions are running high , even the most innocent of errors may call forth murderous levels of selfrighteous indignation , particularly among hawkish factions who are longing for an excuse to justify their existence .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #99:2>
But there are even bigger pressures towards using what you have got .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #100:2>
The old saying applied to brains , sexual performance , and diesel engines , &ldquo; If you don't use it , you 'll lose it , &rdquo; - ie , they also deteriorate when not being used - is relevant to military behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #101:2>
A feared loss of the ability to fight , with constant failure to achieve much-publicised goals , are powerful incentives to have a go , especially when fuelled - as in this case - by boredom and cognitive dissonance , that uncomfortable feeling when subsequent events conflict with a decision already made .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #102:2>
A common feature of cold/phoney wars is that they sap morale through boredom , particularly when the &ldquo; waiting game &rdquo; is played out far from home in an environment rendered uncongenial - as in this case - by such irritants as intense heat , fine sand , and local attitudes towards wine and women , which interfere with these traditional compensations for a soldier 's lot .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #103:2>
The urge to reduce boredom by starting a fight may well be resisted by the risks involved , but the snag is that the very wealth of equipment , including protection against chemical weapons , could diminish the sense of risk .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #104:2>
As proponents of risk homeostasis theory have pointed out , any reduction of risk - for example , by having safety belts and better brakes - is invariably consumed by a proportionate increase in risky behaviour .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #105:2>
Louis XIV , it has been said , used to start a war whenever he felt bored , and we seem to need a bit of risk to reduce ennui .
<ICE-GB:W2C-003 #106:2>
But the decision to open fire is usually taken by some politician far enough from the firing line to state an immediate sense of risk .

Karpov slips up
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #4:1>
By Leonard Barden
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #5:1>
ANATOLY KARPOV overlooked a won ending in game eight of the world championship in New York and missed his chance to go ahead of Gary Kasparov , the defending champion , for the first time in their 24-game match .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #6:1>
A draw was finally agreed after a 10-hour marathon of 84 moves , the second-longest game to be played by these rivals in 128 title encounters .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #7:1>
Yesterday they went into game nine with the scores locked at 4-4 after a win apiece and six draws .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #8:1>
The critical moment of the eighth game came at move 53 , when Karpov had only a minute to make four moves before the time control .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #9:1>
He blundered , and squandered the extra pawn and superior position gained at the end of the first session .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #10:1>
Experts had expected Kasparov to succumb to Karpov 's renowned endgame technique , but he posed enough problems to secure a draw .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #11:1>
Their antagonism thawed as they remained on stage for an animated post-mortem .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #12:1>
When they returned for the ninth game Kasparov , playing black , dropped the King 's Indian Defence for the first time in the series and switched to the Grunfeld , his preference in earlier series with Karpov .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #13:1>
Karpov had his own surprise ready , a simple central pawn exchange which he had not used previously .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #14:1>
Kasparov immediately forced the exchange of queens , apparently ready to settle for a draw .

Manchester United 3 , Liverpool 1

United expose Liverpool rearguard
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #19:2>
By David Lacey
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #20:2>
LIVERPOOL were rumbled in the Rumbelows Cup last night , to Old Trafford 's immense satisfaction .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #21:2>
Manchester United , the FA Cup holders , beat the League champions in a manner which suggested that the First Division may yet be more open than it looks .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #22:2>
United will visit Arsenal , comfortable winners at Manchester City on Tuesday , in the fourth round at the end of the month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #23:2>
Football does have a delightful way of serving up ironies :
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #24:2>
it is only 11 days since the players of United and Arsenal became embroiled in the melee at Old Trafford which has led to the clubs facing charges of bringing the game into disrepute .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #25:2>
By the time they meet at Highbury they should know their punishment , although the FA may now consider postponing the hearing to give the teams a chance to show they can keep the peace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #26:2>
Last night 's defeat was Liverpool 's first in 14 League , cup and Charity Shield matches this season and their first since losing to Crystal Palace in last season 's FA Cup semi-finals .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #27:2>
Last night 's performance , moreover , had strong echoes of that memorable Sunday afternoon at Villa Park &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #28:2>
again Liverpool 's defence was vulnerable in the air and again serious questions had to be asked about Grobbelaar 's goalkeeping .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #29:2>
For United the win over their most bitter rivals could hardly have been better timed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #30:2>
In mid-September they had lost 4-0 at Anfield , and already their hopes of offering a serious challenge to Liverpool in the League were beginning to drift .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #31:2>
But Saturday 's recovery at Maine Road , where they forced a draw after being 3-1 down , had clearly put the players in good heart .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #32:2>
With Phelan lending the impressive Ince solid support in midfield and Sharpe consistently pressing the opposition back on the left wing , United quickly established a pattern of command which Liverpool did not seriously challenge until Houghton scored their goal eight minutes from the end .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #33:2>
By then United were 3-0 ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #34:2>
Liverpool were without Barnes , still suffering from a strained hamstring , which meant that they lacked the means to get back into the game once United had scored twice in the space of a minute late in the first half .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #35:2>
But the absence of Whelan from midfield and Hansen in defence was more significant .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #36:2>
All might have been well for Liverpool had Grobbelaar reproduced the form he had shown at Norwich City 11 days earlier when the champions lost their 100 per cent League record .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #37:2>
His saves then enabled Liverpool to force a 1-1 draw when they might well have been beaten .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #38:2>
Last night rather proved the point , though not to Grobbelaar 's satisfaction .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #39:2>
At least the leniency of Joe Worrall spared Liverpool the further ignominy of having a man sent off for a &ldquo; professional foul &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #40:2>
In the 69th minute Wallace broke clear in the Liverpool half and raced towards the penalty area with only Grobbelaar in front of him .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #41:2>
Burrows sprinted across from the left and brought him down about 25 yards from goal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #42:2>
Worrall apparently took the view that Wallace was not sufficiently close to goal to have an obvious scoring opportunity denied him , so Burrows was shown the yellow card instead of the red .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #43:2>
Liverpool 's defence was in trouble from the moment , early in the match , when Grobbelaar , Gillespie and Burrows collided going for a looping shot from McClair .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #44:2>
Burrows eventually cleared the danger but as Grobbelaar saved Blackmore 's shot and Pallister 's header in quick succession a United goal seemed imminent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #45:2>
In fact Old Trafford had to wait another 20 minutes but then two goals arrived together , like buses .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #46:2>
In the 36th minute Grobbelaar completely misjudged Irwin 's high , hanging centre from the right and Nicol handled .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #47:2>
Bruce 's penalty beat Grobbelaar 's dive and Old Trafford roared its ecstasy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #48:2>
Another minute and it was roaring even louder .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #49:2>
Hughes gathered the ball just inside the Liverpool half and strode away from Molby .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #50:2>
Gillespie positioned himself for a challenge but before he could move in for the tackle Hughes had driven the ball high past Grobbelaar from 25 yards .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #51:2>
Hughes had already hurt an ankle and he stayed off after half-time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #52:2>
He went to hospital for an X-ray and misses Saturday 's visit of Crystal Palace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #53:2>
With Rosenthal on for Burrows as an extra attacker , Liverpool strained to salvage something from the tie .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #54:2>
In the 82nd minute Houghton 's shot took a big deflection off Pallister to leave Sealey stranded , but the game ended with McClair putting the ball wide of a gaping net after the Liverpool goalkeeper had failed to hold Blackmore 's free-kick .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #55:2>
The Rumbelows Cup might not have been the biggest of Liverpool 's ambitions but it is still a big earner .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #56:2>
Now Dalglish will be anxious to ensure that last night 's mistakes are not repeated in the First Division at Tottenham on Sunday .

Stephen Bierley sees Newcastle United selling themselves
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #65:3>
By Stephen Bierley
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #66:3>
THE message just outside the Gallowgate End of St James ' Park is enticing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #67:3>
&ldquo; Where the pursuit of excellence inevitably leads you , &rdquo; it reads .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #68:3>
Sadly this refers not to Newcastle United FC but to a particular make of Swedish car .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #69:3>
A cold wind knifed along the Tyne yesterday , rustling autumn leaves along grey streets under grey skies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #70:3>
It was not the sort of morning to raise the spirits , to say nothing of a share issue .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #71:3>
But a brass band played , black and white balloons were tossed menacingly in the direction of Sunderland , and champagne frothed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #72:3>
At a time when Newcastle United lie a miserable 12th in the Second Division and are being financially bled by the interest payments on their new Milburn Stand , the board has launched an &pound-sign;8 million public share issue .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #73:3>
Its aim , according to the club 's chairman Gordon McKeag , is to make United &ldquo; one of the foremost clubs in the country &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #74:3>
There was even animated , dewy-eyed talk of a hurried return to the First Division and startling mention of the &ldquo; rich rewards of Europe &rdquo; , with the footballing folk of Newcastle urged to put their money where their mouths are by John Hall the people 's champion and large shareholder , Mr Magpie and Mr MetroCentre .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #75:3>
&ldquo; If they don't support the club now they will only have themselves to blame in the future , &rdquo; said Hall .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #76:3>
&ldquo; The club can be theirs in a democratic way . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #77:3>
But what price democracy ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #78:3>
Each share will cost &pound-sign;1 but the minimum holding is set at &pound-sign;100 , which is a hefty slice of dole money .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #79:3>
The issue is not being underwritten , so if a minimum subscription of &pound-sign;2.5 million has not been raised by 5 pm on November 30 the offer , which amounts to just over 56 per cent of the total shares , will be withdrawn .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #80:3>
The issue was enthused over by George Forbes , the vice-chairman : &ldquo; It is the key .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #81:3>
If it succeeds it will open the door to a first-class club with first-class facilities . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #82:3>
These are not ordinary shares , of course .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #83:3>
Nothing connected with Newcastle United FC could ever be ordinary .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #84:3>
These are shares to make every true Newcastle fan feel proud , to hug to his or her black and white bosom , shares to cherish on a bleak winter night after a goalless draw against Brighton .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #85:3>
&ldquo; You would not so much be buying a financial proposition as a part of the Tyneside heritage , &rdquo; the directors explain in the prospectus .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #86:3>
Given the almost child-like faith in Hall 's utterances by many supporters , notably the Magpie Group , it is quite possible that the share issue will be fully subscribed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #87:3>
Unfortunately , as has been shown time and again in football , money does not guarantee success .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #88:3>
The feeling persisted yesterday afternoon , long after the champagne had ceased to flow , that the Newcastle board , in the name of either democracy ( Hall ) or heritage ( McKeag ) , is doing little more than trying to get Joe Public to bail it out of a self-inflicted financial mess , with no guarantee that anything is going to get better .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #89:3>
If today 's Geordies are really canny lads they would do well to keep their hands in their pockets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #90:3>
Ask anybody at Tottenham or Millwall .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #91:3>
All told , Kill the board may well remain Newcastle 's favourite line in graffiti , for the time being at least .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #92:3>
&ldquo; Who knows , &rdquo; Hall said yesterday , &ldquo; in the future the new shareholders might vote the board off . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #93:3>
McKeag did not visibly smile .

Cynthia Bateman on the dismissal of the free-spending manager whose 14-year career at Goodison Park came to an abrupt end yesterday
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #97:4>
True-blue Harvey pays for Everton slump
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #98:4>
By Cynthia Bateman
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #99:4>
COLIN HARVEY , the true blue who always said Everton 's interests were more important than his own and who spent about &pound-sign;12 million in pursuit of them , was dismissed yesterday after 14 years at Goodison Park as player , coach and manager .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #100:4>
The embarrassing defeat by Sheffield United in the Rumbelows League Cup on Tuesday , after only one League win this season , forced the board 's hand .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #101:4>
Everton 's chairman Philip Carter , in a brief statement , said of the 46-year-old Harvey : &ldquo; We thank him for his contribution over 14 years , but the team 's recent performance was quite unacceptable . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #102:4>
One of the biggest jobs in British football is to be advertised .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #103:4>
The first-team coach , Jimmy Gabriel will be caretaker until a replacement is found .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #104:4>
Joe Royle , the one-tim Everton centre-forward who has made such a good managerial impression with Oldham , may be tempted by the vacancy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #105:4>
But he has refused offers elsewhere , notably from Manchester City .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #106:4>
Crystal Palace 's manager , the Merseyside-born Steve Coppell , is also high on Everton 's list .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #107:4>
Derby 's Arthur Cox may be a contender , as may John Toshack , in danger at Real Madrid .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #108:4>
Ron Atkinson 's name has also been mentioned .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #109:4>
He is negotiating a two-year contract extension with Sheffield Wednesday but , contrary to reports , has not yet agreed to the deal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #110:4>
Atkinson said yesterday : &ldquo; I 'm happy here . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #111:4>
Asked whether he would accept the Everton job if he were offered it , he replied : &ldquo; I never comment on hypothetical situations . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #112:4>
Everton have had a high regard for the Liverpool-born Harvey , particularly his coaching .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #113:4>
But their 18th place left the board with little option .
<ICE-GB:W2C-004 #114:4>
Harvey felt let down by Tuesday 's result , saying it was &ldquo; very important to everyone , but I didn't feel it hurt certain people enough when we lost &rdquo; .

Yorkshire banks on homely service as it treks south
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #3:1>
Outlook
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #4:1>
By Roger Cowe
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #5:1>
IN AN AGE of specialisation , branding and market segmentation it is curious that everybody in the banking business wants to be the same as everybody else .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #6:1>
Despite its protestations to the contrary , Yorkshire Bank is no different - just smaller .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #7:1>
It is too small to harbour international ambitions or to target huge corporate clients , but domestically it too wants to be on every high street offering every financial service that bankers or insurance people can invent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #8:1>
Yesterday 's results for the nine months to its new year-end suggest this strategy is doing it no harm , despite higher bad debt write-offs ( again , like every other bank ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #9:1>
Pre-tax profits for the nine months reached &pound-sign;92 million , against a full year 's &pound-sign;113 million last time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #10:1>
The Leeds-based bank that began as a savings institution in the middle of the last century has already gone well beyond that base , in much the same way as has the TSB ( although without the disastrous acquisitions which tempted TSB when privatisation money was burning a hole in its pocket ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #11:1>
In the 1970s it began to expand beyond its northern fastness and beyond its personal customer base , successfully attracting new business with free and &ldquo; open all hours &rdquo; banking .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #12:1>
Earlier this year , the four clearing banks which owned it finally decided to cash in their investment , to the delight of National Australia Bank , which had been eyeing the Yorkshire for years .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #13:1>
The change of ownership has made a few differences .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #14:1>
But general manager Graham Sunderland insists the only serious change has been to accelerate the bank 's expansion .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #15:1>
The speed of advance may be greater , but the direction is the same - south .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #16:1>
He joked yesterday that the bank 's South-east region once began at Hunslet ( barely a Yorkshire pudding 's throw from Leeds , for readers not acquainted with that part of the world ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #17:1>
Now he is hoping to open branches in Slough and Enfield , and is even contemplating going south of the Thames .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #18:1>
This is all very well .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #19:1>
Yorkshire Bank has managed its expansion satisfactorily so far , and there is no reason why we poor benighted southerners should not get the benefit of one of the most profitable banks in the Western world ( its low cost/income ratio being a stark reminder that economies of scale are often illusory ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #20:1>
The trouble is , it is difficult to see what will differentiate the bank from the huge number of its competitors on the high streets of Bristol , Slough , Gloucester and points south .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #21:1>
Mr Sunderland 's answer is homely , personal , Yorkshire-style service .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #22:1>
He quotes a new small business customer who had never seen the manager of their previous bank , another who was unceremoniously informed that her loan rate had just gone up by three percentage points , and yet another who abandoned one of the major clearers because it transferred his account from corporate centre in the wilds of Huddersfield , where they allegedly know nothing about steel .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #23:1>
The bank is presumably safe enough in its home county , although there is no guarantee that its former owners will not now start to compete more vigorously in Yorkshire now their former offspring is a clear competitor .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #24:1>
But it is more difficult to believe that the Yorkshire will have any competitive advantage in newer territories where customers will have no loyalty .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #25:1>
Customers may well be attracted now , especially while the major clearers are not in a particularly strong competitive position .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #26:1>
But will they not gaily wave goodbye when the clearers begin to compete aggressively again , with cheap mortgages or other special offers , and when more building societies start piling in to mainstream banking ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #27:1>
It would be nice to believe that they will not .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #28:1>
And it is understandable that the Yorkshire wishes to expand to provide scope for staff to develop within the bank .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #29:1>
But in this fickle consumer society ( which already has more bank and building society branches than it can cope with ) , the Yorkshire would probably stand more chance of retaining its low cost / high profit standing if the South-east once again began at least at Nottingham , if not Hunslet .

Bank governor puts regulation at forefront of debate -

Call for close eye on European banking
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #33:2>
By Mark Milner
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #34:2>
THE governor of the Bank of England , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , yesterday tried to push the issue of banking supervision to the forefront of the European monetary union debate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #35:2>
He made clear that the nature of a future watchdog for the European banking industry within the single market should not be neglected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #36:2>
In an address to French bankers last night Mr Leigh-Pemberton delivered a robust defence of the UK 's evolutionary approach to EMU and British proposals for a &ldquo; hard Ecu &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #37:2>
He told his audience that so far the assumption had been that banking supervision would be left to national regulators - in most cases the national central bank :
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #38:2>
&ldquo; We have to ask ourselves how this might be affected by the EMU debate &semi; whether any supervisory responsibilities could or should be transferred to the centre if ever a Community monetary authority were to be established as part of moves to monetary union . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #39:2>
The question of banking supervision should still be resolved , Mr Leigh-Pemberton said , irrespective of whether or not the Community pressed ahead with monetary union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #40:2>
Though he is keen to see the matter debated , he is clearly in no hurry to see the Bank of England 's supervisory responsibilities passed to a pan-European institution .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #41:2>
His decision to spark a debate may reflect concern that , unless the ground rules are well worked out in advance , a new central bank for Europe with responsibilities for maintaining price stability would almost inevitably seek to widen its authority into the area of banking supervision .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #42:2>
Though Mr Leigh-Pemberton did not rule out a role for such an institution , he argued that the future allocation of responsibilities would have to take account of any market developments .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #43:2>
The new central bank could develop a co-ordinating role between the various national regulators and this might lead to centralisation of supervisory responsibilities :
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #44:2>
&ldquo; It would be quite wrong to do this , however , unless the European banking scene evolved over decades to the point where it had a distinct character separate from that of national systems . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #45:2>
Later in the day the governor underlined his opposition to a dash towards monetary union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #46:2>
He pointed out the lessons of German union where the overall cost and the economic dislocation in East Germany had been higher than expected :
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #47:2>
&ldquo; Rushed monetary union would therefore be likely to create very difficult political issues in the Community , possibly even divisive ones . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #48:2>
He cautioned against those who believe that a central bank with a Bundesbank-style constitution would automatically inherit the German central bank 's credibility :
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #49:2>
&ldquo; The incontrovertible lesson of post-war central banking is that credibility is extremely hard to establish and extremely easy to lose . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #50:2>
He attacked as divisive suggestions that an inner group of countries should embark on fast track monetary union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #51:2>
The proposals for a hard Ecu and a European Monetary Fund were designed to be anti-inflationary and would encourage greater economic convergence .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #52:2>
&ldquo; Our proposed way forward would also avoid the risks , &rdquo; Mr Leigh-Pemberton declared , &ldquo; in making an abrupt jump from a tried and successful Community system - the Exchange Rate Mechanism - to a new and untried central bank responsible for Community monetary policy . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #53:2>
Despite differences over full monetary union , he told his audience , the United Kingdom remained firmly committed to the European single market , the defeat of inflation through the Exchange Rate Mechanism , greater economic convergence and monetary integration .

IN EXPECTATION of interest rate cuts on either side of the Atlantic in a few weeks , shares moved ahead , led by the main index future and government stocks , many of which put on over a quarter point .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #59:3>
But for sterling 's drift , buyers might have been more enthusiastic .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #60:3>
In the big building and engineering sections , fears of profit declines continued to bear down on prices .

BAKING and milling giant Associated British Foods - which is hoping to buy the British Sugar business - turned in a &pound-sign;21 million half-year profits jump yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #64:3>
The figures were at the top of City estimates , but there was some concern that UK trading profits were down &pound-sign;2.8 million , the &pound-sign;1.1 billion cash pile being the money spinner providing nearly half the total surplus .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #65:3>
Heavy competition in a declining bread market hit profits in the bakery division .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #66:3>
Chairman Gerry Weston said prolonged periods of warm weather had hit sales of bread , and this factor had also helped produce &ldquo; a relatively poor sales performance from the company 's retail bakery and light-catering outlets . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #67:3>
City analysts are worried that the profits on the cash mountain will turn down as interest rates fall .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #68:3>
Smith New Court analyst Julian Lakin emphasised the need for its deployment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #69:3>
British Sugar , the only profitable component of troubled commodities group Berisford International , is worth about &pound-sign;1 billio .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #70:3>
Mr Lakin said he thought Associated could probably pick it up for less than that .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #71:3>
Rival takeover plans by sweeteners group Tate &ampersand; Lyle have been packed off to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a competition check .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #72:3>
A merger would give the combined Tate/British Sugar group 95 per cent of the UK market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #73:3>
Turnover rose to &pound-sign;1.367 billion from &pound-sign;1.272 billion last time .

Shareholders get an interim dividend of 3.7p a share , up 0.4p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #78:3>
AFTER the jump in profitability a year ago , Renold , the chain and gears engineer , is labouring again .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #79:3>
Latest interim results show profit and earnings back down by half and although there was previous warning , hopes of a second-half upturn as heavy investment and speedier servicing of customers in Europe came into play are slipping away .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #80:3>
Once again , turnover showed no advance and although the sale of the Manesty machine business to Barry Wehmiller earlier in the year accounts for it , the &pound-sign;6 million shortfall at &pound-sign;65.4 million was disappointing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #81:3>
The slump in pre-tax profit to &pound-sign;2.1 million from &pound-sign;4 million came after interest saving worth &pound-sign;600,000 , though half that went on exceptional charges .

As usual , the second half is expected to be better , assuming that the recession is shallow , but the last total of just over &pound-sign;9 million is way out of reach .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #83:3>
So far , the return on &pound-sign;20 million or more of recent investment is meagre .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #84:3>
The interim dividend is held at 1.2p , but earnings of under 2p suggest that a full return to the distribution level of over 10 years ago will be long-delayed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #85:3>
ALTHOUGH Wm Cook , the Sheffield foundry group that is doing most to revitalise the sector , still has ample benefits from the rationalisation of the George Blair acquisition in the North-east to come , the chairman , Andrew Cook is aghast at the fixing of a high sterling exchange rate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #86:3>
Earnings on the enlarged capital were almost steady in the latest half-year , but margins are under some pressure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #87:3>
In line with the preceding second half , sales were &pound-sign;70.4 million , against &pound-sign;42.6 million before the completion of the acquisition programme and its commendation by the Monopolies Commission .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #88:3>
Pre-tax profit jumped to &pound-sign;5.8 million , from &pound-sign;3.7 million after interest charges up by half to &pound-sign;1 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #89:3>
Rationalisation is continuing and the sale of surplus Newcastle and Chesterfield sites should bring further overhead reductions next year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-005 #90:3>
The interim dividend is lifted to 5p , from 4.5p and retentions continue to be high so there is little doubt that a new profit record will be achieved , possibly extending to earnings .

Brittan offers new European option
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #3:1>
By Patrick Wintour Political Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #4:1>
SIR Leon Brittan , the senior European Commissioner , tried to throw the Conservative Party a European lifeline yesterday when he suggested other community countries would accept Britain 's delaying a decision on joining a single currency until after the next election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #5:1>
Sir Leon said that Mrs Thatcher 's government needed , at this stage , only to agree to take an active part in the negotiations for a single currency , and not to veto other community countries changing the Treaty of Rome to allow for a single currency .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #6:1>
The formula would leave the final decision on Britain joining a single European currency as late as 1993 , by which time a new British Parliament would have been elected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #7:1>
Last weekend 's Rome EC summit agreed that the start of the second phase of economic and monetary union , including a fully fledged European Central Bank , should start in January 1994 , to be followed within three years by a decision on a single currency .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #8:1>
Mrs Thatcher responded by saying she would never put such a proposal to Parliament .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #9:1>
But Sir Leon , as vice-president of the commission and a former member of Mrs Thatcher 's Cabinet , believes that his latest formula could draw support on the Tory benches as a generally acceptable policy to put to next month 's inter-governmental conference in Rome , at which details of economic union are to be discussed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #10:1>
It might also prevent the IGC ending with a two-tier Europe and Britain irrevocably split from the 11 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #11:1>
Sir Leon , speaking on BBC TV 's On the Record , argued that the way to get Mrs Thatcher off the hook was for &ldquo; Britain to take part actively in the negotiations for settling the details and arrangements for Economic and Monetary Union &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #12:1>
Mrs Thatcher could make it clear that Britain is not accepting that it will join , but does accept other countries may do so after January 1994 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #13:1>
Previously , Sir Leon has suggested that the British government would only be granted latitude by its European partners on the date for joining a single currency if it accepted that the ultimate objective was a single currency .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #14:1>
His latest formula drew a cool reaction from senior Treasury ministers last night .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #15:1>
One said : &ldquo; It would be horribly dishonest ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #16:1>
it is something we could not do . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #17:1>
But the Foreign Secretary , Douglas Hurd , argued that Britain would be in a central position at the Rome IGC , since the other European countries could not amend the Treaty of Rome without British consent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #18:1>
He claimed that the British proposal for a common currency based on the hard ecu was a more sophisticated position than that of most European partners .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #19:1>
The common currency , he said , might become a single currency , but only through the decision of individuals to choose to use the hard ecu rather than their own currency .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #20:1>
But he predicted the single currency would not evolve in this way &ldquo; in the lifetime of this parliament , or I would guess in the lifetime of the next parliament &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #21:1>
A group of anti-marketeers on the back benches , the Conservative European Reform Group , underlined their hostility to any further integration with Europe yesterday in a pamphlet calling on the Government to loosen its links with the community by joining the lower rung of a two-tier Europe .

Empty chairs prevent replay of Bar victories
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #24:2>
By Clare Dyer Legal Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #25:2>
THE BAR was determined to devise strategies to ensure its existence was never threatened again , its chairman , Peter Cresswell , planned to tell the troops at the Bar 's annual general meeting on Saturday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #26:2>
And he would have done if the troops had bothered to turn up .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #27:2>
An embarrassed Sir Patrick Mayhew , QC , the Attorney-General , who was to chair the meeting as head of the Bar , had to cancel it after only 48 of the 6,000 practising barristers in England and Wales arrived at the Camden Centre in north London .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #28:2>
The rules require 60 for a quorum .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #29:2>
Sandwiches laid on for 200 barristers went to Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital instead .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #30:2>
One attender , who described the non-event as a farce , attributed the lack of interest to a boring agenda and the absence of motions to be voted on .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #31:2>
Had they shown up , barristers would have heard a stirring account of how their leaders had routed the opposing army of the Law Society on the battlefield of the Courts and Legal Services Bill ( now Act ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #32:2>
Government plans to allow direct access by the public to barristers , partnerships between barristers and solicitors , and multi-disciplinary practices of lawyers , accountants and other professionals had been shot down , Mr Cresswell would have told them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #33:2>
Repeated attempts by the Law Society and others to undermine the position of the four senior judges with a veto over solicitors ' rights of audience under the act had been defeated , their leader would have added .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #34:2>
The society was also repulsed in its attempt to get immediate rights for solicitors to handle guilty pleas in the crown court .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #35:2>
Mr Cresswell 's account of the Bar 's successes during his term in office is the latest example of a new phenomenon in legal circles , the undelivered speech .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #36:2>
The Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay , started the fashion last month at the Law Society 's conference in Glasgow when he failed to deliver his scheduled address , copies of which had been circulated in advance to journalists .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #37:2>
Sources said the content was thought to be insufficiently gripping .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #38:2>
Mr Cresswell , however , hopes to have another stab at delivering his speech next weekend , when the Bar Council meets to elect officers for next year .

Boost for hospital building fund
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #41:3>
By David Brindle , Social Services Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #42:3>
THE Health Secretary , William Waldegrave , is to announce a substantial cash boost for the hospital building programme , which has been stricken by a &pound-sign;200 mill million fall in sales of surplus National Health Service land .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #43:3>
The minister is in the fortunate position of being able , as almost his first act in office , to unveil an overall spending increase of about &pound-sign;2.4 billion negotiated for the NHS in 1991/2 by his predecessor Kenneth Clarke , who has been shifted to education .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #44:3>
A key part of this package will be money to shore up hospital building schemes , which are grinding to a halt in some parts of the country because the collapse of the property market has thwarted anticipated land sales .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #45:3>
This year , the Government provided just under &pound-sign;1.1 bill billion for NHS capital spending in England .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #46:3>
It budgeted for health authorities to raise a further &pound-sign;290 mill million through land sales , much of it in the South-east .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #47:3>
Failure to realise the bulk of these sales , and consequent cancellation or postponement of building schemes , led to a recent meeting between Mr Clarke and concerned backbench Tory MPs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #48:3>
The overall NHS spending increase , to be announced as part of the autumn statement , will be the third successive &pound-sign;2 billion-plus rise billion-plus rise .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #49:3>
It will take the service 's budget for the UK to more than &pound-sign;31 billion .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #50:3>
However , the autumn survey by the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts , to be published this week , will suggest that the NHS needs far more than &pound-sign;2.4 billion extra .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #51:3>
The association has already calculated that the service is suffering a shortfall of &pound-sign;806 mill million in 1990/1 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #52:3>
Its survey will show how this , combined with the requirement to balance health authority books for the NHS shake-up next April , is causing bed closures .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #53:3>
Mr Waldegrave , expected to take a softer line on the shake-up than Mr Clarke , is due to announce at the end of the month which hospitals will opt out in April .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #54:3>
A total of 66 hospitals and other NHS units applied for self-governing trust status in the first wave .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #55:3>
Three-month public consultation periods have now all but ended .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #56:3>
The South West Thames region has itself recommended that one of its applicants , the proposed Crawley and Horsham trust in West Sussex , be deferred .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #57:3>
Other applicants thought to be doubtful starters include the planned City and Hackney trust in east London , and St Thomas 's hospital in south London .

Thatcher loyalists close ranks
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #62:4>
By Michael White Political Editor
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #63:4>
THE prospects of a Michael Heseltine-inspired challenge to Mrs Thatcher 's leadership of the Conservative Party prompted a counter-attack last night as ministerial heavy artillery was wheeled into place to try to crush a revolt before it has time to organise a contest next month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #64:4>
Among the Prime Minister 's more cautious critics attention was already refocusing on the hope that the party 's general election prospects might be less damaged if what one called &ldquo; retirement through the old-fashioned method &rdquo; could be engineered in the new year if Tory prospects fail to improve .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #65:4>
Last night , this looked as remote as ever .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #66:4>
After three days of rising turmoil in the ranks , the official Whitehall word was that Mrs Thatcher was in an &ldquo; ebullient and uncompromising mood &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #67:4>
She has , however , been sufficiently stung by Mr Heseltine 's barely coded attack upon her in his weekend constituency letter to make the Queen 's Speech debate on Wednesday the occasion to reassert mastery of a divided party .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #68:4>
But high-level jitters after Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation were underscored by the sight of at least six cabinet ministers finding time on a Sunday to denounce Mr Heseltine 's penmanship as &ldquo; trivial &rdquo; got up by the press .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #69:4>
Their efforts were buttressed by middle-ranking ministers , led by Michael Portillo .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #70:4>
Loyalists are expected to threaten to use this month 's annual elections to the backbench 1922 committee executive to punish MPs who step out of line .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #71:4>
Sir Geoffrey 's friends are adamant that the former deputy prime minister will not himself launch a leadership bid .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #72:4>
Apart from a brief telephone conversation there has been no contact between Sir Geoffrey and Mr Heseltine but Heseltine supporters believe Sir Geoffrey must speak out if he is not to be regarded as virtually retired .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #73:4>
There is every likelihood he will intervene in the week-long Commons debate to air his grievances , as Nigel Lawson did last year on the self-same issue of European economic and monetary union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #74:4>
At the same time , the Chancellor , John Major , has decided to bring forward publication of his autumn financial statement to coincide with two critical byelections in Bradford North and Bootle on Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #75:4>
Amid gloomy economic news and business worries over European policy , further highlighted at a weekend CBI conference in Glasgow , Mr Major will offer the prospect of lower inflation and higher public expenditure on popular services next spring .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #76:4>
A clutch of opinion polls gave comfort to both sides in the simmering civil war yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #77:4>
They showed Labour anything up to 21 per cent ahead and voters happy to see Mr Heseltine as next party leader .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #78:4>
But among the electoral college of Tory MPs who will actually pick that leader , most tests of opinion showed strong opposition - around three to one - to a leadership battle next month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #79:4>
With a series of unavoidable tests for the party 's collective nerve now imminent , the Foreign Secretary , Douglas Hurd , and Norman Tebbit , still the party 's leading backbench streetfighter , effectively joined forces to deride the weekend letter Mr Heseltine wrote before flying off to the Middle East .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #80:4>
Some Conservative MPs on either side privately argued that Mr Heseltine had gone too far this time to be able to draw back without fatal loss of face , and had , moreover , insulted his colleagues with a call for the Cabinet to enforce a collective line to save the party from defeat .
<ICE-GB:W2C-006 #81:4>
In a lengthy interview by Brian Walden on ITV , in which he smoothly reiterated protestations of cabinet unity , Mr Hurd said he thought the letter not &ldquo; particularly wise &rdquo; .

Scotland
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #6:1>
THE ritual that accompanied the lopping off of yet another Scottish arm of British Steel 's operations has become as familiar as a courtship dance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #7:1>
The shop stewards ' convener looks dumbstruck , although storm cones have been raised at the works for months .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #8:1>
The Scottish secretary applies the balm of mellow tones to the wound he has nothing else to offer peppered with side-swipes at BS management .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #9:1>
His Labour shadow rattles off a few rounds from his verbal sten-gun in outrage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #10:1>
The SNP hopes to woo workers from Labour by fomenting industrial unrest .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #11:1>
BS management pleads irreversible unprofitability , but plays hard-to-get on the figures , and an economic think-tank claims horrific consequential job losses that assume the whole community will curl up its toes and collect dole forever .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #12:1>
It is as pointless as it is predictable , for not one of the actors in this drama is prepared to change his script .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #13:1>
If there is to be any long-term future for the Scottish steel industry , we suggest they all learn new lines .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #14:1>
Malcolm Rifkind should give up hand-wringing and admit that , in an industry now governed by competition , calling for figures and berating BS for acting as it pleases is only a fig-leaf for government embarrassment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #15:1>
He might ponder that setting up a privatised steel monopoly to replace a nationalised one has been a mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #16:1>
The suspicion that Robert Scholey , BS chairman , has his own agenda for closing down steel production in Scotland , come what may , is hard to resist .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #17:1>
Mr Rifkind likes to think the industry is swathed in guarantees and undertakings screwed out of BS at privatisation , but they are as floss in the wind when hard commercial decisions are made .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #18:1>
Mr Scholey 's job is to provide the best return for BS shareholders , not to ensure his company is spread thinly round the UK .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #19:1>
But handing the newly-privatised steelmaker a UK monopoly , when EC quotas were strict and foreign competition strong , was an invitation to fight foreigners only and rationalise at home .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #20:1>
The government was mesmerised by the BS plea that only massive economies of scale could save the industry .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #21:1>
Without domestic competition , BS had no need to invest in small , specialist plants such as Clydesdale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #22:1>
Tubes for North Sea oil wells were simply not a management priority .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #23:1>
Although it is impossible to reopen plant that has been closed , Mr Rifkind might have a chance to use his SDA study as a lever to inject competition into the industry , even at this late stage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #24:1>
So , if what is left of the Scottish steel industry could form the kernel of a commercial competitor to BS , he should make that assessment now , not wait until the industry is so clapped out as to be worthless .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #25:1>
Of course , BS would squeal , but it could hardly complain if closure were its only aim .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #26:1>
Donald Dewar has the more difficult task of admitting his leader has made no commitment to renationalise steel .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #27:1>
Without that pledge , all Mr Dewar can do is weep crocodile tears .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #28:1>
True , he makes a good fist of his fury on the floor of the Commons but , with an election due within 18 months , we are entitled to hear his step-by-step approach to halt closure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #29:1>
Our Platform column is at his disposal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #30:1>
The SNP argument is startlingly simple .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #31:1>
In an independent Scotland the government would step in and take over .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #32:1>
It is also startlingly false , for intervention of the kind the SNP proposes has been banned by the European Community .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #33:1>
Years spent squeezing over-production of heavily subsidised steel out of a reluctant Europe will not be reversed because the SNP snaps its fingers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #34:1>
There will be problems enough coping with the rundown of clapped-out Eastern Bloc mills without pandering to Alex Salmond .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #35:1>
Mr Scholey has behaved within his rights , but badly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #36:1>
Refusing to explain the figures may seem smart , but kindles suspicion that he has something to hide .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #37:1>
Straightforward folk are unconvinced that a plant that breaks production records regularly is fit only for closing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #38:1>
If all is as bad as he claims , he should publish the facts and win the argument .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #39:1>
And so to the Fraser of Allander Institute , that prognosticator of doom and gloom , outdone in pessimism only by the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #40:1>
Wasting effort assessing a notional job-loss total , consequent on closure , is as pointless as suggesting we will be wet on Thursday because it is raining on Tuesday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #41:1>
In communities hit by other mass closures , such as Linwood and Bathgate , new enterprise has brought back jobs often cleaner and better-paid than those they replace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #42:1>
Instead , could academics bend their slide rules towards preparing a formal prospectus for Scottish Steel plc and tout it round potential private investors ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #43:1>
Or are they , like the politicians , happier to live by their rituals ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #44:1>
For what they all fear is that these rituals conceal a bitter truth &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #45:1>
there is no Scottish steel industry worth the saving .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #46:1>
Playing the old , familiar game is preferable to admitting that .

Justice For Criminals &semi; Leading Article
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #49:2>
Whisper it not in Pinner , but the government 's criminal justice bill , published yesterday , is designed to stop judges putting burglars in prison .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #50:2>
In future , statutory guidelines will lay down that imprisonment should be imposed only when the offence is &ldquo; so serious &rdquo; or the danger of &ldquo; serious harm &rdquo; to the public so great , that only prison will do .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #51:2>
Moreover , judges are to take far less account of the offender 's past record .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #52:2>
Locking up the habitual burglar will become far harder .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #53:2>
And fines are to be related for the first time to the offender 's income , so that the jails will be less crowded with those who will not pay because they cannot .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #54:2>
Since this is a Tory government David Waddington , the home secretary , had of course to pretend otherwise .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #55:2>
He described the new policy as &ldquo; a more coherent legislative framework for sentencing &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #56:2>

<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #62:2>
If and when Mr Waddington rises next year again to appease the law-and-order mob at the Conservative party conference , he will have plenty of ammunition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #63:2>
Yet this is a bill that offers more , on balance , to liberal reformers than to their opponents .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #64:2>
No doubt , money played its part in this .

Imperative too is the need to economise at the Home Office .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #73:2>
No responsible government could continue lavish spending on the police , and on jails , without a scrap of evidence that crime is thereby being prevented .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #74:2>
The alternatives to the measures in the bill are more violence in prison , more suicides , more human degradation and more expenditure , with no discernible advantage to the wider community .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #75:2>
Parliament , however , has scope to improve on what the home secretary has begun .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #76:2>
One set of proposals ought to be rejected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #77:2>
Parents of juveniles may be fined if their youngster 's offences can be blamed on them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #78:2>
This is the kind of proposal that makes perfect sense to middle class ministers , who generally leave the taming of adolescence to their children 's boarding schools .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #79:2>
For , say , the single mother in Brixton , struggling against odds to keep a young person on track , they represent only a threat .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #80:2>
Many such parents will be tempted to wash their hands of their responsibilities .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #81:2>
Parental influence the last , best hope of deflecting the youngster from a life of crime will be removed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #82:2>
The magistrates do not want these powers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #83:2>
Parliament should not force them to have them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #84:2>
Another provision ought to be added .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #85:2>
The guidelines , though an improvement , still give the judges considerable discretion .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #86:2>
Much depends on how the appeal court interprets them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #87:2>
All this is hazardous .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #88:2>
The transmission mechanism between parliament , Home Office and the judiciary is creaky and ineffective .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #89:2>
Judges are notoriously their own creatures , disinclined through long exercise of power to heed outside influence .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #90:2>
Penal reformers , now backed by the Labour party , have long advocated the creation of a sentencing council .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #91:2>

Once it was said there was blood on British coal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #97:3>
Tragically since the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988 it can more truly be said there is blood in British oil .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #98:3>
The fire which destroyed the North Sea rig and killed 167 workers was unsurpassed in its horror .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #99:3>
As an appropriate tribute to those who lost their lives , Lord Cullen 's enquiry into past causes and future remedies of the disaster was unsurpassed in its thoroughness .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #100:3>
His report , published yesterday , demands fundamental changes in the way safety is regulated in the North Sea .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #101:3>
His main conclusion is that the industry should come &ldquo; on-shore &rdquo; by submitting to the jurisdiction of the independent Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) , as land-based industry already has to do .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #102:3>
The clear implication is that the disaster would not have happened or would have been less likely had that been the case at the time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #103:3>
For a decade the government has ignored voices in the industry calling for this change .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #104:3>
The unions and the TUC continually pressed for it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #105:3>
The previous Labour government , before it lost the 1979 election , was proposing to legislate accordingly , and has continued to argue for it in opposition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #106:3>
So it cannot be claimed the dogs did not bark , only that those particular dogs had barked too often without good cause for the government to pay attention .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #107:3>
It is an unconvincing excuse .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #108:3>
For no good reason , safety in the North Sea was left to the oversight of the energy department , whose main responsibility was to ensure the commercial exploitation of Britain 's oil reserves as efficiently and cheaply as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #109:3>
This had two dire consequences .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #110:3>
It created an obvious conflict of interest within the department itself , so that whenever safety was at odds with production there was a temptation to give precedence to the latter .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #111:3>
And it lent itself to a cosy relationship between the safety regulators and the oil platform owners and managers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #112:3>
But safety is about discipline , and sometimes about penalties for indiscipline , including the threat to shut down production entirely .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #113:3>
Land-based industry has long learnt to fear the powers of the HSE , and to treat its inspections and instructions with careful respect .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #114:3>
Lord Cullen identifies several instances before the fire when inspections of Piper Alpha conducted by the energy department were perfunctory , and it is hard to believe they were being taken seriously either by those doing the inspecting or those being inspected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #115:3>
Senior managers were too easily satisfied that all was well .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #116:3>
The inspectors lacked sufficient powers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #117:3>
The owners came to believe they would not use the powers they did have .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #118:3>
The combination created a climate in which safety was not put first .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #119:3>
The dreadful truth to come out of the Cullen enquiry is that the 167 need not have died .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #120:3>
To its credit , the industry has a guilty conscience .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #121:3>
It was as shocked by the disaster as it was careless before it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #122:3>
The evidence given to Cullen was monitored closely and the most important recommendations were anticipated by the operators without waiting for yesterday 's publication .
<ICE-GB:W2C-007 #123:3>
Major engineering works to transfer the location of cut-off valves to sea level are in hand , part of a safety programme in the North Sea costing up to &pound-sign;750 million .

Mikhail Gorbachev 's meeting yesterday with Boris Yeltsin , president of the Russian Federation , came none too soon .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #5:1>
Economic dislocation has reached the point at which insubordination could turn into revolution , as yesterday 's extension of rationing in Moscow emphasised .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #6:1>
While one republic after another opts out of the empire , taking discontented Russian minorities with them , the economy is regressing into a hotchpotch of autarkies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #7:1>
Can Mr Gorbachev still save the Soviet Union ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #8:1>
Even Mr Gorbachev 's most reliable friends in the West , the Germans , now doubt whether foreign help can affect Mr Gorbachev 's fate , let alone that of his domain .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #9:1>
Economic stabilisation must therefore come about by the Soviet leadership 's own efforts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #10:1>
That requires popular consent , which has never been forthcoming for the Soviet regime .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #11:1>
At last Wednesday 's parades in Moscow and Leningrad , unofficial banners alluded to Dostoevsky , who along with Solzhenitsyn has become the prophet of Russian nationalism : &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #12:1>
1917 the crime , 1990 the punishment . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #13:1>
Intimations of the end of Lenin 's system have affected the public mood throughout the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #14:1>
This eschatological dynamic will continue to undermine the authority of the Soviet state .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #15:1>
Moreover , as the economist Stanislav Shatalin said last week , there is a real danger that the proposed compensation for price increases will cause hyperinflation , and consequential social dissolution .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #16:1>
Separatist ambitions thrive in this climate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #17:1>
The Baltic states have drawn back from their initial uncompromising stance , but have conceded nothing essential .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #18:1>
Plans for moving the headquarters of the Baltic military district from Riga to Kaliningrad suggest that these small states are to be treated as foreign soil .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #19:1>
But the Baltic states are dispensable compared to the Ukrainian republic .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #20:1>
Ukraine lacks oil , but much Soviet oil comes from the Transcaucasian republics , now also aspiring to independence , which could try to bypass Moscow by selling oil directly to Ukrainian nationalists .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #21:1>
The Ukrainian economy is vital to Russia .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #22:1>
Moscow has no choice but to come to terms with Kiev .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #23:1>
But the most amicable divorce would still mean the end of the union .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #24:1>
Mr Gorbachev has very few cards left to play .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #25:1>
Mr Shatalin maintains that it is already too late for his 500-day plan , which depended on stabilising the rouble .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #26:1>
The Supreme Soviet has hitherto rejected all economic agreements which respect the sovereignty of the republics , with the result that the government 's own apology for a plan is proceeding without any co-ordination between centre and periphery .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #27:1>
A new constitutional dispensation has been promised but not yet delivered by Mr Gorbachev .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #28:1>
There is no consensus about the shape of any future Soviet commonwealth .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #29:1>
The only immediate measure within Mr Gorbachev 's wide-ranging presidential powers with a chance of success would be the delegation of the day-to-day running of the economy to the republics .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #30:1>
Such devolution of authority would be a huge step towards a confederal system , but at least it would have been conceded voluntarily .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #31:1>
The state would then be free to concentrate on internal security , defence and foreign affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #32:1>
The nationalists , too , have their problems .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #33:1>
They know that a total breakdown of the Soviet Union would leave behind a leaner Russian Federation which , without the handicap of Leninist ideology , must sooner or later recover its strength .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #34:1>
A resurgent Russian nationalist government might seem less congenial to the smaller republics than a weak Soviet one .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #35:1>
By playing on these fears , Mr Gorbachev might still hope at least to postpone the end , if he can last until the spring of 1991 without bread riots .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #36:1>
That is highly uncertain .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #37:1>
The best perhaps the only method of averting them would be to deal on equal terms with the elected governments of the republics .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #38:1>
Unless he can bring himself to compromise with Mr Yeltsin and other republican leaders this winter , Mr Gorbachev faces catastrophe .

The first part of the ceremonies marking the formal accession of Emperor Akihito to the Chrysanthemum throne takes place today in the state hall of the Imperial Palace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #43:2>
The presence of dignitaries from 158 countries is a tribute to Japan 's importance in the modern world , but the ritual will bring home forcefully the enduring weight of Japanese tradition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #44:2>
Uneasy memories will be stirred as the prime minister wishes the emperor 10,000 years of life with the cry of banzai !
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #45:2>
The imperial family 's remoteness from ordinary Japanese will be underlined by the absence of a coronation procession .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #46:2>
Tokyo 's normally teeming streets have been cleared by 37,000 police .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #47:2>
The main reason for such tight security is the domestic controversy surrounding the second , religious , ritual on November 22 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #48:2>
The daijosai is more than the &ldquo; great food offering ritual &rdquo; which is its literal translation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #49:2>
Alone in a shrine in the palace grounds , the emperor communes with the sun goddess Amaterasu in a rite which , according to tradition , transforms him into a living god .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #50:2>
The government 's decision to finance this ceremony raises constitutional issues quite as lively as its proposal , rescinded last week , to send members of Japan 's defence forces to the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #51:2>
In 1946 Emperor Showa , as Hirohito has been called since his death , renounced his divinity and the postwar Japanese constitution enjoins the state to refrain from all religious activity .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #52:2>
State funding for the daijosai represents a victory for the right , which rejects the American-drafted constitution as an alien imposition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #53:2>
The Japanese left has been more vociferous than any foreigner in protesting against a ritual which some see reviving a cult of nationalism centred on worship of the emperor .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #54:2>
Some citizens have even brought suit in Japan 's courts , claiming a violation of the constitution .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #55:2>
These anxieties could be laid to rest were the Imperial Household Agency , which dictates every detail of imperial behaviour , to adjust its inward-looking traditions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #56:2>
It should reflect the new emperor 's desire to bring the palace closer to the people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #57:2>
Married to a commoner , Emperor Akihito has insisted on educating his sons abroad and made no secret of his envy for the relative freedoms enjoyed by Britain 's royal family .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #58:2>
His sincere ( if over-choreographed ) statements of &ldquo; regret &rdquo; to China and Korea indicate that he would use greater freedom to promote a more outward-looking Japan .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #59:2>
In a joint press conference with Empress Michiko last year , itself a remarkable innovation , he expressed the desire to deepen Japanese interest in the environment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #60:2>
He has little patience with the right 's view that the emperor should be &ldquo; as obscure as a Shinto god &rdquo; , none with the traditional Japanese claims to divine roots which derive from the emperor 's godhead .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #61:2>
Postwar Japan , pacific , industrious and in its own way democratic , belongs in the best , not the worst , traditions of the 20th century .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #62:2>
A modern form of constitutional monarchy would consolidate and lend continuity to the country 's remarkable transformation .

John Major 's autumn statement confirms that what was once a radical Conservative government has now become a conventional conservative government .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #69:3>
Faced with economic recession , a radical Conservative government would have cut spending .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #70:3>
This conventional conservative government is to increase it by 2.2 per cent in real terms next year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #71:3>
A radical Conservative government would have hung its head in shame at spending more public money on roads and rail , schools and hospitals , rather than throwing the burden on to private investment , pricing and insurance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #72:3>
This conventional conservative government milks the taxpayers ' pockets for every vote the Exchequer can buy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #73:3>
The Chancellor did not mention privatisation , gave only a nod to monetary targets , entirely ignored wealth creation and the supply side , and preached pay restraint .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #74:3>
It was as if the radicalism of 1980-81 had never happened .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #75:3>
No doubt Mr Major 's presentation owes something to the proximity of the general election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #76:3>
Politicians , Mrs Thatcher included , are happy to inveigh against the wickedness of bribing voters with their own money early in a parliament .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #77:3>
But they rarely choose to put such discipline to an electoral test .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #78:3>
Fortunately on this occasion , what is wise politically is also right economically .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #79:3>
The Chancellor did not use the word recession , but his forecasts show that the country is in one .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #80:3>
The economy has shrunk between the first half and second half of this year , and it will stagnate over the first six months of next year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #81:3>
In these circumstances , to cut public spending would be hideously difficult and for what ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #82:3>
To reduce demand even further , deepening the hole out of which the economy has to climb ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #83:3>
To cut spending on the infrastructure of transport , and on investment in training , on which future prosperity in part depends ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #84:3>
To continue to run a public sector surplus , although &pound-sign;27 billi billion in public debt has already been repaid , and although a balanced budget is a tough enough target ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #85:3>
Too tight a policy would mean a longer , deeper recession .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #86:3>
The proposed increase in public spending is a modest one .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #87:3>
Provided the rest of the economy develops as the Chancellor hopes , public expenditure will not rise above its present 39 1/2 per cent of national income over the next two years .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #88:3>
This is 7 percentage points below its 1984-85 peak , and 4 percentage points below its level when the Tories came to power .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #89:3>
A further fall is in prospect for 1993-94 , if the temptation to spend more in the interim is resisted .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #90:3>
The Treasury has also secured some epic cuts : in discretionary social security , in the Home Office budget and , at least in year three of the survey period , in defence , which will by then be taking its lowest proportion of national income since 1945 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #91:3>
These are strong arguments against deeper cuts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #92:3>
But they raise a further and more challenging question .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #93:3>
Ought not the government to be planning to spend more ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #94:3>
Nobody would advocate a wild and reckless spree .

That would merely upset the markets and encourage inflation .

<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #111:4>
The diplomatic endgame has begun .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #112:4>
If the United Nations is to continue to play a role , the security council must begin to move towards military enforcement under Article 42 of the UN Charter .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #113:4>
It should recognise that economic sanctions are proving to be inadequate to restore peace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #114:4>
Saddam has to be convinced that , however repugnant such a decision must be , the world is seriously preparing to use force as a last resort .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #115:4>
The main purpose of Mr Baker 's tour of Arab and European capitals has been to sound out the willingness of key players on the council to take that step .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #116:4>
His task is to convince those powers , notably the Soviet Union and China but including France , which have been most insistent that force should be used only if specifically authorised by the UN , that their strict interpretation of legality cannot be a pretext for inaction or appeasement .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #117:4>
They must demonstrate that they are committed to collective enforcement of international law .
<ICE-GB:W2C-008 #118:4>
The American decision to seek security council endorsement of military action is wise .

The Government proposal to curb private sector property leasing could mean Brent Tenants facing rent rises of between &pound-sign;343 and &pound-sign;754 plus a &pound-sign;31 poll tax increase poll tax increase .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #5:1>
Currently Brent pays &pound-sign;4,000 per year to house a family in private leased property - as opposed to &pound-sign;6,500 in bed and break<l>fast - and a subsidy cut would push this cost to &pound-sign;8,840 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #6:1>
Housing chiefs , who would face a pos<l>sible &pound-sign;12m deficit , will be forced to put Brent 's homeless into B&ampersand;B accommoda<l>tion or hotels .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #7:1>
Director of Housing Mike Wilson has written to the Secretary of State for the En<l>vironment urging him to &ldquo; withdraw his proposals or to accept responsibility for Brent 's homeless . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #8:1>
The council wants the proposals &ldquo; abandoned &rdquo; until a means is found to replace temporary accommodation with permanent housing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #9:1>
Mr Wilson said : &ldquo; Reductions in leased subsidy levels would hit councils with the highest levels of homelessness , such as Brent , the hardest . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #10:1>
Labour and Liberal Democrat council<l>lors have made representations to the Gove<l>rnment condemning the plans while concerned Conservative members have written separately .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #11:1>
Cllr Cyril Shaw , Labour housing spokesman , said : &ldquo; It would be an open cheque .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #12:1>
Everybody will lose except the Treasury . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #13:1>
Conservative housing spokesman Cllr Irwin Van Colle said : &ldquo; The Government has moved the goal posts and we are not terribly excited about it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #14:1>
&rdquo; The leasing industry has grown like Topsy , and I am not surprised that the Gov<l>ernment has put the brakes on it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #15:1>
One has to be quietly hopeful rather than optimis<l>tic that something may come come out of the representations . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #16:1>
Paul Lorber , Liberal De<l>mocrat housing spokes<l>man , said : &rdquo; The Government is just putting the boot in .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #17:1>
It will add to the misery and force the council to put the home<l>less into seedy B&ampersand;B accomm ac<l>commodation elsewhere . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #18:1>
A DoE spokesman said : &rdquo; The matter was the sub<l>ject of a consultation pa<l>per .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #19:1>
Everybody put forward their views and this is what came out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #20:1>
&ldquo; A year ago leasing was considerd considered the way to ad<l>dress the homelessness problem .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #21:1>
It got out of hand when we allowed councils to get 100 per cent subsi<l>dies on leasing -
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #22:1>
there was no ceiling on how much they could lease .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #23:1>
&rdquo; Councils were spend<l>ing twice as much money as there was in the pot .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #24:1>
We had to put the brakes on it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #25:1>
Now we are telling councils to lease within a budget

Centre gets a last chance
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #28:2>
by Nigel Morris
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #29:2>
A DEBT-ridden Brent community centre has been thrown a &rdquo; last chance &ldquo; &pound-sign;1m plus lifeline last chance √¨ ¬£1m plus life<l>line by council chiefs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #30:2>
Over the next two-and-a-half years the Bridge Park centre in Harrow Road - opened by Prince Charles in 1988 - will re<l>ceive &pound-sign;1,412,00 in reve<l>nue from the council .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #31:2>
The centre , which owed &pound-sign;10,000 in unpaid gas and electricity bills three weeks ago , has also been granted a three-year repay<l>ment freeze on a &pound-sign;220,000 debt debt debt to the council .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #32:2>
Councillors at last Mon<l>day 's policy and resources committee made the deci<l>sion but tempered it with a warning .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #33:2>
Conservative group lea<l>der Cllr Bob Blackman said : &rdquo; This is the very last chance for Bridge Park .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #34:2>
We have now seen a sens<l>ible business plan from the centre and agreed to fund the project for social schemes in Stonebridge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #35:2>
&ldquo; We all hope that the project will now succeed and represent a success for the community within Brent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #36:2>
&rdquo; There will be no fur<l>ther chances for Bridge Park if it fails to live within the tight financial con<l>straints which we have imposed . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #37:2>
The centre will receive &pound-sign;375,000 in 1991/2 , &pound-sign;285,000 in 1992/3 and &pound-sign;200,000 in 1993/4 - but there will be no grant aid from 1994/5 onwards .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #38:2>
Brent Liberal Democrat leader John Hammond said : &rdquo; Some of the points of major concern about the project have now been resolved .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #39:2>
&ldquo; This , however , is abso<l>lutely the final opportun<l>ity for the project to become a going concern .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #40:2>
If the business plan fails there will be no further support from the council and , sadly , the project will have to be wound up . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #41:2>
Financial adviser David Innes , who is now the cen<l>tre 's general manager , ex<l>plained that staff were &ldquo; very mindful &rdquo; that the lifeline was being viewed as their last chance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #42:2>
He said : &ldquo; All of us are very pleased that the deci<l>sion went the way it did -
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #43:2>
it is a gesture of faith in Bridge Park .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #44:2>
We will have to work very hard . &rdquo;

Taxpayers ' card &lsquo; bribe &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #46:3>
by Nigel Morris
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #47:3>
A NEW card offering dis<l>count and benefits to poll taxpayers has been labelled a &ldquo; bribe &rdquo; by a Brent pressure group .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #48:3>
The Brent Resident Card , with its own account number , would entitle the poll taxpayer to discounts at shops and rest<l>aurants and reduced entry to sports centres and theatres .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #49:3>
Conservative councillors pro<l>posed the card at a policy and re<l>sources committee meeting on Monday of last week as part of a wholesale review of poll tax payment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #50:3>
But the chairman of Brent Against The Poll Tax , Theresa Dean , slated the proposal , say<l>ing : &ldquo; This is a bribe to lure people into paying the poll tax . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #51:3>
Currently there are 70,000 Brent residents who have not made any payment while over 60,000 have made only one .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #52:3>
Ms Dean does not think the offer of the card will bring non<l->payers &ldquo; in from the cold &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #53:3>
She said : &ldquo; The opposition to the tax among those people is such that I don't think the card will make much difference to them . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #54:3>
Tory leader Cllr Bob Black<l>man said : &ldquo; Brent Council must demonstrate to the charge-payer that it provides valuable ser<l>vices to the community .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #55:3>
&rdquo; Our proposal for a Brent Re<l>sident Card will provide a posi<l>tive step .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #56:3>
The card would also ease payment of the Community Charge by providing each resi<l>dent with his or her own ac<l>count number and could be used for paying their Community Charge account . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #57:3>
He added : &rdquo; We need to im<l>prove methods of collection of the Community Charge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #58:3>
Above all we need to show the charge<l->payer that there are positive benefits as a result of paying the charge early and in full . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #59:3>
Liberal Democrats leader Cllr John Hammond said it was &rdquo; sensible &ldquo; to discuss ways in which residents could pay the tax quickly and easily .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #60:3>
He added : &rdquo; The more effi<l>cient the method of payment , the quicker the council will re<l>ceive money to pay for its ser<l>vices . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #61:3>
Labour leader Cllr Dorman Long , who is totally opposed to the tax , said : &rdquo; It makes sense to create a system whereby people can pay the tax as easily as pos<l>sible .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #62:3>
These initiatives may re<l>duce the number of non-payers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #63:3>
&ldquo; We all hate to pay it but un<l>fortunately it is the law and if you don't pay you lose your ser<l>vices . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #64:4>
Weather aborts poll tax march
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #65:4>
A PLANNED anti-poll tax march in Brent was can<l>celled after the rallying cry fell on deaf ears .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #66:4>
Brent Against the Poll Tax was forced to call off the planned march through the streets of Harlesden after only a handful of supporters gathered at Roundwood Park earlier this month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #67:4>
Disappointed organisers aborted the demonstration , which was planned to end with the burning of an effigy of Prime Minister John Major , and staged a rally with the 30 protestors who braved the cold weather .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #68:4>
Brent Against the Poll Tax spokesman , Mick Woods , said : &ldquo; It was certainly not worth walking through the streets in the dark with virtually no-one . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #69:4>
The group , which has gained minor victories by for<l>cing adjournments in the prosecution of six of poll tax non-payers , claimed the fight was far from over .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #70:4>
Mr Woods said : &ldquo; The whole legal basis is very com<l>plicated .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #71:4>
We try to give people a rough idea of what the situation is if they wish to continue to defy the court . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #72:4>
A lot of people who turn up at court want to make a protest .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #73:4>
We can advise them how best to do this when they go to court . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #74:4>
A mass rally at Brent Magistrates Court is planned for January 10 when the next round of summoned offenders face the courts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #75:5>
Still barred from committee service
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #76:5>
A BID to end the exile of Labour 's Harshad Barot was scotched by opposition councillors last week .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #77:5>
A move to make the controversial councillor a mem<l>ber of Brent 's personnel committee was defeated by Tor<l>ies and Liberal Democrats at last Tuesday 's policy and resources meeting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #78:5>
It means Cllr Barot will have to wait until the full council meeting on January 30 , when new local Govern<l>ment legislation will enable him to take up committee membership .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #79:5>
Labour leader Cllr Dorman Long says if opposition councillors continued to bar Cllr Barot 's entry on to committees , his party would consider legal action .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #80:5>
The troubled member for St Raphael 's has so far spent eight months in the political wilderness following revelations just before May 's local elections of a convic<l>tion for an attempted home improvement fraud .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #81:5>
He is also currently facing a possible court battle with Brent over allegations that the Brent Asian Profes<l>sionals Association , of which he was chairman , owes the council around &pound-sign;100,000 in rents , storage and legal costs .

Ambulance service in crisis :
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #83:6>
claim
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #84:6>
by Toby Porter
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #85:6>
A FUNDING &ldquo; crisis &rdquo; in the ambulance service is putting lives at risk , a union chief claims .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #86:6>
Cost-cutting has left Wem<l>bley and Harrow with a short<l>age of reliable front-line vehicles and relief crews , says Stan Elson , North West conve<l>nor for the National Union of Public Employees .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #87:6>
A ban on managers at Ken<l>ton , Mill Hill , Wembley , Pinner and Willesden bringing in fitters to carry out essential repairs at weekends was threatening lives , he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #88:6>
Morale had taken a nose-dive which was particularly serious over the Christmas and New Year period .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #89:6>
He said : &rdquo; Often stations have no vehicles at weekends and night cover is diabolical be<l>cause staff are not paid over<l>time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #90:6>
Rotas introduced after the dispute are also falling apart .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #91:6>
&ldquo; The ambulance fleet is too old but there is no prospect of getting any more for at least an<l>other year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #92:6>
Sometimes we just have to sit there unable to help people involved in an accident . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #93:6>
He claimed other problems included : &bullet;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #94:6>
Wembley and Harrow should have 20 relief staff but have only four .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #95:6>
&bullet; From April the service may have to lower standards to com<l>pete with other commpanies for contracts for out-patient trips .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #96:6>
&bullet; The rocketing number of non<l->emergency trips which doctors regard as essential is deepening the crisis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #97:6>
A spokeswoman for the Lon<l>don Ambulance Service ( LAS ) refuted the claim that lives were being put at risk .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #98:6>
She said : &ldquo; We are unaware of any significant problems in the Harrow and Wembley area other than those you would ex<l>pect .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #99:6>
&rdquo; We have 25 per cent more vehicles than we need to fill gaps in the front line , including weekends .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #100:6>
The need for new ve<l>hicles is being re-assessed but we recently reviewed distribu<l>tion to make sure it meets pa<l>tients ' needs . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #101:6>
She added new highly-trained paramedics could take less time on calls because they diagnosed faster .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #102:6>
&rdquo; We have asked doctors to ensure only those in need are given transport , so we have few<l>er non-emergency calls . &ldquo;

Streets sweep nets 68 truants
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #104:7>
by Marcia White
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #105:7>
A SUCCESSFUL crack<l->down on truancy in the borough has prompted edu<l>cation chiefs to seek out the root of the problem .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #106:7>
The joint operation by Wembley and Kilburn police and Brent Council was aimed at reducing truancy and the risk of children being victims or offenders in crimes in the area .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #107:7>
Project Stay at School , a two-week scheme from De<l>cember 3 , ended with 68 child<l>ren being picked up by police on the streets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #108:7>
Of the 13 children , aged be<l>tween six and 16 , picked up in the Kilburn area , two were arrested on theft charges .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #109:7>
Community liaison officer John Hambleton said : &rdquo; The project was very successful and provides further evidence that the police and the local authority are working toge<l>ther on local problems .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #110:7>
&ldquo; A measure of that success was shown when local amuse<l>ment arcades decided not to open because of the lack of children . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #111:7>
Mr Hambleton added that the project may be repeated in the near future .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #112:7>
Specially-trained officers experienced in handling truant children were involved in the project , which targetted high-profile areas like Kil<l>burn and Wembley High Roads .
<ICE-GB:W2C-009 #113:7>
The wayward students were picked up and escorted to the Education Welfare Ser<l>vice office at Chesterfield House , where their details were recorded and arrange<l>ments made for them to re<l>turn to school or their parents ' care .

Secret army 's war on the left
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #2:1>
A crusading judge has gathered a dossier on the Italian wing of Europe 's ultra-right clandestine army with information that could topple the government .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #3:1>
In Rome , William Scobie reports on the bombshells of intrigue that keep exploding across the Continent where the CIA plotted to defend democracy from the Communists .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #4:1>
IN A closely-guarded paramili<l>tary base in the wilds of north<l>ern Sardinia stands a well-worn billiard table which , until last week , bore a shining brass plate : &lsquo; To the men of Gladio - from Giulio Andreotti &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #5:1>
The plate is no more , removed at short notice on orders from its donor , Italy 's Prime Minister .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #6:1>
Suddenly no one wants to know about Gladio , which is the Italian side of the Europe-wide Operation Stay Behind , now revealed as the best-kept , and most damaging , political-military secret since World War II .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #7:1>
It involves the raising , fund<l>ing and training of clandestine forces all over Western Europe from the days of Cold War ten<l>sion , behind the backs of parlia<l>ments and peoples .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #8:1>
Its purpose , a resistance network in the event of Red Army occupation , had long lost validity and this it is said , led to the perversion of a patriotic plan in one country after another by ambitious gen<l>erals and greedy politicians .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #9:1>
Gladio ( from gladium , the short sword used by Roman gladiators ) was first exposed in the Italian parliament amid cries of outrage as it emerged that the underground organisation was the idea of the CIA , which bankrolled the scheme and trained its carefully-picked vol<l>unteers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #10:1>
Only a tiny clique of military intelligence chiefs and right-wing politicians shared the secret .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #11:1>
Training was con<l>ducted under US Green Berets and British experts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #12:1>
Then it was discovered that Stay Behind had been extended beyond its Nato umbrella to neutral Sweden , Austria and Switzerland , where a parliamentary inquiry has begun .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #13:1>
As shock followed shock across the Continent , a Nato spokesman issued a denial :
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #14:1>
nothing was known of Gladio or Stay Behind .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #15:1>
Then a seven-word communique announced the denial was &lsquo; incorrect &rsquo; - and nothing more .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #16:1>
More disclaimers and brush-offs came from Paris , Bonn , Brussels , Washington and London .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #17:1>
But the tide of revelation was flowing too fast :
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #18:1>
Belgian Defence Minister Guy Coeme was first to admit that Gladio was alive and kicking in his country .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #19:1>
In Paris , President Francois Mitterrand admitted that France had maintained a parallel structure , codenamed Glaive ( Sword ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #20:1>
Bonn said that in Germany the CIA-funded Schwert ( Sword again ) contin<l>ued to exist :
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #21:1>
the German press charged that several of its lead<l>ers were ex-Nazis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #22:1>
In many other countries the secret societies have been mori<l>bund , but not in Italy , where all hell broke loose over charges that the CIA had conspired with Italian intelligence chiefs and Christian Democrat leaders to install a military dictatorship on the lines of the CIA-Colonels coup in Greece .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #23:1>
This was to be achieved through a &lsquo; strategy of tension &rsquo; to combat the &lsquo; Red Brigades &rsquo; with bombings and assassina<l>tions on IRA lines .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #24:1>
The purpose was to dishearten the Left and open the way to a takeover .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #25:1>
Indeed , there were atrocities over the decades .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #26:1>
There are charges that these culminated in the kidnapping and execution of former Premier Aldo Moro , whose insistence on defying an American veto on admitting Communists into the Cabinet infuriated Washington .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #27:1>
Defying Andreotti and the Christian Democrat right , Moro was on the way to Parliament with the deal fixed when he was kid<l>napped .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #28:1>
William Colby , CIA chief of the day , claimed recently that his agency had spent nearly $100 million &lsquo; supporting politi<l>cians &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #29:1>
But Moro the loner was not for sale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #30:1>
Meanwhile , the inquiries have shown that Ital<l>ian secret services successfully penetrated the Red Brigades , Moro 's captors .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #31:1>
&lsquo; Poor Moro had to go , &rsquo; says a Communist party MP .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #32:1>
&lsquo; We had 40 per cent of the national vote .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #33:1>
We regarded the Brigades as mad extremists who were destroying the Left .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #34:1>
It was easy to focus Red Brigade fury on Moro for leading the Commu<l>nists into the capitalist camp .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #35:1>
And once the Communists got into the cabinet , they could dis<l>cover Gladio . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #36:1>
That Moro felt certain he was being sacrificed is evident from his last letters .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #37:1>
More facts tumbled out as the row in the Italian parliament continued .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #38:1>
Andreotti said that 139 secret arms dumps had been gathered in over the last decade - but 12 were mysteri<l>ously missing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #39:1>
In the course of training partisans for the War That Never Was , hundreds of men had been flown from Sardi<l>nia to Corsica in blacked-out aircraft .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #40:1>
Andreotti admitted that Gladio , born in 1951 , was still active .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #41:1>
Two Communist MPs got into the secret training base near Alghero , Sardinia , last week and signed their names in a morocco-bound guest-book , within hearing of fusillades from the firing range .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #42:1>
They dis<l>covered that when the Prime Minister had spoken of &lsquo; only 622 units &rsquo; he had failed to men<l>tion that each was a guerrilla chief who would raise 12 to 15 followers to a total of 15,000 men .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #43:1>
After training sessions these Gladio chieftains took their &lsquo; personal weapons &rsquo; home to be ready for the Soviet inva<l>sion .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #44:1>
Democracy had been sub<l>verted , the Left charged , by the CIA in collusion with a right<l->wing clique that included Presi<l>dent Francisco Cossiga .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #45:1>
The 66-year-old President , who was on a state visit to Lon<l>don when the storm broke , responded that he was &lsquo; proud and happy &rsquo; to have done his patriotic bit in being in atten<l>dance , at the Ministry of Defence in the Fifties , during the birth of Gladio .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #46:1>
Amid demands for his resignation and/or impeachment for high treason , he is happy no longer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #47:1>
His political allies , trembling for their seats in next year 's elections , rallied round to turn the heat on a prime source of their troubles , a bold 36-year-old investigating magistrate in Venice , Felice Casson .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #48:1>
The judge , slender and bespectacled , was tenaciously probing neo-fascist bombings in which scores of civilians , police and soldiers were killed .

He winkled out a document dating back to 1959 which referred to Gladio .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #50:1>
Through his insistence , it was produced in parliament .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #51:1>
Attempts were made to disci<l>pline the unruly magistrate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #52:1>
It was too late .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #53:1>
Casson widened his inquiry into Gladio .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #54:1>
Generals , police chiefs and ex-Ministers were questioned , sometimes for hours at a stretch , before leav<l>ing his Grand Canal office in waiting speed-boats .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #55:1>
His request to interview the President himself was angrily refused .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #56:1>
But Cossiga has agreed to say his piece before a Parlia<l>mentary Commission or before a secret service committee with evidence in camera .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #57:1>
Casson says : &lsquo; That is all I wanted - that new light should be shed on these years of lies and mysteries : that Italy should for once know the truth . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #58:1>
Last week he dispatched to Rome , under police guard , photostats of all the evidence he has gath<l>ered .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #59:1>
The 10,000-word dossier , Casson aides say , relates the Gladio set-up to politico<l->military subversion and con<l>tains some explosive material &lsquo; that could topple the govern<l>ment &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #60:1>
A copy goes to the Attorney-General , who can decide on prosecutions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #61:1>
One of Casson 's visitors was former Defence Minister Paolo Taviani , who said frankly that during his time in office ( 1955-58 ) the Italian secret ser<l>vices were bossed and financed by &lsquo; the boys in Via Veneto &rsquo; - ie the CIA agents in the US Embassy in the heart of Rome .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #62:1>
Declassified secret service papers reveal that Ted Shack<l>ley , deputy chief of the CIA sta<l>tion in Rome in the 1970s introduced the notorious Licio Gelli - head of the neo-fascist P2 masonic lodge and for years a fugitive in Argentina - to General Alexander Haig , then Nixon 's chief of staff , and later , from 1974 to ' 79 , Nato Supreme Commander .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #63:1>
P2 was a right-wing shadow government , ready to take over Italy , that included four Cabinet Ministers , all three intelligence chiefs , 48 MPs , 160 military officers , bankers , industrialists , top diplomats and the Army Chief of Staff .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #64:1>
After meetings between Gelli , Italian military brass and CIA men in the embassy , Gladio was given renewed blessing - and more money - by Haig and the then head of the National Security Council , Henry Kissinger .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #65:1>
Just how those and later funds were spent is a key point in the investiga<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #66:1>
Casson 's dossier will be pres<l>ented , along with a large batch of similar evidence compiled by another judge in Rome , to a parliamentary commission on terrorism .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #67:1>
Together , they have revealed a long line of ghosts from Italy 's post-war traumas .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #68:1>
From the seven-hour testi<l>mony from Admiral Fulvio Martini , secret services chief , to parliament last Thursday , it is clear that the Gladio army had been readied since the Fifties not merely to intervene when the Russians came , but also in the case of the Left winning a general election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #69:1>
Italians have also learned that General Giovanni De Lorenzo , as secret service chief , compiled secret dossiers , including tapes and photographs , on some 150,000 people &semi; that his succes<l>sor , General Vito Miceli , received an $800,000 handout from the Americans &semi; that Miceli was linked to an abortive coup in 1970 led by Prince Valerio Borghese , a war-time mini-sub commander .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #70:1>
De Lorenzo and Miceli received parliamentary immunity as MSI ( neo-fascist ) MPs , while Borghese was spir<l>ited out to Spain by ex-Nazis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #71:1>
Gladio investigations are now under way not only in Rome but in Brussels , Geneva and Stras<l>bourg , where the European Parliament last week agreed to set up a commission of inquiry .

Lebanon sets its hopes on the Second Republic
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #74:2>
Beirut
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #75:2>
Julie Flint
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #76:2>
THE most serious attempt to end gun rule since the begin<l>ning of the Lebanese civil war 15 years ago is scheduled to reach first base tomorrow when Beirut and its environs will be declared officially free of mili<l>tias and under the control of a reunited Lebanese army that has , for the first time , the germ of sectarian balance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #77:2>
In the final step towards the creation of this &lsquo; Greater Beirut &rsquo; - a 200-square-mile trial run for peaceful coexistence under Syrian auspices - Lebanese troops were scheduled to begin deploying yesterday in the Shi'ite southern suburbs and the militia heartland of Christian East Beirut .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #78:2>
Last-minute objections raised by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia delayed the start of the deployment , but govern<l>ment sources expressed confi<l>dence that a meeting between the Defence Minister , Albert Mansour , and militia leader Samir Geagea would succeed in ironing out the final problems .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #79:2>
Muslim militias finished withdrawing their heavy weap<l>ons from West Beirut at the start of the week , followed later by the pro-Syrian militias who entered Beirut 's Christian hin<l>terland in the wake of the operation that ousted Gen Michel Aoun last month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #80:2>
The Lebanese Forces , Bei<l>rut 's most powerful militia and traditionally its most anti-Syrian , had pledged not to hand over its key stronghold in East while the pro-Syrians remained poised to fill the void .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #81:2>
The pro-Syrians ' withdrawal removed the last substantial barrier to &lsquo; Great Beirut &rsquo; , whose borders will contain approximately half of Leba<l>non 's total population .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #82:2>
Hopes for peace in Lebanon have never been so high :
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #83:2>
international d&eacute;tente and Syrian determination to prevail in Lebanon , new agreement among the Lebanese on their Arab destiny , the high price of a war that is no longer waged with small arms , and over<l>whelming war-weariness have already forged national and international agreement on a peace plan to rebuild state authority and end the traditional dominance of Leba<l>non 's Maronite Christian community .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #84:2>
The disgust with a war that has taken more than 100,000 lives , mutilated one of the most beautiful landscapes in the region and made international pariahs of an entire population , is a very different mood from that which prevailed when pro-Israelis and pro-Palestinians first crossed swords in 1975 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #85:2>
&lsquo; Everyone was so enthusiastic about the war in 1975 &rsquo; , a polit<l>ician of the day recalls .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #86:2>
&lsquo; Leaders , intellectuals , practically every<l>one said : &ldquo; We have compro<l>mised since 1943 - the year that independent Lebanon guaranteed Maronite suprem<l>acy - without achieving anything .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #87:2>
So let 's have a show<l->down ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #88:2>
let 's resolve it once and for all by military means . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #89:2>
&lsquo; Now the fighters are tired and the civilian population is disgusted .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #90:2>
Everyone has a romantic wish for the state to come back .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #91:2>
They feel even the worst state is better than the best militia . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #92:2>
Two previous attempts to restore state authority ended in failure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-010 #93:2>
The first was immedi<l>ately after the 1975-76 war when , with Palestinian might in Lebanon still immense , Presi<l>dent Sadat 's visit to Jerusalem blew apart the Arab consensus that underpinned the peace .

Killer used knife like a bayonet , court told
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #2:1>
by COURT REPORTER
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #3:1>
A FUN NIGHT at Bridge Park community centre , Stonebridge , ended in horror and bloodshed when long knives were drawn and two men fell clutching horrendous wounds , a jury heard this week .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #4:1>
One died within minutes and the other underwent se<l>ven major operations but still lost his left leg through amputation in hospital , said Mr David Paget , prosecu<l>ting at the Old Bailey .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #5:1>
Trouble flared at Bridge Park after a new group of bouncers were employed to police an event on Saturday September 23 last year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #6:1>
Andrew Marshall , 25 , of Prothero House , Stonebridge , and Samuel Campbell , 28 , of Mordant House , and Courtney Campbell , 25 , of Haskell House , Stonebridge , are in the dock .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #7:1>
They all deny attempting to murder Harry Mundy or wounding him with intent to cause serious bodily harm .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #8:1>
Marshall and Samuel Campbell deny murdering Philip Williams .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #9:1>
Mr Page told the jury the three accused were members of a local group calling themselves The Panthers who regularly carried out security work at the centre and were paid by promoters .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #10:1>
A dance was organised for September 23 but the services of the group were not hired because they were thought to be too expensive .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #11:1>
Instead 12 bouncers from the south London-based Jum<l>bo Defence Force were recruited .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #12:1>
People attending the dance were searched for weapons at the door .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #13:1>
But those who were well-known faces at the club , including the defendants , were not searched .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #14:1>
The jury was told the event went off well and there was no trouble until it was winding up shortly before 3 am .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #15:1>
Marshall and Mundy became involved in a row when Marshall tried to remove a crush barrier at the entrance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #16:1>
He was told to use the normal exit and that caused &ldquo; re<l>sentment and friction &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #17:1>
He drew a knife from the waistband of his trousers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #18:1>
Witnesses described it as being like a bayonet and up to 10in long .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #19:1>
Marshall went for Mundy , who was unarmed , and he was forced to back away as Samuel Campbell also drew a knife in sup<l>port of Marshall , alleged the prosecutor .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #20:1>
When Mundy stumbled over a chair and fell he was attacked by Marshall &ldquo; in a frenzy &rdquo; and stabbed and slashed on the left leg .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #21:1>
Courtney Campbell then used an ashtray to hit the badly injured Mundy over the head a number of times .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #22:1>
Phillip Williams , living in Harlesden with a woman who had once been Marshall 's girlfriend , was at the entrance to the hall when Marshall spotted him and shouted &ldquo; I 've wanted you for a long time , &rdquo; counsel added .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #23:1>
Slashed
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #24:1>
Seconds later Williams was chased , trapped against a wall and slashed and stabbed by Marshall and Samuel Campbell .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #25:1>
He suffered wounds to the back , head and shoulder .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #26:1>
The fatal wound was more than 4 in deep and penetrated the left lung .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #27:1>
Williams staggered across to Sunny Crescent where he fell dying .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #28:1>
The trial continues .

SEVEN MEN CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO SUPPLY CRACK AND COCAINE
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #30:2>
Police smash drugs ring
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #31:2>
SEVEN men have been charged with conspiracy to supply crack and cocaine after a major drugs raid last Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #32:2>
The carefully planned &ldquo; surgical strike &rdquo; on Wembley 's Chalkhill estate , in which a total of 27 people were arrested , has been hailed as a success by the police and community leaders .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #33:2>
The seven , aged between 21 and 28 , are accused of selling the drugs to dealers alleged to operate across the north and west of London and as far away as Berkshire and Hertfordshire .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #34:2>
Forty<l->nine pieces of crack , with a street value of about &pound-sign;1,225 , were also recovered .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #35:2>
Three men have also been charged with supplying heroin and one with possession of cannabis while another man was cau<l>tioned for possession of cannabis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #36:2>
Police have released two women and two men while two men who were found to have over<l>stayed their immingration conditions are being dealt with .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #37:2>
A further eight people are to be interviewed about other crimes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #38:2>
Wembley Ch Supt Eric Brown said the operation would mark the stepping up of a multi-agency drive against drug abuse through the Brent Joint Committee on Drug Misuse .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #39:2>
While councillor Richard Harrod , who has represented the estate on the council for five years , said the community had been pleased to see the police act and regarded it as important that they had worked closely with other agencies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #40:2>
&ldquo; Most community groups were informed just about when the raid was going to take place while letters in all languages about it were put out after .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #41:2>
I also want to make the point that this was just one stairwell ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #42:2>
there are 29 on the estate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #43:2>
The majority of people involved were from outside the estate , an indication that all is not bad on Chalkhill . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #44:2>
Meticulous planning lays the ground work for success of major operation
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #45:2>
by WILL CONROY
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #46:2>
IT WAS just seconds from the hit and the detective 's tense eyes tracked his sus<l>pects across the stairwell .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #47:2>
He had every confidence in his men , but who knows , when dealing with the brutal world of drug dealing , things can go wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #48:2>
In the control room he and collea<l>gues had been preparing the raid since 7.30 am .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #49:2>
Officers had been posted to watch the suspects arriving on their patch by the entrance of the C4 and C5 blocks of Wem<l>bley 's Chalkhill housing estate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #50:2>
From their vantage point they had seen the same routine month after month , as the community , gradually facing up to what was happening to their estate , asked &ldquo; When are you going to do something ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #51:2>
Speaking prior to the raid Wem<l>bley Supt John Slater : &ldquo; It was get<l>ting almost embarrassing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #52:2>
Residents associations , the housing department of the council , councillors , local MPs have all brought this to our attention .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #53:2>
But it has to be a sensitive operation ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #54:2>
we will not go in smashing in doors .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #55:2>
If we did this operation any quicker or cheaper , it could cause a large rift with the community that might take many months or years to heal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #56:2>
&ldquo; We have called this investiga<l>tion Operation Still because quite early on we realised that after it is all over residents have still got to live there and we have still got to police it . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #57:2>
With each block of the estate linked from one end to the other by walkways , Chalkhill is made for escape .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #58:2>
Forty detectives and uni<l>formed officers poised in five &lsquo; Eagle &rsquo; units , non-police vehicles such as British Telecom vans parked in streets around the estate , had been given the task of blocking off each passage way .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #59:2>
A firearms unit was also posi<l>tioned nearby along with a dog handling unit .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #60:2>
One of the suspects was known to have a ferocious pitbull terrier which had killed other dogs on the estate but in the event this man did not turn up .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #61:2>
Over at Area Seven police head<l>quarters , Kingsbury , 125 officers from territorial support groups across west London had only now been briefed on why they had been brought together .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #62:2>
A convoy of 23 vehicles would bring them to the estate to meet any public disorder as soon as the round-up was made .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #63:2>
At around 4 pm the word in the control room was that the main forces had now arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #64:2>
The Eagle units slipped into position and over the radio came the words &ldquo; Attack , attack , attack &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #65:2>
As hoped the arrests took just 20 seconds and the massive police pre<l>sence was all there was to see .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #66:2>
The confused silence was mo<l>mentarily broken as a suspect was wrestled to the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #67:2>
Some friends shouted hysterically but the general mood was echoed by 59-year-old caretaker Rupert Jones :
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #68:2>
&ldquo; I have been clearing up around these people for a long time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #69:2>
I am pleased to see the police .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #70:2>
I have no kids but I know all the kids around here .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #71:2>
With these things over the last months I was afraid for them . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #72:2>
A group of between 10 and 20 youths stood jibing at the police activities .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #73:2>
A 23-year-old said it was all a waste of taxpayers ' money .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #74:2>
&ldquo; This is just some public stance by the police ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #75:2>
they just do not like us black folks around here .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #76:2>
I have lived here eight or nine years and I would know if there was crack .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #77:2>
We live here and they have no right to move us along . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #78:2>
But police were busy handing out letters about the operation to re<l>sidents and Supt Slater was happy with the result .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #79:2>
&ldquo; My main concern now is to get through to the com<l>munity what we have done and why we have done it . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #80:2>
&lsquo; Very few local people involved &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #81:2>
POLICE allege that after similar raids on crack gangs across estates in west and south London in May remain<l>ing members of a drugs ring then moved to Chalkhill .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #82:2>
Since June , dealers from across north and west London and as far away as Bracknell , Berkshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire have regarded Chalkhill as the place to buy their cocaine and crack for their own mar<l>kets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #83:2>
The crack was made in flats and squats on Chalkhill occupied by the dealers , say police .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #84:2>
Very few people originally from the estate are involved in the drugs ring or are users , they add .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #85:2>
The police operation was headed by Wembley CID with assistance from the police Area Seven drugs squad and the anti-crack unit of Scotland Yard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #86:2>
Intelligence gathering - the gathering and processing of every scrap of information from hearsay to concrete information - started in June and then followed eight weeks of evidence-gathering before the raid .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #87:2>
Police will maintain a greater presence on the estate for the coming weeks to make sure no drug dealing re<l->emerges .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #88:2>
Pressure on Brent Council to install more concierge systems in the blocks to prevent the estate remaining the ideal habitat for dealers will be maintained .

Residents win first stage of battle to halt development
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #90:3>
by JENNIE WALSH
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #91:3>
ESTATE residents have won the first stage of their battle to stop developers de<l>molishing family houses and building flats .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #92:3>
The battle was taken to the High Court Lands Tribunal by Jenshir Developments Ltd in an attempt to get the go<l->ahead to build a three-story retirement home on land occupied by three adjacent houses in Salmon Street on the Kingsbury Hill estate , Kingsbury .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #93:3>
But the builder 's decision back-fired when residents , using a little known device , showed Jenshir 's plans were unlawful .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #94:3>
At a preliminary hearing last Friday Judge Marder found that a covenant attached to the estate when it was built in 1923 by C W B Sim<l>mons , Cricklewood builder , limits development to a single house per plot .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #95:3>
The judge said the Jenshir development plans would be in breach of the covenant , despite the fact that they had been granted planning permission by Brent Council in 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #96:3>
It is antici<l>pated a final decision will be made in the New Year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #97:3>
Victor Mishiku of the Covenant Movement in Ealing , which advised the residents , said : &ldquo; This is proof that people fighting develo<l>pers shouldn't rely on plans alone but not many people know about the covenant tactic . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #98:3>
Eddie Gibson , who has lived on the estate for more than 20 years and is a coordinator of the residents ' fight , said everyone was delighted with the decision .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #99:3>
He wrote to Prince Charles and Margaret Thatcher as part of the campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #100:3>
&ldquo; I believe that when people pur<l>chase a home , they also buy the environment and no one has the right to bulldoze it , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #101:3>
&ldquo; This is one of the nicest parts of Kingsbury and thankfully Mr Simmons had the foresight to add the covenant when he built the houses . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #102:3>
Brent councillor Bill Duffin who followed the case closely said that he was particularly delighted with the judge 's decision .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #103:3>
&ldquo; Planning permission was given by the council against the advice of the planning officers and this is just one of the many bad decisions made by that committee that we are currently looking into , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-011 #104:3>
And he believes that a precedent has now been set to keep out back door developers .

THE FOREIGN Office has warned Brit<l>ons not to visit 26 countries until hostil<l>ities in the Gulf cease .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #3:1>
Anyone who intends to travel to sen<l>sitive regions may find it difficult to take out new life cover or to claim on existing non-life insurance policies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #4:1>
But the Association of British Insur<l>ers said present life and pensions poli<l>cies of people involved in the conflict will not be affected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #5:1>
This is because nearly all British life or pensions policies do not include a war risk exclusion , so any claims should be met in full .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #6:1>
But non-life poli<l>cies - such as personal accident , legal expenses and medical insurance - do tend to have war risks exclusions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #7:1>
The concern for most people is the danger of terrorist activities breaking out on the British mainland .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #8:1>
Most Brit<l>ish non-life insurance policies do not carry an exclusion for terrorist inci<l>dents , so policies should pay up for injury or damage caused by terrorist activity .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #9:1>
But a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said : &ldquo; This is the most difficult situation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #10:1>
&ldquo; For example , if there was an explo<l>sion in central London , the insurers may not pay out for damage to property if they can directly link it to the war in any way :
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #11:1>
it would then be subject to the war risk exclusion . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #12:1>
Most travel companies have can<l>celled holidays to sensitive areas and people intending to travel indepen<l>dently to the 26 countries that the For<l>eign Office has advised British nation<l>als not to visit will find it hard to get travel insurance .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #13:1>
Edwin Bassett , managing director of NatWest insurance brokers added : &ldquo; If people with existing policies are intending to go to risk areas , their insurers may question the circum<l>stances and there may not be any cover .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #14:1>
We are advising anyone affected to con<l>tact their insurers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #15:1>
&ldquo; Expatriates in risk areas may find that their sickness and accident insur<l>ance will not cover them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #16:1>
The same may apply to permanent health insur<l>ance , and disability is unlikely to pay out . &rdquo;

Protect and survive policy best option for investors
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #20:2>
Investors considering strategies during the Gulf War hostilities have few parallels to draw on from past conflicts , experts claim .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #21:2>
Nick Knight , equity strate<l>gist for the Nomura Research Institute , said the closest com<l>parison is the period 1979-80 when there was a revolution in Iran followed by the taking of American hostages and war in Afghanistan between Iran and Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #22:2>
Mr Knight said : &ldquo; Most people would insist that this dispute is bigger .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #23:2>
One should be risk averse , but it does look as if these current markets are reasonably well-supported by low-levels of valuations and things would have to be dra<l>matically worse to say you should not dip a toe into the markets . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #24:2>
Allan Chase , head of strage<l>tic exposure for NatWest Bank , can see no comparisons with either the Falklands con<l>flict or Vietnam war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #25:2>
Mr Chase said the major dif<l>ference is the potential impact on world oil supplies and prices and world trade .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #26:2>
The only comparison was the use of the United States dollar as a &ldquo; safe haven &rdquo; immediately following the escalation of fighting last Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #27:2>
Mr Chase said : &ldquo; An investor needs to be very cautious and look to the long-term issues rather than shorter-terms results .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #28:2>
Those going in now should be willing to ride out any dramatic events .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #29:2>
An investor should look to protect what they have got and try not to make any money out of the war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #30:2>
We are advising people to be cautious as this is a situa<l>tion we have not seen before . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #31:2>
John Korwin-Szymanowski , senior analyst with S G War<l>burg , added : &ldquo; Stock markets will go up and down according to the news of how the war is going .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #32:2>
&ldquo; There is no reason for unit or investment trust investors to sell because their fund man<l>ager is looking after the asset for you . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #33:2>
Peter Walls , investment trust analyst for Laing &ampersand; Cruickshank , believes its status as a United Nations sanctioned conflict and poten<l>tial impact on world oil sup<l>plies and trade makes it a unique conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #34:2>
Mr Walls advises investors tempted into equities to take shelter in quality stock .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #35:2>
Richard Eats , managing director of GT Unit Managers , also believes the conflict has no historical comparisons but urges investors to look through to the end of the war and likely rise in the markets .

Shares end in state of uneasy calm
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #38:3>
THE MARKET
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #39:3>
By Norman Whetnall
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #40:3>
LONDON shares closed in an atmosphere of &ldquo; uneasy calm &rdquo; awaiting events in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #41:3>
Yesterday 's morning session saw some nervous selling on fears of Israeli involvement in the hostilities -
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #42:3>
the &ldquo; Footsie &rdquo; was 17.6 down at noon .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #43:3>
However , subsequent feel<l>ings that the government in Tel Aviv will not retaliate pending further allied strikes against Iraq 's missile launch<l>ers proved reassuring and the market rallied .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #44:3>
A fairly stable opening on Wall Street helped things at the close and the main Index closed only 1.9 easier on bal<l>ance at 2102.7 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #45:3>
The narrower<l->based FT 30 Share Index ended 5.3 up at 1654.9 , after 1640.5 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #46:3>
Gilts ran into profit-taking following Thursday 's strong advance , but buyers were quick to take advantage of early losses and a futures-inspired squeeze left values with net gains of up to &pound-sign;1/2 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #47:3>
The appearance of the new &ldquo; tap &rdquo; , a &pound-sign;500m further tranche further tranche of Con<l>version 10 p.c. , 1996 , did no damage to the market 's final strong tone .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #48:3>
Oil shares remained dull , with Enterprise , 15 down at 519p , bearing the brunt of fur<l>ther selling .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #49:3>
The market here has been undermined by fears that Elf Aquitaine , at present involved in a Spanish acquisi<l>tion , could be a seller of its 25 p.c. stake .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #50:3>
However , sources close to both companies reckon that Elf has no intention of selling a stock with such longer term potential .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #51:3>
Nomura 's Allan Marshall believes that Enterprise shares , backed by a net asset value of 650p , should be bought for recovery .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #52:3>
Lasmo ended 13 down at 331p , and British Petroleum 5 easier at 304p , after 301p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #53:3>
Market men said that the irony is that shares prices are now significantly below pre-Kuwait invasion levels and yet the majors have enjoyed inflated cash flow since August and the crude price is still about $1 higher than it was at the time of the initial Iraqi strike .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #54:3>
Dealers in Hillsdown were at sixes and sevens as Hoare Go<l>vett placed 5m shares at around 195p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #55:3>
There was immediate chatter that sale could have been part of the Kuwait Investment Office 's 3.16 p.c. holding in the com<l>pany , although close followers of the stock described this as &ldquo; idle gossip &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #56:3>
The shares closed at a new low , 14 down at 196p , taking the honours as the day 's most active stock with nearly 13m traded .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #57:3>
Some analysts sug<l>gested that they were looking oversold .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #58:3>
A trade magazine report about major problems in George Wimpey 's United States operations came at a time when a line of 3m shares was said to be looking for a new home .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #59:3>
In the event , there was a nervous mark-down of 20 to 174p , but only 636,000 shares were traded .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #60:3>
The always volatile market in Glaxo was unsettled by sug<l>gestions that the UK drug authorities had asked for more data on the company 's anti-mi<l>graine drug , Imigran .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #61:3>
Some speculators suggested that , if true , this could have implications for the timing of the Imigran 's approval .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #62:3>
In the event , there was a reaction of 28 to 827p in the share price .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #63:3>
Electricity and water stocks ended the day in good form .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #64:3>
South Wales , at 173p , and South West , at 157p , were both sparking with gains of 7p , while Manweb improved 5 to 173p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #65:3>
Thames Water gained 6 to 270p , while the Package Units ended &pound-sign;38 higher at &pound-sign;2,658 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #66:3>
Small scattered offerings had out-of-proportion effect on a thin and sensitive gold share market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #67:3>
St. Helena dropped 42 to 399p and Driefontein 25 to 551p , while Freegold , at 414p , and Welkom , at 269p , both closed about 12 down .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #68:3>
Long-suffering holders in Ferranti International saw the shares sink to a new low of 9 1/2p as a line of 3.5m went through at 8 1/2p in what seemed to be a bed and breakfast deal -
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #69:3>
the final quote was 1 easier on bal<l>ance at 11p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #70:3>
Still overshadowed by down<l->gradings and the &ldquo; Gulf effect &rdquo; on the hotels business , Lad<l>broke Group eased afresh to 222p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #71:3>
However , yesterday the shares gained a supporter in Jeffrey Harwood of UBS Phillips &ampersand; Drew who said that the current level discounts the worst scenario in the hotels and property divisions and that he expects a strong share price bounce when the Gulf crisis is resolved .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #72:3>
Shares of the footwear and fabrics company , Headlam Group , hardened to 39p on the news that Futura Holdings had increased its stake to 19.77 p.c. of the equity .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #73:3>
There has been recurring speculation that Futura could be planning a full-scale bid for Headlam and the latter 's direc<l>tors repeated last October 's statement that they have not been informed of Futura 's intentions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #74:3>
ML Laboratories , whose shares in December moved up from the third market to the USM , rallied 22 to 243p after news of promotion to the FT All-share Index .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #75:3>
This pharma<l>ceutical products developer is believed to be making further progress in the development of its main product , glucose poly<l>mer for use in the treatment of kidney failure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #76:3>
Hopes of encouraging news on the refinancing of Austra<l>lia 's News Corporation left the shares a shade firmer at 179p , while the United Kingdom sub<l>sidiary , News International rallied 5 more to 95p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #77:3>
Pearson , where News Corpo<l>ration has all p.c. stake , eased to 607p .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #78:4>
Reality as euphoria starts to evaporate
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #79:4>
Reports of the Allies ' ini<l>tial success in the Gulf caused individual investors to return to the stock market in force for the first time in months this week but the need for caution was underlined when euphoria and share prices subsided yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #80:4>
Regular savings schemes , offered by most investment trusts and many unit trusts , are the best bet in current mar<l>ket conditions for investors who fear bad news could knock confidence further but who remain convinced that equities are the best long-term store of value .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #81:4>
Bad timing is a big worry in volatile markets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #82:4>
Savers who stayed in cash for months before reinvesting a lump sum in shares or unit trusts one day take the risk that prices may plummet the day after .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #83:4>
Fidelity Investments and Schroder Unit Trusts are among fund managers seeking to attract savers back into equity-based investments by diminishing the risks of pick<l>ing the wrong day to take the plunge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #84:4>
Fidelity which manages &pound-sign;1.6 bill billion billion for 200,000 unit holders , is offering a Personal Equity Plan ( Pep ) phased investment programme allowing invest<l>ments to be spread over six or 12 months while earning tax-free interest on that part of the Pep that remains in cash dur<l>ing the period .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #85:4>
Executive director Mary Blair said : &ldquo; Sales of units on Thursday were five times as high as the recent daily aver<l>age - but we are not encourag<l>ing people to put all their mon<l>ey in at one go .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #86:4>
&ldquo; The market has reacted to good news but , over the period of the conflict , something awful could happen and the market might react downwards . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #87:4>
The minimum investment in the Fidelity phased Pep is &pound-sign;3,000 but Schroder , which manages &pound-sign;1.1 billion billion for 23,000 unit holders , is deliberately avoiding Peps and high mini<l>mum investments in its new marketing campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #88:4>
It aims to encourage building society depositors - whose savings far outweigh total investment in units - to switch some of their money into units , perhaps just withdrawing interest earned and investing it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #89:4>
Deputy managing director Rod Duncan said : &ldquo; I spent 13 years working in building soci<l>eties , trying to persuade people to keep their money on deposit and out of unit trusts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #90:4>
&ldquo; I know that one of the big reasons people avoid unit trusts is that they are seen as complex - so we wanted to keep things as simple as possi<l>ble which meant leaving out Peps . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-012 #91:4>
Managing director Clive Boothman said : &rdquo; Building society savers are sceptical of attempts to persuade them to entrust all their savings to the ups and downs of equity investment .

Dealers batten down the hatches by Peter Oborne
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #2:1>
THERE was a mood of numbness and unreality in financial mar<l>kets today as the Gulf deadline passed and dealers awaited the outbreak of war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #3:1>
In London the share market did not duplicate the sharp 700-point fall in the Nikkei Dow in Tokyo but shares were marked down in extremely narrow trading with the FT-SE 100 index off around 18 points .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #4:1>
The oil price continued to crawl up and Brent crude for March de<l>livery was $1 higher than yesterday 's closing level at $29.25 a barrel .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #5:1>
Perhaps the most active market was gold bullion which at last started to reflect the troubled times and advanced $6 to breach the $400 barrier at $403.50 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #6:1>
Deal<l>ers said the rise had taken place in active trading in the Far East .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #7:1>
There was near total inactivity in currency markets despite the fact that London 's leading foreign exchange houses manned their desks from 4.30 am with some staying open all night .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #8:1>
These pre<l>cautions proved unnecessary for today .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #9:1>
Richard Hill , a senior manager on the foreign desk at Barclays , said : &ldquo; It was very very quiet .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #10:1>
There was a little dealing but nothing awe<l->inspiring . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #11:1>
Hill reckoned that the &ldquo; majority of the market &rdquo; had been open early this morning , with many traders believed to be under in<l>structions to sell the dollar in the event of a 12th hour peace move .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #12:1>
He said : &ldquo; People are reluctant to get overexposed in this situa<l>tion . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #13:1>
One dealer said : &ldquo; Even as late as yesterday I suppose the market had a 90% belief in war .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #14:1>
That 10% of optimism has now been stamped out . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #15:1>
He described the mood as &ldquo; som<l>bre , numbed , humbling .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #16:1>
You cannot know what to do until it hap<l>pens &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #17:1>
Interest rates hardened and three-month money rose to stand at 14% , the highest since Britain entered the Exchange Rate Mech<l>anism .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #18:1>
Dealers are ruling out in<l>terest rate cuts until the war is over .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #19:1>
Economist John Kendall at Bar<l>ing Brothers said : &ldquo; The people who get this right are those who can assess the information when war breaks out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #20:1>
If it 's a short , sharp war financial markets will quickly recover their confidence , attention will start to focus on falling interest rates and the eco<l>nomic problems again . &rdquo;

<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #23:2>
A WORRYING state of suspended animation has gripped the Lon<l>don equity market in the build<l>up to a war in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #24:2>
It may be a minor event compared with the real thing in the Middle East , but for the City the near collapse of business represents an impending crisis that brokers will ig<l>nore at their peril .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #25:2>
Turnover in recent weeks has come close to a standstill and so far this year has not approached the 500 million-a-day shares traded which is reckoned to be needed for securities houses to break even .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #26:2>
In fact it has come nowhere near it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #27:2>
Last week , the daily volume of equity trades peaked at 381 million and on Mon<l>day this week it had sunk to 267 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #28:2>
Yesterday it recovered to a paltry 281 million and throughout December it rose above 500 million shares a day on only five occasions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #29:2>
In current conditions , market makers are keeping their books completely flat , reluctant to take on stock from sellers in case the market plunges .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #30:2>
The last thing they need is surplus stock in a falling market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #31:2>
In these sensitive times , even buyers are unwelcome in case , by some miracle , peace breaks out and a short po<l>sition has to be filled in at a higher price .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #32:2>
So far , though , the impact on the City broking houses has been surprisingly small .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #33:2>
Some people have left in dribs and drabs but there has not been anything like the mass cuts which some had pre<l>dicted .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #34:2>
But Warburg Securities let go 36 back office staff last Friday in very low-key fashion and bosses of other securities houses are warning those in the front to shape-up or ship-out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #35:2>
Brokers may still feel that they are keeping their market share , but it is the ever-shrinking size of trade that is of growing concern .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #36:2>
At the same time , declining volume is coupled with continuing excess market capacity , intensifying competition and the knowledge that basic overheads re<l>main high .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #37:2>
For many , especially those who paid so dearly to get into the City near Big Bang , it is a combination that cannot be en<l>dured for ever and will bring nearer the likelihood of retrenchment and job losses .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #38:2>
&square; ONE man in particular who will be disturbed by events in the Gulf is Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corpora<l>tion remains deeply embroiled in a A$8 billion ( &pound-sign;3.25 billion ) debt reconstruction .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #39:2>
Investors are getting increasingly nervous about Murdoch , and News shares have tumbled to their lowest for six years .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #40:2>
Overnight in Australia , the shares slid to A$3.30 and have now come down from last year 's peak of A$14.50 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #41:2>
The main worry is that a number of banks are reluctant to join the recon<l>struction plan and Murdoch has indicated that the company will not be able to meet its obligations later this year unless the deal is put in place .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #42:2>
But events in the Gulf are likely to make the world 's banks even more nerv<l>ous about increasing their lending .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #43:2>
Mur<l>doch may yet be forced to make major as<l>set sales or revise his refinancing package to get off the hook .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #44:3>
Europe dodges the credit rating knife by Amanda McCrystal
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #45:3>
ONE glimmer of hope in the world of credit downgradings is that Europe is unlikely to get as bad as the United States .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #46:3>
There have been notable down-gradings for some European compa<l>nies -
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #47:3>
last week Lord Alexander 's National Westminster Bank had its long-term debt sliced from triple-A to AA plus .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #48:3>
But they are small fry compared with the number of US corporates who have suffered the ignominy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #49:3>
Last year was one of the most de<l>pressing on record for the US corporate sector , which saw its credit-worthiness plummet to alarming new lows .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #50:3>
The most eye-catching statistic given by US credit-rating agency Standard &ampersand; Poor 's in its Credit<l>week magazine , is the volume of downgrades , which came to $510.1 billion ( &pound-sign;268 billion ) last year , nearly treble the $174.4 billion in 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #51:3>
A total of 768 credit quality ratings were lowered last year , substantially higher than the record level of 419 in 1989 as deteriorating economic con<l>ditions played havoc with compa<l>nies and institutions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #52:3>
Financial institutions were the worst affected , with the number of downgrades in that sector soaring to 411 in 1990 from 149 in 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #53:3>
But S&ampersand;P says that Europe won't suffer to the same extent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #54:3>
&ldquo; From a European perspective , while we see some pressure we don't see a huge number of downgrad<l>ings , &rdquo; says S&ampersand;P 's analyst , Barry Hancock .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #55:3>
It has to be said that some of the reason for this is that S&ampersand;P rate only the top tier of companies in Europe , so the highly publicised troubles that have hit smaller companies don't show in the European statis<l>tics , while they will have been a ma<l>jor factor behind the increase in the US downgradings .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #56:3>
But despite this , Hancock does not think Europe will follow the way led by America .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #57:3>
&ldquo; Europe should be relatively sta<l>ble because the economic environ<l>ment isn't so harsh and because the companies we rate are less suscepti<l>ble to a downturn , &rdquo; he says .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #58:3>
&ldquo; Having said that , some of the greatest stresses are coming in the UK and Scandinavia . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #59:3>
While the pressures in Europe will continue , the number of downgrad<l>ings will be relatively stable com<l>pared with those in the United States this year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #60:3>
But it does not look as if the worst is over yet for American companies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #61:3>
&ldquo; We are not seeing any reduction in the amount of downgrading activity , &rdquo; he says .

Murdoch faces new debt crisis by Kirstie Hamilton
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #63:4>
SHARES in Rupert Murdoch 's media com<l>bine News Corporation plunged to yet an<l>other new low on the Australian market to<l>day as Moody 's Investors Service down<l>graded the group 's debt and News Corp journalists walked out on strike .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #64:4>
Moody 's has cut the credit rating on US$1.7 billion ( &pound-sign;890 million ) of subordi<l>nated debt at 20th Century Fox , part of the News Corp empire , from a rating of B3 to Caa .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #65:4>
Journalists on News Corp 's Australian papers have begun a 24-hour strike in pro<l>test at the sacking of 14 reporters at The Australian newspaper .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #66:4>
News Corp shares fell 50 cents to trade at just A$3.30 in Australia overnight , making a drop of A$1.68 so far this week .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #67:4>
The latest round of panic over News Corp was triggered by papers filed with the US authorities in which News Corp admits it will be unable to meet its financial commit<l>ments in June this year unless a refinanc<l>ing package can be agreed with its bankers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #68:4>
News Corp , which owns a whole clutch of British papers including The Times , The Sun and News of the World , needs to have agreement from all its 113 bankers to repackage its &pound-sign;3.8 billion of debt .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #69:4>
Falling advertising revenues caused by the recession in the group 's major markets - British , the US and Australia - have made negotiations even more difficult .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #70:4>
And although the Gulf crisis may have at<l>tracted more newspaper readers around the world , it has caused problems for other parts of the News Corp empire .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #71:4>
Ansett , the airline group jointly owned by News Corp and transport group TNT , is suffering badly from the combination of recession and higher oil prices .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #72:4>
TNT 's share price has also taken a batter<l>ing on the Australian market as these prob<l>lems emerged .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #73:4>
Today the shares fell another 22 Aus<l>sie cents to a new low of 75 cents in heavy turnover .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #74:4>
Like News Corp , TNT 's debts are uncomfortably high .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #75:4>
Unlike News Corp , however , TNT has not indi<l>cated that it will have trou<l>ble meeting its commit<l>ments over the coming year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #76:4>
Many analysts are con<l>vinced that News Corp will be able to fight its way out of its current problems by convincing the banks that its assets will be worth far less if they are offered for sale by a receiver .

First Leisure in the money by Tim Blackstone
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #78:5>
IF 81-YEAR-old chairman of First Leisure , Ber<l>nard Delfont , could blow away the smell of de<l>pression he would do it with one puff of his ci<l>gar .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #79:5>
He tapped his way out of the 1930's slump with brother Lou Grade to the strains of Come and Dance and We 're in the Money , and his com<l>pany now looks most likely to do it again to the same refrains .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #80:5>
With the help of a &pound-sign;30.7 million rights issue last July , the company was only 17% geared at the year-end and about &pound-sign;3.5 million will be shaved off its interest bill in the current year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #81:5>
Profits for the year to 31 October jumped 16% to &pound-sign;29.2 million and at the operating level were up a handsome 24% at &pound-sign;34.2 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #82:5>
The result , says Delfont , &ldquo; demonstrates the fundamental strength of the company and the resilience of the quality driven mass-market lei<l>sure business , given the difficult economic con<l>ditions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #83:5>
&ldquo; Unless there is a swift change in economic conditions , leading to an improvement in confi<l>dence and consumer spending , I expect the ad<l>verse trading climate to prevail throughout the year . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #84:5>
His chief executive John Conlan said the com<l>pany was first struck by the recession in July , a year after the retailers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #85:5>
&ldquo; We are always last to suffer and first to gain on the upturn , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #86:5>
So far trading in the current year is not down on last year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #87:5>
&ldquo; It is going to be hard but we are in a much stronger position than others , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #88:5>
Profits from dancehalls and discos made the biggest contribution with the Empire Leicester Square still packing them in .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #89:5>
New in investment at Milton Keynes , Croydon and Manchester helped profits up from &pound-sign;30.3 million to &pound-sign;38.5 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #90:5>
Sports , largely ten pin bowling , marinas and snooker , made &pound-sign;21.8 million against &pound-sign;17.3 million last time and resorts - meaning Blackpool - made &pound-sign;38.7 million , up from &pound-sign;37.3 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #91:5>
The company provided &pound-sign;1.8 million in capital<l>ised interest supported by a capital investment programme of &pound-sign;60 million .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #92:5>
Analysts are united in extolling First Leisure as the sector 's blue chip and the share price proves it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #93:5>
At 192p the rating is in line with the rest of the market against a sector underper<l>formance of 30% .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #94:5>
Nigel Hicks of Panmure Gordon reckons First Leisure will make around &pound-sign;34 million in the cur<l>rent year and says the shares should be bought on weakness .
<ICE-GB:W2C-013 #95:5>
The company has raised the dividend by 38% to 5.05p in total , including a final of 3.5p , as it promised on the rights issue .

Salako expects to finish the job
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #2:1>
MICHAEL HART on the hero who kept Palace 's hopes alive with his late , late wonder goal
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #3:1>
HAVING scored the unlikeliest goal of the season , John Salako is con<l>vinced that Crys<l>tal Palace can at last re<l>move Brian Clough 's Not<l>tingham Forest from the FA Cup and secure a fourth round tie at New<l>castle next Monday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #4:1>
Salako 's dramatic equal<l>iser in the last minute of ex<l>tra time earned Palace a 2-2 draw in their twice post<l>poned third round replay to set up a potential thriller back at the City Ground on Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #5:1>
Steve Coppell , manager of last season 's beaten FA Cup finalists , had resigned him<l>self to a miserable journey back to London when Salako salvaged Palace 's hopes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #6:1>
Even Salako , a bubbly 21-year-old Nigerian midfield player with an abundance of confidence , was having doubts when Forest 's goal<l>keeper Mark Crossley raced from his goal and sliced a clearance that swerved out to Palace 's left wing on the halfway line .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #7:1>
A careless back pass from Roy Keane had forced Cross<l>ley to race Palace 's Mark Bright for the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #8:1>
&ldquo; I had just looked at the clock and realised that we had played 29 minutes of ex<l>tra time , &rdquo; explained Salako .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #9:1>
&ldquo; I thought it was all over .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #10:1>
&ldquo; When the ball suddenly came to me I realised the keeper was well off his line .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #11:1>
So I just gave it a big kick back towards the goal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #12:1>
It was one of those you hit and hope .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #13:1>
&ldquo; I didn't know whether it would go in .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #14:1>
I thought it might fly wide or the keeper might get back in time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #15:1>
&ldquo; I couldn't believe it when it went in .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #16:1>
All the other play<l>ers mobbed me .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #17:1>
&ldquo; But it won't mean any<l>thing unless we give it 100 per cent again on Thursday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #18:1>
We 've got to come back and finish the job - and I think we can do it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #19:1>
&ldquo; It was important that we got a good result after losing badly on Saturday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #20:1>
It will do wonders for the team 's mo<l>rale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #21:1>
&ldquo; Forest will be the favour<l>ites again but we 're at our best when we 're the under<l>dogs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #22:1>
We don't give up easi<l>ly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #23:1>
&ldquo; I learned last season not to give up until the final whistle .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #24:1>
I remember being 3-2 down to Liverpool in the semi-final .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #25:1>
I thought it was over for us but it wasn't . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #26:1>
Salako 's extraordinary goal was just reward for a Palace side that had worked diligently , if unspectacular<l>ly , to retain an interest in the FA Cup .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #27:1>
It was the fifth goal of the season for Salako , who re<l>cently signed a four-year contract at Selhurst Park .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #28:1>
Last season , he was on loan to Swansea , for whom he played in the European Cup .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #29:1>
&ldquo; He played in the FA Cup final last season and sud<l>denly it 's all happening for him , &rdquo; said Coppell .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #30:1>
&ldquo; He has tremendous athletic ability and good ball control and could have a big future in the game . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #31:1>
Salako 's joy was , of course , Crossley 's despair .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #32:1>
&ldquo; I knew the back pass from Roy Keane would be short and I realised I would have to get out of the penalty area to reach it , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #33:1>
&ldquo; It wasn't a perfect kick but the ball reached the half<l>way line and I thought that would be good enough .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #34:1>
But it wasn't . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #35:1>
Crossley made a string of fine saves from Ian Wright and pulled off what looked to be the crucial save of the night when he blocked a tre<l>mendous shot from Mark Bright 20 minutes into extra time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #36:1>
There was little he could have done , though , about Wright 's volley from Salako 's cross that gave Pal<l>ace the lead in the 53rd minute .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #37:1>
Forest 's equaliser in the 75th minute had an element of good fortune , Terry Wilson 's drive spinning off defender Richard Shaw and looping over goalkeeper Nigel Martyn into the net .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #38:1>
But there was nothing for<l>tunate about the goal that put Forest ahead in the sixth minute of extra time .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #39:1>
Eng<l>land left-back Stuart Pearce , having beaten Wright to the ball , went on a surging run into the heart of the Palace defence .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #40:1>
He played a short pass to Nigel Clough , who with his customary aplomb lifted the ball onto the head of Steve Hodge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #41:1>
Pearce had powered into the penalty area and ran onto the headed pass from Hodge , lifting the ball over Martyn with the outside of his left boot .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #42:1>
It was a classic goal , nearly good enough to clinch this prolonged third round duel .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #43:1>
&ldquo; I think it would have been undeserved had we gone out , &rdquo; said Coppell .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #44:1>
&ldquo; I thought we deserved a draw .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #45:1>
&ldquo; We nearly threw it away because , having taken the lead , we were content to sit back and we handed the ini<l>tiative to Forest . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #46:1>
Clough , who has never won the FA Cup in a distin<l>guished 25-year managerial career , described Salako 's goal as bizarre .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #47:1>
&ldquo; What I 've learned is that you get noth<l>ing in this business until the final whistle , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #48:2>
Clark finds small consolation
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #49:2>
STEVE STAMMERS on the defeat that could be a blessing in disguise for Orient 's youngsters
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #50:2>
THERE were contrasting for<l>tunes for two highly-rated members of the Leyton Ori<l>ent side that gave Swindon a mighty scare before going out of the FA Cup .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #51:2>
Adrian Whitbread , aged 19 , spent the night in a Wilt<l>shire hospital with concus<l>sion and a very sore tongue after a second-half collision .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #52:2>
It was feared that Whit<l>bread , who has been checked out as England Under-21 ma<l>terial , had swallowed his tongue but it emerged later that he had bitten it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #53:2>
Orient manager Frank Clark , who praised the work of physio<l>therapist Bernie Dixon , will take medical advice before deciding when Whitbread can be included in his team plans again .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #54:2>
He may soon have to make another decision about the future of goalkeeper Paul Heald .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #55:2>
The 22-year-old has al<l>ready attracted two rejected bids of around &pound-sign;300,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #56:2>
Now Scottish Premier League club Hibernian , with &pound-sign;350,000 in the bank from the sale of Paul Kane to Oldham , have become the latest club to check out the goalkeeper who cost a mere &pound-sign;2,500 when signed from Sheffield Unit<l>ed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #57:2>
The &pound-sign;30,000 that Orient earned from the matches against Swindon have pro<l>duced a welcome cash injec<l>tion but Clark knows that sooner or later they will re<l>ceive an offer neither he nor the player can refuse .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #58:2>
Heald did not disappoint his audience , but he didn't have a chance with Steve Foley 's 88th minute cross that was headed home by Steve White for the only goal of the game .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #59:2>
Swindon goalkeeper Fra<l>ser Digby also made a stun<l>ning save from Kevin Dick<l>enson but he could only watch in relief as a free kick from Terry Howard hit the post .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #60:2>
&ldquo; We feel a bit hard done by to have lost , &rdquo; said Clark .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #61:2>
&ldquo; But if there is a small con<l>solation it is that we won't fall any further behind in our League programme .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #62:2>
Pro<l>motion was always our pri<l>ority . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #63:2>
The end of the Wembley dream ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #64:2>
&ldquo; Well , we still have the Leyland DAF Cup , haven't we ? &rdquo; smiled Clark .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #65:3>
Gooch 's timely win
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #66:3>
JOHN THICKNESSE from Carrara on a pre-Test boost
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #67:3>
ENGLAND 'S search for their first elusive first-class win on tour ended 40 minutes after lunch here today when Mike Atherton pushed Mike Kasprowicz for an uncontested single .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #68:3>
The tourists beat Queensland by 10 wickets and deserved it : outplaying them since Sunday after no more than an adequate first day when , helped by loose batting , they disposed of the State for 286 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #69:3>
Queensland , whose inconsistency has been the despair of their sup<l>porters since long before they began trying to buy the Sheffield Shield by signing top players from outside - Wes Hall , Jeff Thomson , Majid Khan , Greg Chappell , Viv Richards , Ian Botham and Graeme Hick to name a few - had a collectively poor match , notably in yesterday 's collapse to 42 for five .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #70:3>
But with Robin Smith and John Morris making their first hundreds of the tour , Graham Gooch his high<l>est score , and Allan Lamb proving his fitness in his second match back after injury , England go into Friday 's Test at Adelaide in their best spirits of the series .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #71:3>
Conditions there will be almost as different as can be from Carrara Park where , once the ball had lost its hardness , even Devon Malcolm had to bang it in halfway down the pitch to make it bounce waist-high .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #72:3>
But on a tour like this - 13 defeats in 26 games of one length or another - any win is welcome , though Gooch , as usual , kept his feet firmly on the ground when he talked about it later .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #73:3>
&ldquo; Just because you win one game , it doesn't mean all is right , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #74:3>
&ldquo; We played better against Queens<l>land , and it 's always nice to win .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #75:3>
It will give us confidence for Adelaide .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #76:3>
But our game is still not what I 'd like it to be .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #77:3>
To compete with the best sides , we still have to improve in all respects ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #78:3>
there 's no two ways about it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #79:3>
People have got to double their ef<l>forts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #80:3>
If they don't , well , it 's their ca<l>reers . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #81:3>
Fears that England might still have a lot of work ahead of them to<l>day , despite Queensland restarting 94 for five , eased after 15 minutes when Phil Tufnell at mid-off brought off an exceptional catch to get rid of Stuart Law .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #82:3>
The 22-year-old , who made a hun<l>dred in each innings in the Shield at Perth the other week and looks a cer<l>tain Test cap , drilled a Gladstone Small half-volley a good yard to Tufnell 's right and might well have expected to collect four for it even over this vast and holding outfield .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #83:3>
But Tufnell launched himself side<l>ways and caught it two-handed while airborne .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #84:3>
Having built up a reputa<l>tion as one of the worst fielders Eng<l>land have sent to Australia - actually he 's not , he just doesn't con<l>centrate often enough - it was annoy<l>ing for him that there were only two or three hundred spectators to see it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #85:3>
Three-quarters of an hour later , af<l>ter the seventh wicket had added 29 , Ian Healy untypicaliy chased a wide<l>ish one from Small , and when Craig McDermott followed , Queensland at 143 for eight were still a run off avoiding an innings defeat .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #86:3>
With Small flagging after 110 min<l>utes , they had no trouble over that , but there was no longer any doubt that England 's day had come .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #87:3>
Jack Russell 's fifth catch finished Queensland off in time for Gooch and Atherton to lace an over before lunch , and they reached the target in the 11th over afterwards .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #88:4>
Graf Meets her match
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #89:4>
PETER BLACKMAN from Melbourne
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #90:4>
STEFFI GRAF 'S three-year winning reign at the Australian Open ended when the Czech Jana Novotna beat her 5-7 , 6-4 , 8-6 in a gripping quarter final at Flinders Park .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #91:4>
Novotna , ranked 13th in the world , was not finished there .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #92:4>
Though she believed Graf was still justifiably the world No. 1 , she predicted only hard times ahead for the German superstar .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #93:4>
&ldquo; We are not afraid of Graf anymore , &rdquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #94:4>
&ldquo; We go out to beat her .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #95:4>
We know how to play her and the top players proved that last year when she won only one Grand Slam event .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #96:4>
&ldquo; But I feel great .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #97:4>
I 've beaten Steffi Graf and it feels like the end of the tourna<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #98:4>
What else is there to do ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #99:4>
All the times we have played in the past seemed like a preparation for this day , &rdquo; added Novotna .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #100:4>
&ldquo; I am in my best shape ev<l>er .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #101:4>
These days I am calmer on court and I did not let her dictate the pace of the match .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #102:4>
She likes to control every<l>thing , but I did not allow it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #103:4>
I was very determined about that . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #104:4>
Novotna went on the Cen<l>tre Court knowing she was 9-0 down in career matches with Graf , but she dethroned the defending champion with inspirational tennis over two hours 28 minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #105:4>
&ldquo; I played so well heading towards this match , but lost when it mattered , &rdquo; ad<l>mitted Graf .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #106:4>
&ldquo; I used the wrong tactics .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #107:4>
I rushed the net too much , while she used her head and hardly made a mistake . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #108:4>
Graf 's hold on the No. 1 spot is weakening , though she has lost to only seven players since 1 January , 1987 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #109:4>
They are Monica Seles , Martina Navratilova , Gabri<l>ela Sabatini , Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , Zina Garri<l>son , Pam Shriver and now Novotna .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #110:4>
This time it produced a sensational match which ended with a huge Centre Court crowd giving Graf and Novotna a standing ovation for four minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #111:4>
Novotna soaked it up but Graf seemed to hear none of it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #X112:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #X113:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #X114:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #X115:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #X116:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #117:4>
&ldquo; She will strike back - hard . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #118:4>
Meanwhile Seles trailed 3-0 to the German Anke Hu<l>ber but once she had drawn level , she eased away to win 6-3 , 6-1 to clinch a semi-final against Mary Joe Fernandez .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #119:4>
Fernandez , recently signed up by Boris Becker 's man<l>ager Ion Tiriac and last year 's beaten finalist , ham<l>mered Katerina Maleeva 6-3 , 6-2 in a dreary advert for women 's tennis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #120:4>
Britain 's Jeremy Bates and American Kelly Jones are through to the semi-finals of the men 's doubles .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #121:4>

Ryan in the clear over Buckton injury
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #123:5>

<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #124:5>
WASPS have publicly cleared Dean Ryan , their England No. 8 , of any blame over the incident that left Saracens captain John Buckton needing 15 stitches in a head wound .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #125:5>
The Wasps club have issued a statement aimed at ending the &lsquo; malicious gossip &rsquo; that has surrounded the injury sustained during the Courage Division One game at Southgate on 12 January .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #126:5>
Ryan has been angered by reports that it was his boot that hurt Buckton and said : &rdquo; I was nowhere near that ruck when the incident happened and the Saracens video of the game proves my claim &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #127:5>
John Langley , the Wasps team manager , and other club officials watched the video recording provided by Saracens .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #128:5>
He said : &rdquo; The ruck in which John Buckton was hurt took place with Dean Ryan more than 20 yards away .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #129:5>
&ldquo; The game was refereed by Ed Morrision , a member of the England international panel , and he is clearly seen on the video in a good position .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #130:5>
&ldquo; He would have seen any illegal play and the ball was clearly trapped between Buckton and a Wasps player as both sets of forwards tried to ruck it back .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #131:5>
&ldquo; It was a case of players going in for the ball and there is no reason to take action aginst any Wasps player . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #132:5>
Four other Saracens players needed stitches for cuts picked up during the game although Buckton was by far the most seriously injured .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #133:5>
The cut cost him a place on the England replacements bench against Wales last Saturday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #134:5>
Langley said the Wasps players had been spoken to in gen - eral about behaviour on the field : &ldquo; We made it clear that , as a club , we do not condone foul play . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #135:5>
&ldquo; We deeply regret the in<l>jury to John Buckton and have issued a statement to end the malicious gossip that started after the match . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #136:5>
Saracens insist that relations with their North London rivals are stilI very good following the league game .

&lsquo; Famous Five &rsquo; go off to form their own club
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #138:6>
by Neil Allen
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #139:6>
A GROUP of five British &lsquo; am<l>ateur &rsquo; athletics stars today launched their own exclu<l>sive marketing group , enti<l>tled The Chafford Hundred Club .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #140:6>
Organiser and club presi<l>dent Fatima Whitbread , reigning women 's world champion in the javelin , said the setup was conceived last spring and that she had been seeking sponsors for several months .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #141:6>
The other members of this new second claim club are all European champions - Linford Christie ( 100 me<l>tres ) , John Regis ( 200m ) , Co<l>lin Jackson ( 110 hur<l>dles ) and Steve Backley ( javelin ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #142:6>
The club name comes from a residential and leisure area near Grays with which Whitbread has been associat<l>ed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #143:6>
&ldquo; Originally I was out to get some support for different kinds of javelin events , &rdquo; she explained .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #144:6>
&ldquo; But then l talked with Linford and Colin about their own ideas for obtaining endorsements and we de<l>cided that since I was still off injured I was the one with the time to go into the business community and discuss how we can work with them . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #145:6>
Though details have yet to be finalised Whitbread is close to sealing around &pound-sign;250,000 of endorsements for the elite group .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #146:6>
Eventually it is possible that the five gold medal winners may even compete on rare occasions for the Chafford Hundred , wearing specially endorsed kit .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #147:6>
There are long term plans , too , for the &lsquo; five &rsquo; to be joined by some of Britain 's out-standing junior athletes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-014 #148:6>
The organisatlon of the club has been approved by British athletics financial officials with the understanding that it will not cut across the sport 's own extensive mar<l>keting .

Steel plant union leader vows to fight on
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #2:1>
By Eric McKenzie
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #3:1>
THE leader of the Ravenscraig workforce pledged yesterday to con<l>tinue the fight to ensure a future for the Motherwell steel plant .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #4:1>
Tommy Brennan , the shop stewards ' convener , also accused British Steel of conducting a war of attrition to destroy completely steelmaking at the plant .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #5:1>
Mr Brennan , who was in London on Friday when BS announced that a further 1,100 jobs were to be axed along with one of the plant 's two furnaces , said : &ldquo; I 'm sure many people must be wondering just what the hell is going on within British Steel to do what they are doing to a plant of this nature . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #6:1>
Speaking on the eve of a meeting of the full Ravenscraig works com<l>mittee to discuss this latest blow , he said : &ldquo; What we have obviously got to do now is to devote all our energies in securing an economic one blast furnace operation to take away any possibility of BS saying that it 's uneconomic . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #7:1>
He went on to say that rather than conducting a war of attrition , BS should release Ravenscraig for sale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #8:1>
&ldquo; They should be honest about it and put the plant up for sale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #9:1>
Let 's see if there are buyers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #10:1>
The Scottish Secretary , in evidence to the trade and industry select committee look<l>ing into Ravenscraig , indicated there were buyers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #11:1>
Approaches had been made and people were inter<l>ested . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #12:1>
Mr Brennan claimed that the BS chairman , Sir Robert Scholey , had as an objective the closure of Ravenscraig .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #13:1>
&ldquo; He is two-thirds of the way to achieving that . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #14:1>
Campbell Christie , general secre<l>tary of the STUC , also accused BS of doing everything possible to make sure there was no future for Ravenscraig .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #15:1>
He said the government 's gua<l>rantees at the time of privatisation to safeguard production at Ravenscraig up to 1994 or if the plant became surplus to require<l>ments it would be made available for sale , had proved to be valueless .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #16:1>
Malcolm Bruce , the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats , has tabled a Commons motion deplor<l>ing the loss of 1,100 jobs and the closure of the blast furnace .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #17:1>
He is urging the Scottish Office to inter<l>vene to prevent the dismember<l>ment of the Scottish steel industry and for pressure to be brought to bear on BS to sell its Scottish assets to any potential buyers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #18:1>
Mr Bruce also said at the week<l>end that the trade and industry sec<l>retary , Peter Lilley , should use his powers to try to force BS to put Ravenscraig on the market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #19:1>
Tony Worthington , the Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie , has written to the Scottish industry minister , Allan Stewart , asking him to deny a newspaper report at the weekend that Lanarkshire Develop<l>ment Agency was being forced to carry out its duties on less money , in spite of the problems at Ravenscraig .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #20:1>
The report claimed that the LDA and other local enterprise com<l>panies set up by Scottish Enterprise had been told that only 68 per cent of the total money they had asked for was available .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #21:1>
Brian Wilson , Labour MP for Cunninghame North , is seeking a meeting with Sir Robert Scholey to discuss the future of the 100-strong workforce at the BS Hunterston ore terminal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #22:1>
Friday 's announcement about Ravenscraig had cast an im<l>mediate shadow over the jobs at the terminal , he said .

Council house mortgage plan seen as threat to rural areas
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #24:2>
By David Scott , Local Government Editor
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #25:2>
THE Government 's plans to extend its rent-to-mortgage scheme to council tenants will have an adverse effect on rural areas where housing oppor<l>tunities are already scarce , it is claimed today .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #26:2>
According to Shelter ( Scot<l>land ) , the take-up of the scheme , due to come into effect on 1 April , is likely to be higher in rural areas than elsewhere because wages are traditionally low while un<l>employment is relatively secure .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #27:2>
The rent-to-mortgage scheme is aimed at people whose incomes are too low to purchase under the existing right-to-buy scheme , which offers more generous dis<l>counts .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #28:2>
In a statement assessing the likely impact of the new measures , Shelter estimates that rent-to-mortgage will apply to only about 4 per cent of council tenants .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #29:2>
Those on housing benefit are excluded from the scheme .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #30:2>
The impact on the housing market is likely to be small , Shelter states .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #31:2>
However , it says it is con<l>cerned about the effect in rural Scotland , claiming that these areas have already suffered a disproportionate loss of housing stock through council house sales .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #32:2>
In some areas , it states , as many as one third of homes have already been sold .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #33:2>
Shelter says its own surveys have found that the number of families and single people who are homeless or on coun<l>cil house waiting lists is increasing at a more rapid rate in rural areas than in the rest of Scotland .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #34:2>
A further loss of stock through sales under the rent-to-mortgage scheme would only exacerbate that trend and jeopardise the housing oppor<l>tunities of future generations within rural communities , Shelter states .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #35:2>
More generally , it says it is concerned that encouraging low income tenants into owner occupation at a time of deepening recession is a high risk policy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #36:2>
&ldquo; As unemploy<l>ment rises and the hidden costs of owner-occupation become apparent , tenants who have purchased under the rent-to-mortgage scheme may be at a risk of losing their homes ...
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #37:2>
up to one in ten homeless families are in that position due to mortgage default . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #38:2>
The extension of the rent-to-mortgage scheme to council tenants in Scotland follows a pilot project carried out by Scottish Homes and in new towns .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #39:2>
The Scottish Office housing minister , Lord James Douglas-Hamilton , will face further criticism of the rent-to-mortgage scheme when he addresses an Institute of Housing seminar in Edin<l>burgh today .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #40:2>
Some senior housing officials believe it is a bad policy at a time of rising homelessness and increasing mortgage default cases .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #41:2>
Lord James is expected to announce details of a new publicity drive to coincide with the extension of the rent-to-mortgage scheme to council tenants .

Region acts over racial fostering problem
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #43:3>
By Sarah Wilson
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #44:3>
SOCIAL workers in Lothian are trying to recruit ethnic fos<l>ter parents to avoid the prob<l>lems of placing ethnic children with white families .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #45:3>
In an effort to encourage more carers from minority communities , the social work department and the Lothian Racial Equality Council held a seminar yesterday to explain the adoption and fostering process to volunteers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #46:3>
The department was especi<l>ally keen to encourage Asian , Chinese and Afro-Caribbean families to come forward .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #47:3>
&ldquo; Unfortunately it 's a racist society and children who aren't white will grow up with negative images of black people and these will be re<l>inforced if they are placed with a white family because white culture is the dominant culture , &rdquo; said Gerry O'Hara , the region 's officer for chil<l>dren and families .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #48:3>
These sentiments have been enshrined in law in the Chil<l>dren Act of 1989 , soon to be implemented in England .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #49:3>
Part of this legislation will apply in Scotland requiring councils to take into account the race , culture and religion of the child , when choosing carers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #50:3>
Saroj Lal , of Lothian Racial Equality Council , said : &ldquo; We realised there was a problem two or three years ago when we heard of an Asian child being placed with a white fam<l>ily . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #51:3>
Ms Lal found that Lothian did have a policy of placing children with carers of the same race , but could not im<l>plement it because of the shortage of carers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #52:3>
When she spoke to minority families she found many would like to help , but did not know how to become foster parents .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #53:3>
If the project is successful and a large number of ethnic minority families volunteer to adopt and foster , they may be asked to take in white chil<l>dren .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #54:3>
&ldquo; A white child is not likely to have negative images of white people , &rdquo; said Mr O'Hara , so they would not suffer from living in a family of a different race .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #55:3>
&ldquo; Back in the Sixties , people talked about building a multi<l>racial society and it was al<l>most chic to adopt a black child .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #56:3>
Now we are realising that it might not have been in the best interest of the child .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #57:3>
The alternatives at that time were bleaker for black chil<l>dren in care .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #58:3>
It is now time to change our practice . &rdquo;

Rat clearance plan to lure puffins back to island
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #60:4>
By Linda Kennedy
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #61:4>
AN attempt to entice puffins back to Ailsa Craig is to be made next month , by poison<l>ing the rat population which has destroyed the puffin col<l>ony over the past century .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #62:4>
Up to 250,000 pairs of puffins have been lost from the granite island off south<l->west Scotland , their chicks and eggs eaten by thousands of brown rats .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #63:4>
But in mid<l->March , poison is to be placed on the island to rid the island of rats and encourage the puffins to return .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #64:4>
The plan comes from the Ailsa Craig Working Group , comprising ornithologists from Glasgow University , and repesentatives of the Nature Conservancy Council and Rentokil .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #65:4>
As the island is a designated site of special scientific interest , the NCC had to be consulted before a plan could go ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #66:4>
Lord Ailsa , who owns the island , gave his approval and money for the project has come from the NCC and priv<l>ate donations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #67:4>
One of the people behind the rat-eradication plan is Bernard Zonfrillo , an ornithologist conducting research on Ailsa Craig 's seabirds who is the secretary of the working group .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #68:4>
He emphasised that puffins are not rare seabirds :
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #69:4>
&ldquo; There are some on St Kilda and about 15,000 pairs on the Isle of May .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #70:4>
There is also a small colony on Sanda Island , off the Mull of Kintyre .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #71:4>
But we want to restore Ailsa Craig to its former glory with puffins .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #72:4>
It was the fault of man that rats got on to the island . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #73:4>
Ailsa Craig lies ten miles west of Girvan .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #74:4>
It is 1,114 feet high , two and a quarter miles round the base , with cliffs reaching over 700 feet in height .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #75:4>
Public access is restric<l>ted and even the lighthouse is now unmanned -
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #76:4>
it was automated in 1990 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #77:4>
The brown rat first appeared there in 1889 , after ships ferried materials and supplies to the newly built lighthouse .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #78:4>
A 19th-century orni<l>thologist , Robert Gray , when visiting the island in the 1860s , described an occasion on Ailsa Craig when he dis<l>turbed the puffin population .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #79:4>
He wrote : &ldquo; The entire mass of birds at once got on wing and flew seawards , returning in a few minutes and surrounding me completely .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #X80:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #X81:4>

<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #82:4>
By the 1920s , puffin num<l>bers were diminishing and the Royal Society for the Protec<l>tion of Birds undertook a rat control programme on Ailsa Craig .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #83:4>
Rats were poisoned , but their number rose again soon after .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #84:4>
Nowadays puffins are not seen ashore .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #85:4>
&ldquo; Other birds are still there - gannets , guillemots , &rdquo; said Mr Zon<l>frillo .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #86:4>
&ldquo; But it 's the burrow<l->nesting birds that have been lost .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #87:4>
Puffins nest in burrows three or four feet deep in the soil on the slopes of the rock .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #88:4>
Storm petrels have also been affected .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #89:4>
The rats can get in . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #90:4>
Dr Patricia Monaghan , a senior lecturer at Glasgow University who is a scientific adviser to the working group , feels it is a tragedy that the is<l>land 's puffins were wiped out by an accidental introduction of rats :
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #91:4>
&ldquo; These birds are usu<l>ally found on islands because there are no predators . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #92:4>
Warfarin , grain im<l>pregnanted with poison , will be put in bait boxes which rats , and not birds , can enter .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #93:4>
&ldquo; The most important thing is that we target only the rats , &rdquo; said Mr Zonfrillo .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #94:4>
&ldquo; This was the most rat-specific poison . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #95:4>
There are plans for the poi<l>son to be airlifted on to the island by helicopter , but if that fails , several boats will ferry the Warfarin across .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #96:4>
Mr Zonfrillo expects to have to scale the cliffs to place poison on some shelves .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #97:4>
After March there will be a monitoring period .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #98:4>
&ldquo; All it needs is one pregnant female rat left alive for the plan to have failed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #99:4>
We will be leaving out chewsticks coated in margarine in parts of the island to find out if we have to target any more poison . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #100:4>
If needed , decoy puffins may be used to encourage the real birds back .
<ICE-GB:W2C-015 #101:4>
The painted dummies are fixed on sticks .

L&ampersand;M turns &pound-sign;34m of debt into equity
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #2:1>
by Vanessa Houlder , Property Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #3:1>
LONDON &ampersand; Metropolitan , the troubled property developer , is today expected to unveil a restructuring agreement involv<l>ing the first substantial conver<l>sion of debt to equity seen in the current property downturn .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #4:1>
The announcement will coincide with its interim results and changes to the board .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #5:1>
L&ampersand;M has been in talks with its bankers since October , when the collapse of the consortium that planned to buy County Hall , the headquarters of the Greater Lon<l>don Council in , left L&ampersand;M , one of the members , bearing the loss of its &pound-sign;2.5m deposit and a &pound-sign;5.3m write-off from other costs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #6:1>
These losses came as the final blow to a portfolio that was already under intense strain from the falling property market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #7:1>
Fol<l>lowing a revaluation by Richard Ellis , a firm of surveyors , the company is expected to make more than &pound-sign;80m of provisions , equivalent to the shareholders ' funds in its last balance sheet .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #8:1>
The restructuring deal , which has been arranged by Kleinwort Benson , L&ampersand;M 's merchant bank , involves the conversion of &pound-sign;34m of short-term debt into five-year money and the roll over of inter<l>est .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #9:1>
In addition , the banks will provide up to &pound-sign;1.8m of new work<l>ing capital , which will allow the company to complete its develop<l>ments .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #10:1>
The banks include the Bank of Scotland , Lloyds , Secu<l>rity Pacific and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #11:1>
The shareholders , which include BICC , Scottish Amicable , Argosy , Norwich Union and the Bank of England 's pension fund , will be heavily diluted .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #12:1>
The banks will be issued with war<l>rants , which will allow them to dilute the interests of existing shareholders by up to 15 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #13:1>
In the event of a takeover , the warrants with convertible redeemable preference shares will give the banks rights over the enlarged share capital up to a maximum of 49.9 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #14:1>
The agreement , requires L&ampersand;M to sell &pound-sign;25m of property .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #15:1>
The company 's developments include a golf complex at Aix-en-Prov<l>ence in France , a 200,000 sq ft industrial park at Bicester and a 100,000 square foot industrial park at Heathrow .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #16:1>
The restructuring should lead to the relisting of the shares , fol<l>lowing an extraordinary general meeting on March 21 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #17:1>
The restructuring agreement of L&ampersand;M may add to a perception that , in many cases , the banks are taking a patient approach with troubled property compa<l>nies .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #18:1>
This stems from a desire not to be forced into making fire sales of property when the mar<l>ket is depressed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #19:1>
L&ampersand;M , which floated in 1986 , was originally a joint venture between Balfour Beatty and Lon<l>don &ampersand; Edinburgh Trust , a prop<l>erty company then run by the Beckwith brothers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #20:2>
Banks hope to net a saving
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #21:2>
David Lascelles reports on a cost-cut
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #22:2>
A new word is creeping into the world of banking : net<l>ting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #23:2>
It could make bank<l>ing cheaper and safer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #24:2>
Every day , banks generate bil<l>lions of dollars ' worth of pay<l>ments to each other , mainly through their dealings on the for<l>eign exchange market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #25:2>
Netting is a way to reduce the volume of money they actually pay by mak<l>ing it possible for them to trans<l>fer a net rather than gross amount .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #26:2>
Thus , if Bank A ends the day owing Bank B $100m and Bank B owing Bank A $75m , they will settle up with Bank A paying Bank B $25m .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #27:2>
Apart from being simpler , this approach offers banks big savings in two ways .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #28:2>
First , there is a significant decrease in administration costs because fewer payments have to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #29:2>
Second , there is a reduced risk because the gross exposure of the banks to each other has been cut .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #30:2>
This raises the prospect of a sav<l>ing in capital resources at a time when banks around the world are under pressure to strengthen their capital ratios .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #31:2>
Netting between pairs of banks has been in existence for some time , and is largely a matter of agreement between the two .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #32:2>
The recent debate , however , has been about the planned development of multilateral netting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #33:2>
This enables many banks , possibly several dozen , to net out their payments to each other through a central clearing house .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #34:2>
One of the most ambitious schemes is the Exchange Clear<l>ing House Organisation ( Echo<l>net ) planned for next year in Lon<l>don , the world 's largest foreign exchange centre , where an esti<l>mated $187bn ( &pound-sign;96bn ) changes hands every day .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #35:2>
Mr Graham Duncan of Bar<l>clays Bank , who is the project 's manager , believes multilateral netting can reduce banks ' foreign exchange exposure by up to 90 or 95 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #36:2>
At the moment , Echonet has 22 members led by a steering com<l>mittee consisting of Barclays , Midland , Dresdner , ABN-Amro , G&eacute;n&eacute;ra Bank , BNP , J.P. Morgan and BCI .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #37:2>
It will be based around a central computer which will receive information about the deals done by its members .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #38:2>
Each day it will net out their payments and work out how much they owe each other .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #39:2>
It will also han<l>dle the payments .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #40:2>
A similar scheme to Echonet is being planned for the US and Canada - North America Clear<l>ing House ( Nacho ) .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #41:2>
Ultimately , Echonet and Nacho could link to form the basis for a global net<l>ting system .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #42:2>
It sounds simple , but netting has profound implications both legally and for the way money markets operate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #43:2>
These have stirred banking authorities to take a close interest .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #44:2>
Last year , Mr Alexandre Lam<l>falussy , the general manager of the Basle-based Bank for Interna<l>tional Settlements , produced a report which now forms the basis for all netting schemes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #45:2>
It laid out standards to ensure that net<l>ting schemes are sound , legally and financially .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #46:2>
Any that are not will be officially declared &ldquo; unsafe &rdquo; by national banking authorities , and banks will be warned off .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #47:2>
The major legal issue is &ldquo; nova<l>tion &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #48:2>
This is the process by which a bank 's gross obligations are transformed into a new contract for its net obligations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #49:2>
Mem<l>bers of a scheme agree to &ldquo; novate &rdquo; their contracts &semi; pre<l>cisely
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #50:2>
how they do it depends on the law of the country where they operate .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #51:2>
Novation has to be cast-iron from a legal point of view .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #52:2>
Should a member bank go into liquidation , a receiver could demand all gross payments due to the bank from other members of the scheme rather than just the net payments .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #53:2>
Novation pre<l>vents this .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #54:2>
Another point raised by the Lamfalussy report was how to guarantee the liquidity of netting schemes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #55:2>
In the Echonet plan , the clearing house will act as princi<l>pal for the payments , and will therefore be liable for the obliga<l>tions of any member who defaults .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #56:2>
To meet this danger , Echonet 's members will probably endow it with a pool of assets - some $250m to $500m - and agree to commit lines of credit .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #57:2>
This would enable the scheme to keep going in a crisis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #58:2>
But ulti<l>mately all members would have to share in a loss .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #59:2>
A third point is competition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #60:2>
A successful netting scheme would be bound to attract the largest banks in the market and might become a closed shop .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #61:2>
Banking supervisors insist netting schemes have clear , fair member<l>ship criteria to ensure that any suitable bank can join .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #62:2>
Existing netting schemes - of which there are several - are based on bilateral deals .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #63:2>
One of the largest is Fxnet , the London and New York-based scheme for foreign exchange netting , which is seven years old and has 28 members , with more waiting to join .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #64:2>
Fxnet is based on computers at each member bank linked into a network .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #65:2>
The computers log deals and calculate net payments .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #66:2>
Mr Peter Bartko , the chairman , says his biggest members are net<l>ting about 200 to 300 deals a day , which is equivalent to 10 to 15 per cent of their total deals .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #67:2>
The cost of netting is $2.60 a deal .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #68:2>
He hopes to extend it shortly to include banks in Tokyo .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #69:2>
A proprietary scheme was also launched two years ago by Chase Manhattan Bank - Chasenet<l>ting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #70:2>
This is a book-keeping oper<l>ation -
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #71:2>
Chase keeps track of its members ' deals and informs them how they net out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #72:2>
Chase also handles the actual payments if member banks want , but this is not automatically part of the ser<l>vice .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #73:2>
The service operates out of London and New York .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #74:2>
Mr Art Northrop , the scheme 's sales executive , says it has nine active participants , including banks like Deutsche Bank 's Lon<l>don branch , Midland , ABN-Amro and Westdeutsche Landesbank .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #75:2>
Volumes are still quite small with banks netting about 20 deals a day , and deal values ranging from $250,000 up to $150m .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #76:2>
In bilateral deals , the manager of the scheme acts only as an information processor , so neither Fxnet nor Chasenetting takes any risk if a participant defaults .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #77:2>
The big question hanging over netting is whether banking supervisors will recognise nova<l>tion and permit banks to calcu<l>late their capital adequacy according to their net rather than their gross exposures .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #78:2>
If they do , it would lead to big cost savings because banks would need much less capital for their foreign exchange operations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #79:2>
At the moment , a bank might need up to $10m in capital to support a $1bn foreign exchange book .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #80:2>
The matter is currently being debated by the Basle Committee of international bank supervi<l>sors .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #81:2>
Mr Peter Hayward , the com<l>mittee 's secretary , says : &ldquo; We are conscious of the need to reach a solution quickly but the subject is a complex one and will take a little time to understand and resolve . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #82:2>
The committee would have to be convinced that banks ' exposures really were reduced through netting .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #83:2>
Mr Duncan says that Echonet 's success would not depend on a favourable ruling from the Basle Committee because many banks would be satisfied with the bene<l>fits of reduced administration and risk .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #84:2>
&ldquo; But each bank will have its own motivation , &rdquo; he says .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #85:3>
Reduced importance of the brewer 's pub tie
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #86:3>
Philip Rawstorne on the industry implications of the GrandMet / Courage pubs-for-breweries swap
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #87:3>
THE SEALING of the long-delayed GrandMet / Courage pubs-for-brew<l>eries swap will quicken the pace of structural change in the UK brewing industry .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #88:3>
GrandMet , until now Britain 's fifth largest brewer , follows Boddington and Green<l>all Whitley out of the industry to become the country 's largest pub retailer , initially responsi<l>ble for more than 8,450 pubs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #89:3>
By the end of the decade , such retailing strength may have its own impact on the brewing trade .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #90:3>
But it is Courage - owned by Fosters Brewing of Austra<l>lia - which is now the key to the further reshaping of the industry .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #91:3>
Courage emerges from the deal as Britain 's sec<l>ond largest brewer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #92:3>
With a 20 per cent share of the market , it is poised to challenge Bass , the industry leader .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #93:3>
The waves stirred by this move will be felt throughout the industry .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #94:3>
Among the first to be affected will be a number of overseas lager brewers operat<l>ing in the UK market .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #95:3>
The merging of the Courage and Grand/Met Lager portfolios cre<l>ates several conflicts of inter<l>est .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #96:3>
Denmark 's Carlsberg , whose licensing agreement with GrandMet expires this year , now sits uncomfortably along<l>side Foster 's .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #97:3>
Anheuser-Busch ( Budweiser ) and Miller ( Miller Lite ) , the rival US brewers , find themselves in a similar position &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #98:3>
so do Germany 's Hol<l>sten , and Kronenbourg , from France 's BSN group .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #99:3>
Both Carlsberg and Anheu<l>ser are expected to move quickly to find more compati<l>ble partners .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #100:3>
Carlsberg , which earns half its profits in the UK , has been speculatively linked with Scottish &ampersand; Newcastle which needs a leading lager brand if it is to fulfil its expan<l>sionist ambitions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #101:3>
Guinness , with its distribution strengths , is also considered a likely part<l>ner for a leading lager brewer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #102:3>
Further uncertainty is injected into the situation by Molson , Foster 's partner in Canada , which is now seeking to grow its UK business &semi; and by Asahi , the Japanese brewer and Foster 's shareholder , which may have similar aims .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #103:3>
The shake-out of lager brands , together with the planned sale of the Ushers brewery and the impact of the guest beer orders which allow pub tenants to take one beer from another supplier , could reduce Courage 's volumes by 800,000 barrels a year and its market share to less than 19 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #104:3>
But Courage faces greater threats - and opportunities .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #105:3>
Over the next two years the operation of the government 's guest beer orders ( allowing national brewers ' tenants to stock a beer from an outside supplier ) and the release of 11,000 pubs from all tied beer supplies will greatly extend the free-trade sector .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #106:3>
The importance of the brewer 's tie will also be reduced by the continuing shift in beer sales from pubs to off-licences and supermarkets .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #107:3>
Last year , according to Mr John Spicer , analyst at Kleinwort Benson , the national brewers ' tied sales represented 42 per cent of their total beer turnover and more than 66 per cent of their profits .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #108:3>
By 1998 , he estimates , the tied trade will have fallen to 19 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #109:3>
However , tied estates will then still provide a guaranteed income stream for each of the major brewers - except Courage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #110:3>
Its exclusive rights to supply GrandMet and the jointly owned Inntrepreneur Estate will be eroded gradually but completely .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #111:3>
More than 1,100 pubs are to be sold within the next two years .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #112:3>
By the end of next year , a further 2,100 Inntrepreneur pubs will be freed from the tie .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #113:3>
In 1995 , the supply contract with GrandMet 's 1,540 managed pubs runs out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #114:3>
In 1998 , the remaining Inntrepreneur pubs will be released .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #115:3>
Courage believes this competitive disadvantage will be outweighed by the advantages it can extract from its enlarged brewing operations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #116:3>
Against the background of a probable marginal decline in total UK beer consumption , shares in the freer market towards the end of the decade will depend upon production and distribution efficiencies , sales effort , brand and marketing strengths and pricing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #117:3>
Courage will have strong brands - Foster 's and at least a couple of leading premium lagers &semi; Courage Best bitter and ales such as Webster 's and John Smith 's .
<ICE-GB:W2C-016 #118:3>
Within the next two years , it should also achieve substantial economies of scale in production .

Youngsters find it tough to buy home
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #2:1>
By RICHARD PAYTON
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #3:1>
THE MAJORITY of young people in Wales can no longer afford to buy their own homes because of a widening gap between incomes and house prices .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #4:1>
By last year only half of those in a position to look for housing for the first time could afford average terraced house prices of nearly &pound-sign;36,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #5:1>
The situation is worse in rural areas of Wales as incomes are of<l>ten much lower and housing sometimes a lot higher than ur<l>ban areas because of the desir<l>ability of living in a rural location , the Association of Welsh Districts said yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #6:1>
This comes despite the Government 's stated aim since 1979 to achieve growing and not declining rates of home ownership .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #7:1>
Now , because of the decline in council housing and little new house building , the rented sector can no longer cope with demand .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #8:1>
The association warns that this leads to young people mov<l>ing out of rural areas in huge numbers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #9:1>
The Association of Welsh Districts Dis<l>tricts says the answer to the problem is to increase the amount of affordable rented housing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #10:1>
Until 1980 there was a tremen<l>dous increase in the amount of council housing , but since then the policy of selling council ho<l>mes to the tenants has led to as sharp a decline .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #11:1>
The association points out that the decline in council hous<l>ing has not been matched by any significant increase in the amount of association construction .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #12:1>
The Government has a target of 3,000 new housing association homes a year , but the Association Associ<l>ation of Welsh Districts estima<l>tes estimates a more adequate figure would be around 6,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #13:1>
Councils should have a part to play in this by using greater dis<l>cretion in allowing all council tenants the right to buy their own properties , the association has said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #14:1>
Initiatives
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #15:1>
It has tackled the Govern<l>ment on its claim that housing associations should be the chief form of social housing in Wales .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #16:1>
The association says that there is evidence that there is a high level of satisfaction from tenants living in council homes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #17:1>
Shared ownership schemes where a council retains a pro<l>portion of the ownership on a property is another option which should be considered .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #18:1>
The association is urging local authorities to look for initiatives which can tackle the problem , especially in rural areas .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #19:1>
A spokesman said , &ldquo; This is recognised to be a very serious problem . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #20:2>
Car hit couple on country road
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #21:2>
A BRIDGEND couple died from multiple injuries when they were knocked down by a car on a quiet country road last November .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #22:2>
Tests later showed that the vehicle , a Ford Escort Mexico , being driven by a 20-year-old newly-qualified motorist , was in a dangerous condition , an inquest at Bridgend heard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #23:2>
Mrs Margaret Mary Skidmore , aged 65 , and 61-year-old Mr Gareth Thomas , both of New<l>bridge Gardens , were crossing the road to feed horses kept in fields bordering the Ewenny to St Brides Major road on Novem<l>ber 21 , when they were struck .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #24:2>
The coroner for Mid Glamorgan south , Mr Alan Da<l>vies , recorded verdicts of acci<l>dental deaths and described the accident as &ldquo; tragic &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #25:2>
But he stressed that he could not com<l>ment on blameworthiness at any inquest .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #26:2>
The accident happened after dark and 20-year-old Michael Forty , of Tythegston near Porth<l>cawl , later told he the police , &ldquo; I just saw them in the corner of my eye and they came out and I hit them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #27:2>
They just walked into the road .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #28:2>
I braked after I hit them . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #29:2>
Opposite
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #30:2>
Consultant pathologist at Bridgend 's Princess of Wales hospital , Dr Alan Rees , said the cause of death in both cases was multiple injuries consistent with them being struck from the left .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #31:2>
Mr George Edward Wilkie of Poole Cottage , St Bridges Major , was travelling in a lorry in the opposite direction .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #32:2>
He said , &ldquo; I more or less heard the accident rather than saw it .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #33:2>
I heard the sound of a body hitting the car -
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #34:2>
it 's a very soft impact sound . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #35:2>
He added that the car stopped almost immediately and the young man , who was in &ldquo; a ter<l>rible state , &rdquo; told him he had hit two people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #36:2>
Pc Michael Packwood inter<l>viewed Mr Forty after the acci<l>dent .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #37:2>
Mr Forty told him that he had passed his driving test in June 1990 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #38:2>
He had been travel<l>ling at about 45mph .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #39:2>
But a skid mark at the scene indicated a speed of not less than 59mph at the time of the acci<l>dent , the inquest heard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #40:2>
Mr Forty denied this and also said he had been dazzled by the lorry 's lights as it came down the hill towards him .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #41:2>
Defects were later found in the Ford Escort car by accident investigation officer Pc Alan Griffiths .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #42:2>
Mr Forty was reported for careless driving , driving wi<l>thout reasonable consideration , and using a vehicle on the road in a dangerous condition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #43:2>
But Pc Griffiths said , &ldquo; The fact that they were wearing dark clothing made it unlikely that he saw them before the accident . &rdquo;

Joint bid may force out HTV
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #45:3>
By CLlVE BETTS , Welsh Affairs Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #46:3>
TWO TELEVISION companies said to be in<l>terested in bidding for the Wales and West Country franchise are believed to have com<l>bined to launch a joint bid .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #47:3>
Trilion and Flextech have also been joined by a major North American investor to create a combination which could be strong enough to wrest the franchise from HTV .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #48:3>
Bids in the auction for the Channel Three franchises have to be submitted to the Independent Television Commission by May 15 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #49:3>
The applications will then be published to enable public con<l>sultation , with winners ann<l>ounced in October and any newcomers taking over from January 1993 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #50:3>
Trilion is taking the lead in the moves to oust HTV .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #51:3>
The com<l>pany already owns two Cardiff independents , and it is under<l>stood that in the past few days it has been actively signing pro<l>duction deals with other independent production compa<l>nies in both Wales and the West of England .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #52:3>
A spokesman for Trilion said yesterday that neither of the company 's two directors who could comment on the issue were available , but the company 's annual report said last month that the firm was &ldquo; currently examining the feasibility of an involvement in a Channel Three franchise application &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #53:3>
Trilion said it was confident that it was well placed in any such battle .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #54:3>
Last year , Trilion made a &pound-sign;380,000 loss loss on a turnover of al<l>most &pound-sign;16m due , said the report , to new competition in their field from existing ITV contractors .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #55:3>
Children 's TV
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #56:3>
Flextech is a company of al<l>most equal size &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #57:3>
it is working hard to diversify into entertain<l>ments from its base supplying North Sea oil pipes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #58:3>
It already holds almost 50 per cent interests in five cable com<l>panies , and is deeply involved in the Children 's Channel on satel<l>lite TV and with HIT ( Henson ) Communications .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #59:3>
The company , however , would not confirm a bid for the HTV franchise .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #60:3>
Mr Charles Koppel , a cor<l>porate finance spokesman , said last night , &ldquo; We have not made any decision as to whether we mount a bid , or where .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #61:3>
&ldquo; There is so much rumour and gossip in this industry .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #62:3>

Traffic plan for town opposed
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #73:4>
A PLAN to pedestrianise part of Caernarfon has brought protests from some local resi<l>dents .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #74:4>
Gwynedd County Council claim that pedestrianisation would reduce the conflict be<l>tween pedestrians and vehicles in the town .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #75:4>
They are planning an experi<l>mental pedestrianisation scheme , from 11am to 4.30pm , this April and May .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #76:4>
Palace Street , Hole in the Wall , Eastgate Street and Northgate Street will be closed to traffic along their entire length .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #77:4>
High Street will be closed from its junction with Hole in the Wall to its junction with Market Street .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #78:4>
In addition , part of the road between the Castle and Slate Quay will be closed and this will mean Castle Hill will have to be two-way , with a mini-roundabout at the junction with Castle Ditch .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #79:4>
Objection
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #80:4>
Castle Ditch will also have to be two-way near the police station .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #81:4>
Arfon Borough Council has put in a strong objection to the rear<l>rangement of traffic flow around the castle , but they will agree to the trial pedestrianisation of the other streets , apart from the Turf Square area .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #82:4>
Caernarfon Harbour Trust is unhappy about the proposed movement of traffic around the castle , and in particular the blocking of the road near Aber Bridge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #83:4>
The Trust is also concerned about the effect of the proposed two-way system on the area ad<l>jacent to the Harbour Office and Castle Hill .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #84:4>
Dr John Griffith , who lives in Castle Square , says that until a roundabout is built at Seiont Bridge , having two-way traffic on Castle Hill will cause traffic con<l>gestion in Castle Square .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #85:4>
He also fears that pedestrians will be in constant danger on the designated pedestrian way on and is well used by pedestrians . the castle side of the hill be<l>cause this route is not paved. the castle side of the hill be<l>cause this route is not paved and is well used by pedestrians .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #86:4>
Caernarfon Royal Town Council is in favour of the pedes<l>trianisation scheme .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #87:4>
But they recommend that any work by the water , electricity and gas authorities should be done before the scheme is started .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #88:4>
They want the experimental scheme extended to the summer period of July and August to give a better assessment of the result .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #89:4>
The town council is calling for the present one-way system ar<l>ound the castle to be retained in the interest of pedestrian safety .

Top scientist will launch county 's space age project
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #92:5>
ONE OF Britain 's top scien<l>tists is returning to his old school in Wales next week to launch a touring space spec<l>tacular .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #93:5>
Dr John Meurig Thomas , Ful<l>lerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Great Britain and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory , will launch Dyfed education authority 's Spacewatch Initia<l>tive at Gwendraeth Valley Comprehensive School on Wednesday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #94:5>
The pioneering initiative is based around a US-made Starlab planetarium which will tour the county 's 30 secondary schools for two years to support science teaching .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #95:5>
The only touring planetarium in Wales can accommodate 30 pupils at a time inside a silver<l->coloured plastic dome where im<l>ages of the night sky are projec<l>ted on the ceiling .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #96:5>
Pupils from the secondary schools and primary schools in the area will be able to use it during the day and parents will be invited to take their turn in the evenings .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #97:5>
The Starlab is backed by another 20 computer-based science activities , including a working model of the solar sys<l>tem , a large refracting telescope , video programmes and a number of &ldquo; hands-on &rdquo; activities designed to suit children of all ages .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #98:5>
The education department 's science team has even coined a new Welsh word - Ogofod - for the planetarium .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #99:5>
The Spacewatch Initiative is the brainchild of Dr David Nor<l>bury , Dyfed 's senior science advisor .
<ICE-GB:W2C-017 #100:5>
It has been designed and con<l>structed in the education depart<l>ment 's new resource centre at St Clears .

Major faced with double dilemma after poll disaster
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #3:1>
By STEPHEN McGREGOR , Parliamentary Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #4:1>
THE Prime Minister was last night facing two crucial decisions as the shock result of the Ribble Valley by-election brought to an end his honeymoon period as Mrs Thatcher 's successor after only 100 days in office .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #5:1>
Amid persistent reports that the Cabinet is split on alternative means of funding local government to replace the poll tax , the pressure is mounting on Mr Major to bang heads together and come up with a final solution within the next few weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #6:1>
Once that is achieved , he still faces the choice of whether to call a General Election in June or hang on until October or even the spring of next year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #7:1>
The Ribble Valley result , in which the Liberal Democrats snatched the 10th safest Tory seat in the country with a 25% swing , has stunned Tory MPs .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #8:1>
They were braced for a reduced majority , but thought Mr Major 's apparent popularity , coupled with the allied success in the Gulf war , would secure victory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #9:1>
Instead , the Liberal Democrat candidate , Mr Michael Carr , won with a majority of 4601 , overturning a Tory majority of almost 20,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #10:1>
The poll tax emerged as the crucial issue , and there was grave concern amongst Tory back benchers , especially those with marginal seats , that unless the tax was abolished the Conservatives faced disaster at the next election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #11:1>
Mr Major himself , who was on a visit to Scotland , sought to play down the importance of the Ribble Valley result , and insisted it would make no difference either to the review of the poll tax or the date of the election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #12:1>
He said in Edinburgh that he had not yet determined what the date of the election might be , and said he would not be bounced or pushed into a hasty decision on the community charge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #13:1>
He admitted the loss of the seat was disappointing , but said that on the basis of a BBC exit poll the Tories would have won the seat very comfortably if it had been a General Election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #14:1>
&ldquo; It was one of those protest by-elections we have seen so many of in recent years &rdquo; , he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #X15:1>

<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #16:1>
&ldquo; On this occasion the Liberal Democrats were the suitable dustbin for the protest vote , and they won . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #17:1>
Mr Major conceded the Ribble Valley contest had been dominated by the poll tax issue and that it clearly was unpopular there , but he added : &ldquo; You will have to wait until the end of the review .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #18:1>
I am clear in my own mind which way it will go , but you will have to be patient . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #19:1>
Whitehall sources insisted that no greater sense of urgency had been added to the poll tax review as a result of the Ribble Valley result .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #20:1>
The Cabinet committee reviewing the tax is due to meet on Tuesday or Wednesday , and while it is widely expected that an announcement of the Government 's plans will be made before the Easter recess on March 28 , an element of uncertainty remains .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #21:1>
Whatever happens , some sort of announcement will have to be made before the local council elections in May , the outcome of which will have a crucial bearing on Mr Major 's calculations about whether to go to the country the following month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #22:1>
Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine , charged with overseeing the nuts and bolts of the poll tax review , reflected the official line yesterday , insisting that the review would not be speeded up .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #23:1>
He said in Bristol : &ldquo; It has been urgent ever since we did it , but if you set up a review you do not immediately announce its conclusions despite everyone asking you to do so . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #24:1>
As far as the Opposition parties were concerned , the poll tax was rendered stone dead by the Ribble Valley result , and Mr Major 's standing had been dealt a severe blow .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #25:1>
Labour 's deputy leader , Mr Roy Hattersley , commenting in the absence of party leader Neil Kinnock , who was in New York , said : &ldquo; This result was a disaster for the Tory Government in general and John Major in particular . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #26:1>
Labour 's campaign co-ordinator , Mr Jack Cunningham , said : &ldquo; The Ribble Valley by-election result shows clearly that the Government is at the end of the road and that the poll tax has to go , &rdquo; while Shadow Environment Secretary Bryan Gould said : &ldquo; The British people are fed up with Tory excuses and with the continuing Cabinet disarray about the future of this hated tax . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #27:1>
For the triumphant Liberal Democrats , party leader Paddy Ashdown said : &ldquo; On behalf of the people of Britain , the voters of Ribble Valley said that the poll tax must go - and they said they wanted a better alternative to an ineffective Labour Party .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #28:1>
Once again it is the Liberal Democrats who have emerged from this period of political uncertainty with increased standing and improved prospects .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #29:1>
In Ribble Valley it is the Liberal Democrats who have dealt the killer blow to the poll tax . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #30:1>
SNP leader Alex Salmond also reacted to the result , saying : &ldquo; This will be the final death-knell for the poll tax .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #31:1>
The Scottish people have spearheaded the resistance to this unjust and hated tax .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #32:1>
Now that the revolt has spread to their own English heartlands the Tories have no choice but to ditch it . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #33:2>
No Tory seat is safe , says Hattersley
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #34:2>
Scottish Political Correspondent WILLIAM CLARK and GEORGE MacDONALD report from the Labour Party in Scotland 's conference in Aberdeen
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #35:2>
LABOUR deputy leader Roy Hattersley had no words of comfort for the mauled Conservatives yes<l>terday telling them a Gen<l>eral Election would only mean &ldquo; an early Labour government &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #36:2>
He won a standing ovation ova<l>tion after telling confer<l>ence that only one result was possible - a Labour victory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #37:2>
The Tories ' Ribble Valley Val<l>ley by-election disaster also prompted Shadow Chancellor John Smith to throw down the gauntlet
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #38:2>
&ldquo; We want a General Elec<l>tion to come as soon as possible , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #39:2>
&ldquo; Let Mr Major name the day .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #40:2>
&ldquo; Labour is ready for the challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #41:2>
Above all we want to waste no time be<l>fore we can get down to the task of creating a strong economy . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #42:2>
The confident assertions that Labour would finally be on the way to Govern<l>ment heightened the elec<l>tion fever sweeping the conference .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #43:2>
However , senior man<l>agers were more sombre after Labour 's third place showing in the by-election , arguing in private that it would be wrong to read too much into the result .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #44:2>
A senior MP said : &rdquo; Roy said what the delegates wanted to hear .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #45:2>
But if Heseltine comes up with a poll tax solution then it will mean nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #46:2>
We had better keep our feet on the ground . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #47:2>
Mr Hattersley said earli<l>er : &rdquo; Ribble Valley shows there is not a seat in the country safe for the To<l>ries .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #48:2>
I look forward to the earliest possible election with the near certainty that a Labour government follows . &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #49:2>
There was no such qual<l>ification in his speech claiming that a ground<l->swell of revulsion and resentment against the Government would sweep Labour to power .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #50:2>
The Conservatives were cynical enough to go for April , but he added : &rdquo; The question is whether they are stupid enough to at<l>tempt a second deceit of the British people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #51:2>
&ldquo; We understand the se<l>ductive appeal to a dis<l>credited Government .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #52:2>
May and June will allow the Tories to lie about im<l>provements they expect in the autumn . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #53:2>
They would massage the statistics and use fraudu<l>lent forecasts to pretend good times were round the corner .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #54:2>
&ldquo; Let us all pray they try to do it , &rdquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #55:2>

<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #57:2>
Amending a Labour deputy leader 's statement made after the Liberals ' Orpington success 30 years ago : &ldquo; Brothers and sisters we are on our way .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #58:2>
But the route doesn't run through Ribble Valley . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #59:2>
He warned that the elec<l>tive dictatorship had not been retired with Mrs Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #60:2>
Mr Major would not re<l->establish union rights , re-create autonomous local government , or replace the repressive Official Secrets Act .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #61:2>
Mr Hattersley added : &ldquo; The angry scowl may have been replaced by the silly grin , but we have the same old autocratic , intol<l>erant Tory Government . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #62:2>
The Tories tried to pre<l>tend he had only arrived the day Mrs Thatcher re<l>signed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #63:2>
He had been Chief Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer for four years .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #64:2>
He had refused to increase child benefits or pay larger old age pen<l>sions and told unemployed &ldquo; if it isn't hurting it 's not working &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #65:2>
The slump , high interest rates and mortgages were his creation and as a Thatcherite he did not care about the consequences on working people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #66:2>
He had only just discov<l>ered Scotland but needed to be &ldquo; chivvied and chased into remembering that the idea of North Britain died with Queen Victoria &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #67:2>
He repeated Labour 's promise of a Scottish par<l>liament within a year of taking office .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #68:2>
Scotland would lead the United Kingdom and he claimed the threatened closure at Rosyth and British Steel 's Ravenscraig decisions would have been severely challenged by a Scottish parliament .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #69:2>
Scottish Conservatives were fighting a rearguard action to save the poll tax while the English were cry<l>ing for its abolition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #70:2>
Mr Major was trying to slide away from his re<l>sponsibility and Mr Hat<l>tersley said : &ldquo; I offer him this piece of simple advice -
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #71:2>
there is no way it can be redeemed or reformed :
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #72:2>
the poll tax has to be abol<l>ished .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #73:2>
Don't mend it ,
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #74:2>
end it . &rdquo;

More interest kindled in plan to assist tenants buying home
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #76:3>
By FRANCES HORSBURGH , Local Government Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #77:3>
MORE than 7000 council tenants have inquired about the extended Rents to Mortgages scheme since the Government launched an ad<l>vertising campaign last week .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #78:3>
The scheme allows public sec<l>tor tenants to convert their rent payments into a mortgage , allow<l>ing them to buy their homes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #79:3>
Scottish Environment Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton , who has become identified with RTM , said tenants from the Cen<l>tral belt , the Highland and Islands , and Dumfries and Gallo<l>way had registered their interest .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #80:3>
He dismissed claims that the scheme could result in more peo<l>ple defaulting on mortgage payments and having their homes repossessed .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #81:3>
Its design and level of financial commitment should ensure that did not happen , he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #82:3>
People would get full counsel<l>ling before starting the process of buying so that they were aware of the commitments of home owner<l>ship .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #83:3>
But at the institute of Housing 's Scottish conference in Aviemore yesterday Mr John Maxton , Labour 's local govern<l>ment spokesman , made it clear his party still felt the plan was a dangerous diversion from the housing problems in Scotland .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #84:3>
He claimed the effort expended in processing the scheme was large in relation to the returns , and he believed it was a potential trap for tenants on low incomes .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #85:3>
Labour was proposing shared tenancy , which would allow ten<l>ants to own a stake in their homes but would give them the ability to increase or decrease that share according to their circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #86:3>
But Lord James said in Edin<l>burgh that RTM was one of the most important initiatives the Government had undertaken in this Parliament .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #87:3>
It was a fundamental part of the policy to increase freedom of choice in housing matters , and as part of that policy to widen op<l>portunities and encourage div<l>ersification of tenure wherever possible .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #88:3>
The twin attainment of more than 200,000 public sector sales and the breaking of the 50% barrier in owner occupation were remarkable milestones .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #89:3>
Mr Maxton , however , accused the Tory Party of being obsessed with the aim of increasing home ownership both as a so-called ide<l>al and also because they believed , wrongly , that home owners would not vote Labour .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #90:3>
He said the Labour Party was not opposed to the extension of home ownership to council ten<l>ants or other of social landlords .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #91:3>
In fact it intended to extend ownership to long-term tenants in the private sector .
<ICE-GB:W2C-018 #92:3>
But the Tory approach had led to a housing crisis and a solution which , even after 10 years of sell<l>ing , ignored the housing needs of more than 81% of council house tenants .

Street fights injure eight in Belgrade
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #3:1>
EIGHT more people were injured in fresh clashes between police and anti-communist demonstrators in the Yugoslav capital , Belgrade , yes<l>terday but two huge rallies later passed off peacefully .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #4:1>
Police fired tear gas and lashed out with batons yesterday morning at several thousand protesters chanting &ldquo; red killers &rdquo; and &ldquo; fascists &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #5:1>
The communist rulers of the republic of Serbia , which has Belgrade as its capital , called an emergency session of parlia<l>ment yesterday after being rocked by three days of protests in which two people were killed and more than 80 injured .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #6:1>
Later peaceful rallies were staged by 30,000 anti-communists and 30,000 sup<l>porters of Serbia 's communist rulers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #7:1>
As the opposing groups gathered , army tanks were withdrawn from key positions in the city centre but police were out in force and patrolled in armoured vehicles .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #8:1>
The city centre was sealed off .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #9:1>
The Serbian president , Mr Slobodan Milosevic , who is facing Yugoslavia 's biggest anti-communist protests since the Second World War , met student leaders and promised parliament would consider their demands .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #10:1>
Students occupying a central square chanted &ldquo; Slobo is Saddam &rdquo; and were led by a rock band in singing &ldquo; Give peace a chance &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #11:1>
They demanded the release of an estimated 170 people jailed in the past three days , and an end to the censorship clamped on Belgrade 's independent radio and TV .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #12:1>
Intellectuals joined the students in the manner of Eastern Europe 's anti-com<l>mmunist revolts in late 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #13:1>
Actors vowed to keep all Belgrade theatres closed yesterday and refused to appear on TV .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #14:1>
A mile away about 30,000 pro-commun<l>ists , many of them bussed in from factories , held a rally in a park .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #15:1>
They waved Serbian flags and held up pictures of Mr Milosevic before dispersing quietly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #16:1>
The news agency , Tanjug , said a parliamentary committee had approved a draft law strengthening the powers of the republic 's president to declare a state of emergency .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #17:1>
The riots followed months of rising tension and nationalism across Yugo<l>slavia , where four of the six republics rejected communist rule in elections last year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #18:1>
Serbia is one of those still controlled by the communists , who now call themselves socialists .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #19:1>
Mr Milosevic told the emergency session of Serbian parliament that the republic could face anarchy and chaos .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #20:1>
&ldquo; The enemies of Serbia want to bring a puppet regime into power , a regime that would take orders from elsewhere , &rdquo; he said .

Yeltsin under fresh attack by hardliners
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #24:2>
THE call by Mr Boris Yeltsin for a political war against the Soviet president , Mr Mikhail Gorbachev , brought a fresh fierce attack from communist hardliners yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #25:2>
The Communist Party newspaper Pravda suggested he was a phoney democrat and some members of parlia<l>ment demanded a criminal investigation over his speech .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #26:2>
But there were signs that the shrill attacks against Mr Yeltsin , leader of the Russian Federation , would only further weaken his opponents .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #27:2>
An economist , Mr Nikolai Engver , told the Supreme Soviet during a debate on the speech Mr Yeltsin made on Saturday : &ldquo; Every one of our actions against Yeltsin increases his popular rating . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #28:2>
A Young Communist League deputy , Mr Sergei Tsyplyaev , said : &ldquo; Any resolu<l>tion aimed against Yeltsin will cause another storm of meetings , protests and , God forbid , strikes . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #29:2>
The government faced strikes in the vital Soviet coalfields yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #30:2>
Miners in the Soviet Union 's two main coal regions voted yesterday on whether to hold an all-out strike which would hit the economy hard .

Some Soviet miners have already been on striking strike for 11 days .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #32:2>
The result of the vote will be known today but one strike committee representative in the Kuzbass coalfield said : &ldquo; It looks as though we will vote for general strike . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #33:2>
The caution by members of parliament and the overwhelming defeat of a proposed condemnation of Mr Yeltsin testified to his the enormous support he enjoys from ordinary people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #34:2>
Yesterday he cemented that relation<l>ship with the striking miners , who promised their full support and readiness to defend him &ldquo; with all available non-vio<l>lent methods . &rdquo;

Crackdown in troubled townships
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #38:3>
THE South African law and order minister , Mr Adriaan Vlok , yesterday imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on strife-torn black townships of Johannesburg .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #39:3>
His decision followed 45 deaths and at least 60 injuries in the country 's worst weekend of factional violence this year .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #40:3>
Mr Vlok said : &ldquo; This is an attempt to prevent further bloodshed . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #41:3>
Hundreds of police officers and soldiers patrolled the townships with the joint blessing of the rival African National congress and Inkatha Freedom Party .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #42:3>
Mr Vlok declared the worst-hit northern town<l>ship , Alexandra , the east<l>ern of Tembisa , and four districts of Soweto in the south offi<l>cial &ldquo; unrest areas &rdquo; which imposed the curfew and gave police and soldiers wide powers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #43:3>
Fierce battles between supporters of the Zulu<l->based Inkatha and the multi-tribal ANC killed 35 people and injured 53 in Alexandra and left a fur<l>ther four dead in Soweto 's Meadowlands district , police said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #44:3>
They also reported four people killed in Tembisa and at least seven injured .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #45:3>
A spokesman , Col Frans Malherbe , said two people were shot dead while attacking patrols in Alex<l>andra township .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #46:3>
The last major incident of factional violence this year was on February 4 , when a clash between Inkatha and the ANC at Meadowlands killed 24 people .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #47:3>
Alexandra was extremely tense yesterday and sealed off by hundreds of police officers and soldiers , said Col Malherbe .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #48:3>
Both the ANC and Inkatha said in separate statements that they wel<l>comed the presence of the security forces and said their supporters were not acting on the instructions of the leadership .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #49:3>
On January 29 the ANC 's deputy president , Mr Nelson Mandela , and the Inkatha president , Chief Mangosuthu Buthe<l>lezi , issued a joint call on their followers to end the factional violence but the appeal had no effect .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #50:3>
Traffic officers said many of Alexandra 's streets were empty yester<l>day and that most of the residents had stayed indoors to avoid possibly running a gauntlet of hos<l>tile factions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #51:3>
Officials from the ANC and Inkatha said a peace agreement reached in Alexandra late on Sunday appeared to have averted renewed serious violence but it was still not know known if the situation would continue .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #52:3>
The combatants used spears , clubs , and hatchets .

Mandela witness &lsquo; in dream world &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #54:4>
THE lawyer defending Mrs Winnie Mandela on kidnap and assault charges yes<l>terday accused a key pro<l>secution witness of living in a dream world and lying to incriminate her .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #55:4>
The witness , Mr Ken<l>neth Kgase , admitted on his third day of giving evidence that he had misled the court with some of his testimony but stood by the details of his alleged kidnap and assault by Mrs Mandela and her three co-accused .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #56:4>
Mrs Mandela 's defence counsel , Mr George Bizos , produced an article writ<l>ten by Mr Kgase for the Sunday Telegraph , pub<l>lished in London , which contained a description of his alleged abduction differing from his account to Johannesburg 's Rand Supreme Court .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #57:4>
&ldquo; Do you admit that you have been living in a dream world ? &rdquo; Mr Bizos asked Mr Kgase .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #58:4>
The wit<l>ness replied : &ldquo; Not altogether . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #59:4>
Mr Kgase said he could not explain how he had omitted important points from his testimony which were contained in the newspaper article .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #60:4>
He denied that the article had been ghost<l->written , although he agreed with Mr Bizos ' sub<l>mission that he was scarcely capable of writing intelligible English .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #61:4>
Mrs Mandela and her associates are accused of masterminding the kidnap of Mr Kgase and three others from a Methodist church hostel in Soweto township , Johannesburg , two years ago and of holding them prisoner at her house where they were kicked , beaten and whipped .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #62:4>
One of the activists allegedly taken from the hostel with Mr Kgase , 14-year-old Stompie Seipei , was later found dead in a ditch .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #63:4>
Mrs Mandela 's senior bodyguard , Jerry Richardson , was sen<l>tenced to death last year for the murder .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #64:4>
Mrs Mandela , whose husband Mr Nelson Man<l>dela is deputy president of the African National Congress , and her co-ac<l>cused deny the charges .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #65:4>
They have said Mr Kgase and his associates left the hostel of their own accord to escape the homosexual advances of a church minister .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #66:4>
Mrs Mandela sat impass<l>ively while Mr Kgase gave evidence in the court , which was half-empty for the first time since the case opened last month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #67:4>
There were very few ANC supporters on the steps of the courthouse when Mrs Mandela arrived for yesterday 's hearing .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #68:4>
Mr Kgase 's cross-exami<l>nation is expected to last another day .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #69:4>
Another of the four allegedly kid<l>napped from the hostel , Mr Barend Mono , is then likely to take the witness stand .

Boatpeople talks planned
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #71:5>
From JONATHAN BRAUDE in Hong Kong
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #72:5>
ANOTHER round of international talks on Vietnamese refugees will start in Geneva later this month to discuss fear of a surge of boatpeople heading for destinations as far apart as Hong Kong and Australia .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #73:5>
A Foreign Office spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed that Britain , Australia and Canada had issued an invitation to informal talks to co-ordinate international thinking before the start of the new sailing season in April and May and to pave the way for a formal conference of Asian and Western nations .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #74:5>
Hong Kong has been pressing for a conference in the hope of reopening the debate over mandatory repatria<l>tion to Vietnam of boatpeople not classed as political refugees .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #75:5>
Other countries in Asia have followed Hong Kong 's lead in screen<l>ing those people seeking asylum to separate genuine refugees from economic migrants not eligible for sanctuary and resettlement in the West .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #76:5>
Reports at the weekend claimed the Prime Minister , Mr John Major , would raise the issue with the United States president , Mr George Bush , at their summit meeting in Bermuda on Saturday , in the hope of softening US opposition to forced repatriation .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #77:5>
Hong Kong has not forcibly deported any Vietnamese since the international outcry over an oper<l>ation of December , 1989 when 51 protesting boatpeople were put on a plane to the Vietnamese capital , Hanoi , under armed police guard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #78:5>
Vietnam said it would not accept back anyone returned by force .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #79:5>
However , Hong Kong has come under renewed pressure in recent months as the numbers volunteer<l>ing to return to Vietnam have dropped dramatically .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #80:5>
Meanwhile , more than 400 Viet<l>namese a month have arrived overland through China since December , reversing the trend of previous winters when unfavour<l>able winds closed the sea-routes and reduced new arrivals to a trickle .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #81:5>
Australia has been shocked by the arrival of well-equipped Vietnamese boats on its northern shores last month .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #82:5>
It fears any move by Indonesia to turn away boatpeople already refused entry by Singapore and Malaysia could force the Vietnam<l>ese to sail on for Australia .

Wife 's nose for trouble
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #84:6>
A MAN who killed his girlfriend more than 20 years ago has finally confessed after his wife complained of a foul smell coming from a cupboard in their home , Japanese police said yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #85:6>
The 43-year-old man , whose name was withheld , will not face trial .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #86:6>
The 15-year statue of limitations for the crime expired in 1985 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #87:6>
Police who went to the couple 's home in Nagoya , central Japan , found a female torso in a metal box in the cupboard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #88:6>
The man said the remains were those of a woman he had lived with .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #89:6>
She was a bar hostess and he strangled her one night when she came home late .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #90:6>
He said he sawed off the legs and disposed of them .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #91:6>
Police said two severed limbs were found separately alongside rivers in 1970 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #92:6>
Forensic tests matched them with the torso .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #93:6>
The man , said to be a driver , confessed to the crime and said he had moved house and often changed jobs for fear of being found out .
<ICE-GB:W2C-019 #94:6>
After he married , he told his wife not to open the metal box because it belonged to a friend .

Council tax will still punish the big spenders
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #2:1>
By JOHN DEANS Political Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #3:1>
PROPERTY owners in high<l->spending Labour areas will still be stung under the new council tax , it emerged yes<l>terday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #4:1>
The system will retain a key ele<l>ment of &lsquo; accountability &rsquo; to make people sensitive to the efficiency of their local authority .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #5:1>
Expenditure above the official tar<l>get figure set in Whitehall will be spread proportionately among the seven bands of property owners pay<l>ing the charge .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #6:1>
Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine unveils his long-awaited discussion paper on the poll tax re<l>placement tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #7:1>
Although he intends to retain cap<l>ping powers to force down excessive budgets , it appears that a degree of overspending will be allowed through to make householders pay the price for profligate councils .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #8:1>
&lsquo; It will en<l>courage councils to get their budgets into line and the voters to throw out those councillors who fail to do that , &rsquo; said a Whitehall official .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #9:1>
Accountability of local authorities was a key element of the original poll tax concept and is seen as cru<l>cial by senior Ministers .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #10:1>
However , Mr Heseltine intends to play tough with Left-wing authori<l>ties who repeatedly flout Govern<l>ment guidelines and commit them<l>selves to budgets way out of line with the national average .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #11:1>
&lsquo; This has gone on for too long , and the Government intends to wage war on the high spenders , &rsquo; one sen<l>ior Tory said yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #12:1>
There is mounting optimism among Tories that the Heseltine package will defuse the row over lo<l>cal government finance and boost their election chances .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #13:1>
&lsquo; It 's a very clever solution to the problems posed by the community charge , &rsquo; said a senior party source .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #14:1>
&lsquo; It will be seen as fair , it will be easy to collect .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #15:1>
We are confident it will be welcomed across the country . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #16:1>
The tax , intended to replace the community charge in 1993 , will be levied in seven bands of property value , producing average bills ranging from &pound-sign;260 for a small flat to &pound-sign;750 for a large de<l>tached house .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #17:1>
It will assume a household of two adults .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #18:1>
Single occupants will be entitled to a 25 per cent discount , but there will be no extra charge on homes with more than two adults .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #19:1>
Nurses and students will pay nothing and there will be help for the low-paid , single parents and the elderly .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #20:1>
Property values will be set by Inland Revenue experts and the seven bands fixed centrally under legislation which Mr He<l>seltine plans to lay before Par<l>liament in the autumn .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #21:1>
It is still to be explained how the system will take account of widely-varying values in differ<l>ent parts of the country .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #22:1>
Repealed
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #23:1>
But bills will continue to vary according to the council 's ability to control spending .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #24:1>
They could be as low as &pound-sign;100 on a small property in a low<l->spending area , or over &pound-sign;1000 on a country mansion in a high-spending one .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #25:1>
Some will pay more than un<l>der the community charge but they will be mainly Tory sup<l>porters living in larger proper<l>ties .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #26:1>
And with much lower bills because of the Budget decision to centralise a large chunk of town hall expenditure , Mr He<l>seltine is confident he can avoid a backlash .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #27:1>
He is also expected to recom<l>mend abolishing many existing county or district authorities in favour of a one-tier system of local government .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #28:1>
Labour Opposition leader Roy Hattersley denounced the charges and said they would be repealed in the event of a Labour election victory .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #29:1>
But Spelthorne Tory MP David Wilshire protested : &lsquo; It is mind-blowing for Labour to say they would abolish some<l>thing before they have seen it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #30:1>
His backbench colleague Rob<l>ert Adley said : &lsquo; He has thrown away what little chance they may have had of winning by rejecting this before it is an<l>nounced . &rsquo;

Charles looks to happy days at Happylands
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #32:2>
By PAUL HARRIS
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #33:2>
HAPPYLANDS ...
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #34:2>
even the name of the farm is perfect for an environment-friendly Prince with a passion for organic produce .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #35:2>
There are wild flowers in the fields and views across some of the the most beautiful countryside in Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #36:2>
It 's also a valuable stretch of agricul<l>tural land right on the edge of Prince Charles 's estate at Highgrove , Gloucestershire .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #37:2>
And it 's one which rather embar<l>rassingly provides a fine view of his house .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #38:2>
Yesterday after the 80-acre farm became &lsquo; unexpectedly available &rsquo; , moves were being made to ensure he gets the chance to buy it without fear of outside competition .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #39:2>
It is being put up for sale without going on the market and without being advertised .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #40:2>
Those involved in the deal are keeping details secret to avoid putting the sale in jeop<l>ardy .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #41:2>
But one local farm manager estimated it would be worth more than &pound-sign;500,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #42:2>
A member of the vendors ' camp said : &lsquo; It has not yet been sold but don't be sur<l>prised if Charles is the new owner .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #43:2>
He 's a farmer and this farmland borders his bounda<l>ries .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #44:2>
What would you do if your next-door neighbour 's land came up for sale ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #45:2>
Happylands is being offered for sale by the family of two sisters who lived there - one died in 1988 and the second died about six months ago .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #46:2>
Highgrove House and the more humble Happylands farmhouse are only five fields apart .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #47:2>
Footpaths used by Di<l>ana , William , eight , and Har<l>ry , six , are nearby and the acquisition of Happylands would add to the family 's se<l>curity .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #48:2>
It also divides two sec<l>tions of land the Prince farms for the Duchy of Corn<l>wall .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #49:2>
Highgrove Estate comprises 347 acres and its farmland adds about another 900 acres .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #50:2>
Charles has decided all his growing there will be organic .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #51:2>
Grain from Home Farm on the estate was used to pro<l>duce an organic wholemeal loaf for supermarkets and he was recently reported to have bought Close Farm , which borders his land to the east .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #52:2>
Buying Happylands would further his dream .

&lsquo; Graffiti art &rsquo; student joined gang of spray can raiders
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #54:3>
Daily Mail Reporter
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #55:3>
A YOUTH studying graffiti on a college arts course became involved with a gang who caused &pound-sign;14,000 damage spray-painting tube trains .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #56:3>
Paul Mulvey , 19 , acted as a lookout the night carriages were attacked and was caught with three paint cans .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #57:3>
Art student Mulvey and his tutor at Kingsway College in central London decided he would make the graffiti study as a project for his diploma , a court heard .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #58:3>
But he &lsquo; got a bit too involved and felt compelled to take part &rsquo; √≠ , his defence lawyer said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #59:3>
Last night the head of the British Transport police squad set up to deal with the craze said a number of college art courses included graffiti .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #60:3>
&lsquo; Some people say it 's a new art form , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #61:3>
&lsquo; I would say it isn't .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #62:3>
Some of it is rubbish . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #63:3>
It costs London Underground &pound-sign;2 million a year to clean up the damage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #64:3>
Four youngsters have died in the past five years , electrocuted by live lines as they painted trains .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #65:3>
Mulvey of Basing Street , North Kensington , was ordered to do 80 hours hours ' community service after admitting one charge of criminal damage at Isleworth Crown Court .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #66:3>
A judge told him and three other youths : &lsquo; If you had been older you would have gone straight to prison . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #67:3>
Julian Mussi , 17 , of Chartwell Place , Epsom , Surrey , Alfie Rowe , 15 , of Chelsham Road , Clapham , South London , and Jonathan Rampling , 16 , of Victoria Grove , Stoke Newington , North London , admitted various charges of criminal damage .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #68:3>
Rampling and Mussi were each ordered to do 100 hours hours ' community service .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #69:3>
Rowe was fined &pound-sign;225 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #70:3>
Prosecutor Howard Vagg said there was a &lsquo; whole spray paint culture &rsquo; with gangs using trains as &lsquo; canvasses &rsquo; &lsquo; canvases &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #71:3>
He said : &lsquo; These young people look at it as a way of making their mark .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #72:3>
&lsquo; The trains have to be cleaned at a cost of thousands of pounds and are out of service while being cleaned , causing inconvenience to the public . &rsquo;

Jogger mystery after &lsquo; perfect son &rsquo; murder
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #74:4>
By PETER ROSE Crime Correspondent
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #75:4>
POLICE hunting the killer of a bank manager 's &lsquo; perfect &rsquo; son were last night looking for a mystery jogger .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #76:4>
Sports fanatic David Nock , 16 , collapsed dying into a policeman 's arms after a fren<l>zied knife attack .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #77:4>
The jogger was seen following him as he left a rugby club party .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #78:4>
Last night , David 's devastated family were trying to come to terms with the apparently motiveless murder .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #79:4>
&lsquo; He was a perfect son and we loved him very , very much and can't believe someone could do this , &rsquo; said his father Peter , a Midland bank manager in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #80:4>
&lsquo; It just hasn't sunk in that David won't be coming home . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #81:4>
David , an apprentice mechanic , was a natural athlete , played for Chelten<l>ham Rugby Club 's under-16 team and was also a keen cricketer .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #82:4>
He 'd been at a fund-raising disco on Friday night and was jogging back to his home in the suburbs at Collum End Rise , Leckhampton , when he was attacked .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #83:4>
He staggered 150 yards into a police sergeant 's arms saying : &lsquo; I 've been stabbed . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #84:4>
Police said the jogger could be just a friend - or the killer himself .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #85:4>
He was between 20 and 25 , under six foot , of medium build with dark hair .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #86:4>
He was wearing jeans and a tracksuit top .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #87:4>
&lsquo; We desperately need to find out who this man is and establish the exact route David took . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #88:4>
Mr Nock and his wife Kath have two other children , David 's twin sister Sally , who is still at school , and elder brother , Robert , a student in London .

Laureate too ill for royal poem
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #90:5>
POET Laureate Ted Hughes , 60 , is recovering from a bout of shingles , a painful viral inflammation of the nervous system .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #91:5>
His eyesight was temporarily affect<l>ed , making it very difficult to write and preventing him working on a cel<l>ebration of the Queen 's 65th birthday .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #92:5>
Literary figures defended him yester<l>day .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #93:5>
Former chairman of the Poetry Society , Alan Brownjohn , said : &lsquo; I had heard that Ted was under the weath<l>er .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #94:5>
He has written in the past for these occasions .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #95:5>
If he has not this time I would think that 's probably the reason . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #96:5>
Poet Gavin Ewart said : &lsquo; In the old days the Poet Laureate did write for royal weddings and birthdays and they were usually set to music .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #97:5>
But there 's no actual requirement to do it under the terms of the office . &rsquo;

Major bait for Owen
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #99:6>
A BIG NEW JOB - BUT NO PLACE IN THE CABINET ?
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #100:6>
DR DAVID Owen will not get a job in any fu<l>ture Tory Cabinet , sen<l>ior party members in<l>sisted last night .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #101:6>
But they said the ex-SDP leader could be rewarded with an important public post if he supported the Conservatives in the next election .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #102:6>
Yesterday , other Tories warned Mr Major to steer clear of the former La<l>bour Foreign Secretary .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #103:6>
One called him a &lsquo; political fire ship &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #104:6>
But a Whitehall insider said the Prime Minister might find a &lsquo; suitable slot &rsquo; for Devonport .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #105:6>
He dismissed speculation that the ex-SDP leader had been offered a Cabinet job in secret talks with Mr Major .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #106:6>
&lsquo; There have been no one-to-one meet<l>ings , and there is no truth that Dr Owen has asked for a Cabinet post or been offered one , &rsquo; he added .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #107:6>
However , the two like each other and agree on several key policy issues , and Dr Owen has recently lavished praise on Mr Major 's handling of the Gulf War and the Kurdish crisis .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #108:6>
A poll in yesterday 's Observer showed the two main parties on 40 per cent with the Liberal Democrats on 14 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #109:6>
An Owen declaration for the Tories might swing vital votes , but some senior members were urging Mr Major to be cautious .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #110:6>
MP Nick Budgen said Dr Owen was regarded as a difficult man .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #111:6>
He added : &lsquo; Much more important are our tradi<l>tional friends the Ulster Unionists . &rsquo;

Travel in London dearest in Europe
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #115:7>
TRAVELLERS pay more for public transport in London than in any other European city , a survey says today .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #116:7>
The system is the most ex<l>pensive of the ten biggest EC cities yet is frequently attacked for being too old , dirty and overcrowded .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #117:7>
An average London journey of six miles costs &pound-sign;1.40 .
<ICE-GB:W2C-020 #118:7>
Com<l>muters in Athens pay just 30p for a similar trip by tube , bus or train .

Your sight test
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #2:1>
Your sight can be tested only by a registered ophthalmic optician ( optometrist ) or an ophthalmic medical practitioner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #3:1>
Your optician
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #4:1>
If you want to find an optician : &bullet; go to your local main post office or library and ask to see the list of registered opticians in your area or &bullet; ask at your local Citizens Advice Bureau or &bullet; look in the phone book yellow pages under &lsquo; Opticians &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #5:1>
You can also get a list from your Family Practitioner Committee ( Health Board in Scotland ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #6:1>
Their address is in the phone book .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #7:1>
Sight tests
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #8:1>
As from 1 April 1989 free ( NHS ) sight tests are only available to certain groups of people .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #9:1>
You will get an NHS sight test if you : &bullet; are under 16 &bullet; are 16 or over but under 19 and still in full-time education
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #10:1>
You will get an NHS sight test if you : &bullet; or your partner get &bullet; Income Support &bullet; Family Credit
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #11:1>
You will get an NHS sight test if you : &bullet; have a valid Department of Social Security exemption certificate AG 2 &bullet; need complex lenses and would get an NHS voucher for them - see below &bullet; are registered blind or partially sighted &bullet; are a diagnosed diabetic or glaucoma patient &bullet; are age 40 or over and the parent , brother , sister or child of a person with diagnosed glaucoma &bullet; are a patient of the Hospital Eye Service .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #12:1>
Other people will have to pay for their sight test , the cost of which may vary from one optician to another , so it may pay you to shop around .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #13:1>
How to get your NHS sight test
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #14:1>
Look for an optician who displays a sign that he or she does NHS sight tests and ask them for a form to complete to get your sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #15:1>
You won't be asked for proof before having the test unless you are claiming because you have a certificate AG 2 or need complex lenses ( see below ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #16:1>
The Family Practitioner Committee ( FPC ) to whom your form will be sent may however check your claim at a later date .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #17:1>
( They check a percentage of the forms they receive . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #18:1>
Diagnosed diabetic and glaucoma patients
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #19:1>
For the FPC to make a check in your case it will be necessary for them to write to your doctor to ask him or her if you have diabetes or glaucoma .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #20:1>
You will have to put the name and address of your doctor on the form and agree to a check being made .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #21:1>
If you do not agree the optician could refuse to test your sight .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #22:1>
The registered blind and partially sighted
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #23:1>
You will be asked to put on the form the name and address of the local authority with whom you are registered .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #24:1>
If you do not give this information the optician can refuse to test your sight .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #25:1>
Complex lenses
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #26:1>
If you have to wear complex lenses then you must show the person who tests your sight a copy of your last glasses prescription .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #27:1>
You would have been given it at your last sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #28:1>
If you have not got it the optician may be able to check your prescription from his or her records or by examining your present glasses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #29:1>
Certificate AG 2
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #30:1>
You can apply for help with NHS costs under the low income scheme - see page 17 of this leaflet .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #31:1>
If the Department of Social Security has sent you a certificate AG 2 you should show this to the optician at the time of your sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #32:1>
You can apply for help immediately after your private sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #33:1>
( If you then get certificate AG 2 which is valid within 14 days of your sight test you should go back to your optician and get the sight test application form , complete the front of it and send it with the receipt for your sight test to your local Family Practitioner Committee .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #34:1>
The Family Practitioner Committee will then give you back the money you paid for a private sight test up to a maximum of &pound-sign;11.20 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #35:1>
This must be done within three months of your sight test . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #36:1>
Your prescription
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #37:1>
If your sight test shows that you need glasses the optician must give you a prescription .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #38:1>
If you 've already been wearing glasses , you must still be given a prescription , even if your sight hasn't changed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #39:1>
You will be asked to sign an acknowledgement that you have been given your prescription .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #40:1>
You cannot be asked to pay for your sight test until your prescription has been given to you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #41:1>
The optician cannot say that he or she will only test your sight if you buy glasses from him or her .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #42:1>
If you don't need glasses the optician will give you a statement saying this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #43:1>
The statement/prescription form will also say if he or she is referring you to your doctor because he or she thinks you need more help .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #44:1>
Your prescription is yours by right and is valid for two years .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #45:1>
If you don't use the prescription straight away , you should keep it where you can find it again .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #46:1>
NHS vouchers for help with optical costs
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #47:1>
You can apply for help with optical costs if you are on low income .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #48:1>
You may get help with the cost of a sight test and may get a voucher towards glasses or contact lenses
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #49:1>
It will depend on the result of your claim .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #50:1>
The Department of Social Security will send you an AG3 showing how much you can afford to pay .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #51:1>
If your glasses or contact lenses cost more than any voucher you are given then you will have to pay the difference yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #52:1>
You will automatically get a free sight test if you are in one of the groups shown on page 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #53:1>
You will also get a voucher to help you pay for your glasses or contact lenses if you are in one of the groups shown below .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #54:1>
Group 1 -
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #55:1>
People who have automatic entitlement
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #56:1>
When you go for your sight test , tell the optician you think you can have a voucher .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #57:1>
Then tick the voucher entitlement box when you sign the sight test form .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #58:1>
If you need new glasses the optician will give you a prescription and a voucher which you can use to help pay for them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #59:1>
You automatically get an NHS spectacle voucher if : &bullet; you 're under 16 or &bullet; you 're 16 or over but under 19 and still in full-time education or &bullet; you get either &bullet; Income Support or &bullet; Family Credit or are the partner of someone who gets Income Support or Family Credit .

<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #63:1>
AG 3
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #64:1>
Amount you can afford to pay less than &pound-sign;11.20
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #65:1>
If you get a certificate AG 3 which shows you can contribute less than &pound-sign;11.20 , you should ask the optician for form ST ( V ) on which you can apply for help with the cost of a private sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #66:1>
If the amount of the private sight test is more than the cost of the NHS sight test then you will have to pay the balance yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #67:1>
Anything left from your contribution will be taken off the amount of any spectacle voucher you may get .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #68:1>
Examples
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #69:1>
AG 3 shows your voucher(s) for optical costs reduced by &pound-sign;9 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #70:1>
The NHS sight test is &pound-sign;11.20 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #71:1>
Private sight test costs &pound-sign;7 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #72:1>
You pay all that amount because you can afford to pay &pound-sign;9 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #73:1>
There is &pound-sign;2 left which will be deducted from your spectacle voucher .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #74:1>
Your voucher(s) are reduced by &pound-sign;3 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #75:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #76:1>
You pay &pound-sign;3 towards your sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #77:1>
You then get the full value of any spectacle voucher .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #78:1>
Your voucher(s) are reduced by &pound-sign;7 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #79:1>
The NHS sight test is &pound-sign;11.20 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #80:1>
Your private sight test is &pound-sign;15 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #81:1>
You will pay &pound-sign;7 towards your sight test from the AG 3 amount plus the amount it exceeds the NHS sight test ( &pound-sign;15-&pound-sign;11.20 ) : in total &pound-sign;10.80 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #82:1>
You will then get the full value of your spectacle voucher because all your contribution has been used up on the sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #83:1>
You can afford to pay more than &pound-sign;11.20
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #84:1>
If your contribution is &pound-sign;11.20 or more you do not need to fill in ST ( V ) -
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #85:1>
the adjustment is made on the spectacle voucher .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #86:1>
You will need to show your sight test receipt and your AG 3 to the person from whom you buy your glasses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #87:1>
Your AG 3 shows &pound-sign;15 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #88:1>
You pay &pound-sign;12 for your private sight test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #89:1>
This leaves &pound-sign;3 to come off your spectacle voucher .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #90:1>
Refund of fee for a private sight test
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #91:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #97:1>
Group 3 -
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #98:1>
People who need complex lenses
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #99:1>
If you 're prescribed complex/powerfuI glasses with at least one lens which : &bullet; has a power in any one meridian of plus or minus 10 or more dioptres or &bullet; is made in lenticular form , your optician will tell you and mark your prescription accordingly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #100:1>
In either of these cases you 'll be entitled to a free NHS sight test and also the optician will give you a spectacle voucher which you can use to help pay for your glasses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #101:1>
Unless you qualify for a voucher by being in Groups 1 or 2 above , you 'll get the smaller voucher value shown in brackets against voucher types C or F at the back of this leaflet , plus any clinically necessary prisms or tints .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #102:1>
IF YOU 'RE NOT IN ONE OF THE THREE GROUPS SHOWN ABOVE , YOU CAN'T HAVE AN NHS VOUCHER .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #103:1>
THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY THE FULL COST OF YOUR GLASSES YOURSELF .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #104:1>
Paying for your glasses
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #105:1>
If you need new glasses because your sight has changed or because your glasses are worn out and you 're in one of the three groups of people shown on pages 7-9 , the optician will give you an NHS spectacle voucher to help pay for them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #106:1>
You can use it to buy either glasses or contact lenses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #107:1>
The optician will mark your voucher with a letter-code .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #108:1>
This code depends on the type of lenses you need and also decides the maximum amount of help the voucher can give you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #109:1>
If you 've been given a voucher because you have a low income , the value of your voucher may be reduced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #110:1>
There are special contact lens vouchers available through the Hospital Eye Service if these are prescribed for you as clinically necessary ( see page 14 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #111:1>
You can use ordinary vouchers towards the cost of contact lenses instead of glasses if you prefer , but you will have to pay any additional costs yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #112:1>
Your optician will be able to tell you about this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #113:1>
If you don't qualify for a voucher , you 'll have to pay the full cost of the glasses yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #114:1>
Vouchers
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #115:1>
If you 've ticked the voucher entitlement box on the sight test form the optician will mark your voucher with a letter-code in the Voucher Type box .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #116:1>
The optician decides your letter-code by the type of lenses you need , and this also decides the maximum amount of help the voucher will give you to help pay for your glasses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #117:1>
In some cases additional amounts are available for particular needs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #118:1>
The optician will include these when appropriate .
<ICE-GB:W2D-001 #119:1>
The maximum value of each voucher type is given at the back of this leaflet .

If you have recently left full-time education
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #11:1>
If you have recently left school , college or an approved training course you may be credited with contributions in one of the relevant tax years to help you to get benefit .

Married women
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #16:1>
Married women used to be able to choose to pay contributions at a reduced rate , called reduced liability .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #17:1>
This choice is no longer available , but some women who made the choice before 12 May 1977 still have reduced liability .

You can claim your full entitlement to Unemployment Benefit , but your Widow 's Pension would then be re<l>duced by the amount of Unemployment Benefit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #27:1>
Both benefits are taxable and there is advantage to you in doing this unless you get Income Support as an unemployed person .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #28:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #54:1>
See leaflet NI 92 Earning extra pension by cancelling your retirement .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #55:1>
Providing a service

If you are providing a service by doing : voluntary work , or some paid work , or caring for a child or a sick or elderly person , and you can show that it would be unreason<l>able to give it up immediately if a job was offered to you , you can still be treated as being available for work as long as you are able and willing to give it up at 24 hours ' notice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #57:1>
Seafarers
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #58:1>
You cannot normally get Unemployment Benefit for days at the end of a voyage for which you are entitled to paid leave .

Unemployment Benefit and Income Support may be taxed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #77:1>
If you cannot get , or do not want to claim , Unemployment Benefit ( for example , because you have not paid enough National Insurance contributions or because you do not want to be available for and actively seeking employment ) but want In<l>come Support you should claim it at your local Social Security office .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #78:1>
If you want to keep up your contribution rec<l>ord for benefits in the future , whether or not you are claiming Unemployment Benefit , you can claim credits at the Unemployment Benefit office if you are available for work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #79:1>
See National Insurance credits on page 9 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #80:1>
Men near or over the age of 60
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #81:1>
If you are aged 60 or over , or will reach 60 in the current tax year , there are special arrangements .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #82:1>
Credits :
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #83:1>
National Insurance contributions will be credited to you automatically if you are aged 60 or more and you : do not pay Class 1 contributions as an employee and are not self-employed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #84:1>
The credits will be available from the begin<l>ning of the tax year in which you reach the age of 60 until the end of the tax year in which you reach the age of 64 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #85:1>
They protect your National Insurance record for widows ' bene<l>fits and for Retirement Pension and they will help you to maintain your entitlement to other .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #86:1>
You can also get credits if you are a self<l->employed man aged 60 or over in the current year and you have a current certificate exempting you from paying contributions because of small earnings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #87:1>
See leaflet NI 27A People with small earnings from self-employment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #88:1>
If you go abroad for more than six months ( 182 days ) in any tax year , you will not be given credits for any week in that tax year un<l>less you make a special claim for them ( see below ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #89:1>
Unemployment Benefit :
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #90:1>
If you will be 60 or over in the current tax year and are unemployed , you can claim Unem<l>ployment Benefit as usual .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #91:1>
If you find then or later on that you are not entitled to Unemployment Benefit because : you do not meet the contribution condi<l>tions , or your occupational or personal pension is high enough to stop you getting any benefit , or you have finished your year 's entitle<l>ment , - you do not have to keep claiming at the Unemployment Benefit office to get credits because you will get them automatically .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #92:1>
If you are not entitled to benefit for one of these reasons your Unemployment Benefit office will send you a letter ( form CR 8 ) to explain automatic credits and to say when you can stop claiming .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #93:1>
Keep the letter -
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #94:1>
you may need it later .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #95:1>
If you do not get a letter ask your Unemployment Benefit office for it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #96:1>
If you plan to go , or have been , abroad for more than six months ( 182 days ) in any tax year , you should safeguard your future benefit by making a claim for Unemploy<l>ment Benefit for the part of the tax year you spend in this country .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #97:1>
Once that tax year has ended you will get credits automatically as before , except in any tax year you go abroad again for more than six months .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #98:1>
If you cannot get benefit for one of the reasons given above you will be covered by a special arrangement which will automatically continue your P.I.E .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #99:1>
This is done so that if you claim Unemployment or Sickness Benefit in the future you will be in just the same position as if you had carried on claim<l>ing at the Unemployment Benefit office and got your credits that way .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #100:1>
This means you will not lose any rights you have built up by get<l>ting Sickness or Invalidity Benefit in the P.I.E. - for example , a right to get Invalidity Benefit immediately or quicker than usual if you fall sick in future , or to have Invalidity Allowance added to Invalidity or Retirement Pension .
<ICE-GB:W2D-002 #101:1>
See leaflet NI 16A Invalidity Benefit .

GENERAL INFORMATION
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #3:1>
One of the important things you will have to find out , if you want to take a course leading to a degree or similar qualification when you leave school , is whether you can get a grant , how much it will be , and whether your parents are expected to contribute .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #4:1>
This booklet provides some basic infor<l>mation , but it cannot cover every detail , or every &lsquo; special case &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #5:1>
Further<l>more it is a guide to , not a substitute for The Education ( Mandatory Awards ) Regulations 1 which local education authorities ( LEAs ) use in as<l>sessing your grant entitlement .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #6:1>
1 Copies of the Regulations are available from HMSO or booksellers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #7:1>
The grants system is complex .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #8:1>
Enquiries about individual eligibility for a grant should be addressed to your LEA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #9:1>
What is the difference between an &lsquo; award &rsquo; and a &lsquo; grant &rsquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #10:1>
The two words are often used interchangeably , but the regulations make a distinction between : the award , which comprises both a fee element and a maintenance element and the grant , which represents only the maintenance element
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #11:1>
The fee element of the award normally covers all tuition and other course<l->related fees for which you are liable , and is paid direct to your college or university by the LEA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #12:1>
The maintenance grant is paid to you , for your support during term time and the short vacations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #13:1>
This part of the award is means-tested , as explained below .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #14:1>
So there is a further distinction be<l>tween the gross grant and the net grant actually paid by the LEA , after discounting any assessed contributions from your parents or your spouse , and yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #15:1>
The two types of grant
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #16:1>
This guide deals mainly with mandatory grants .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #17:1>
LEAs in England and Wales are required by law to pay these grants , but only to students who are at<l>tending designated courses , and who are eligible , ie who satisfy the qualifying conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #18:1>
If you are not eligible for a mandatory grant , or are not taking a designated course , you may still qualify for a discretionary grant .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #19:1>
But each local authority decides its own policy on these , and there are no general rules and conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #20:1>
See , however , the short section &lsquo; Discretionary grants &rsquo; on page 6 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #21:1>
What courses do you get a grant for ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #22:1>
Mandatory grants are available for designated courses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #23:1>
In almost all cases these are full-time or sandwich courses ( combining full-time study with periods of full-time training and experience in industry and commerce ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #24:1>
Certain part-time initial teacher training courses may , however , be desig<l>nated for grant purposes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #25:1>
Designated courses are those leading to : &bullet; a first degree of a university in the United Kingdom or of the CNAA , including courses provided jointly by an establishment in the UK and an overseas establishment &bullet; the Diploma of Higher Education &bullet; BTEC Higher National Diploma Awards &bullet; initial teacher-training qualifications including the Postgraduate Certificate in Education or the Art Teachers ' Certificate or Diploma &bullet; a university certificate or diploma , and lasting at least 3 years &bullet; other qualifications if the course is specifically designated as being comparable to a first degree course
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #26:1>
2 A list of courses in this category is available from the Awards Division , Department of Education and Science , Elizabeth House , York Road , London SE1 7PH
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #27:1>
Courses for certain professions supplementary to medicine
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #28:1>
Grants for degree and non-degree courses for occupational therapists , physiotherapists , radiographers , orthoptists , dental hygienists or dental therapists , are administered by the Department of Health .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #29:1>
The rules adopted by the Department of Health follow those which apply for manda<l>tory awards and this booklet serves as a guide only .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #30:1>
Further information regarding grants for these courses is available from : Department of Health , Student Grants Department , North Fylde Central Office , Norcross , Blackpool FY5 3TA
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #31:1>
If you receive a grant or bursary from the Department of Health you will not be eligible for an award from your LEA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #32:1>
If you do not receive an award from the Department of Health you may still be eligible for an award from your LEA for certain courses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #33:1>
Courses not covered by this guide
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #34:1>
The information in this guide does not apply to grants for : postgraduate studies 3 ( except postgraduate initial teacher training ) &ldquo; Project 2000 &rdquo; nurse education and training courses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #35:1>
Bursaries for these courses are administered by health authorities which run such courses in Schools or Colleges of Nursing and Midwifery.
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #36:1>
The information in this guide does not apply to grants for : courses of adult education at the long-term residential adult education colleges 4 courses of further education .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #37:1>
3 For information about grants for these courses write to the relevant Research Councils or to the DES at the address on page 1 from whom the addresses of the research councils - Agriculture and Food , Economic and Social , Medical , Natural Environment , Science and Engineering - can be obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #38:1>
4 Write to The Awards Officer , Adult Education Bursaries , Ruskin College , Oxford OX1 2HE .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #39:1>
Examples of these are : GCSE and Advanced levels &semi; BTEC National Awards ( as distinct from Higher National Certificates and Diplomas ) &semi; City and Guilds courses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #40:1>
However , your own LEA may be prepared to offer a discretionary award for these courses ( see &lsquo; Discretionary grants &rsquo; on page 7 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #41:1>
Who gets a grant ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #42:1>
To get a mandatory grant you have to be eligible as well as having been admitted to a designated course .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #43:1>
The final decision on whether or not you are eligible rests with the LEA , but you will probably qualify if : &bullet; You have been ordinarily resident in the British Islands for the 3 years preceding the academic year in which the course begins .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #44:1>
If you were absent only because you or your family were temporarily employed abroad , you will be treated as if your ordinary residence in the British Islands had not been interrupted .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #45:1>
If you were primarily here to receive full-time education ( and would normally be elsewhere ) , you will not be regarded as having been ordinarily resident here .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #46:1>
In either case , you should ask your LEA for advice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #47:1>
A supplementary fact sheet about awards for UK citizens working overseas is available from the Department of Education and Science at the address given in footnote 2 on page 3 of this guide &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #48:1>
the fact sheet includes advice on which LEA is responsible if you have been tempo<l>rarily absent from the UK .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #49:1>
See also the section below on &lsquo; Students from abroad &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #50:1>
The final decision on whether or not you are eligible rests with the LEA , but you will probably qualify if : &black-square; You have not previously attended , with a grant , a course of higher education of more than 2 years .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #51:1>
You will have to tell your LEA of any previous full-time course of post A-level study .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #52:1>
Attendance with a grant for a period of one term and seven weeks of a second term , or less , is disregarded .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #53:1>
If you have previously attended a course of higher education of up to 2 years this may reduce the period for which your grant is payable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #54:1>
This rule does not apply to students taking the Postgraduate Certificate in Education , the Art Teachers ' Certificate or Diploma or a shortened ( 2-year ) course for the Bachelor of Education .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #55:1>
The final decision on whether or not you are eligible rests with the LEA , but you will probably qualify if : &black-square; You get your grant application in on time -
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #56:1>
at the very latest this should reach your home LEA before the end of the first term .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #57:1>
You can generally apply from March onwards .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #58:1>
The final decision on whether or not you are eligible rests with the LEA , but you will probably qualify if : &black-square; You give the LEA a written undertaking to repay any money which has , for whatever reason , been paid in excess of your entitlement .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #59:1>
The final decision on whether or not you are eligible rests with the LEA , but you will probably qualify if : &black-square; You have not , in the authority 's opinion , shown yourself by your conduct to be unfitted to receive an award .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #60:1>
Note that a mandatory grant is normally given for a course , of any length , not for a particular numbers number of years .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #61:1>
However , if you make a false start , your award can sometimes be transferred to another course .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #62:1>
If you wish to transfer your award it is important that you consult both your institution and LEA as soon as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #63:1>
Students from abroad
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #64:1>
Students attending designated courses and who do not satisfy the require<l>ments for ordinary residence in the UK may nevertheless be eligible for assistance in certain circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #65:1>
Mandatory grants may be payable to : &black-square; British nationals returning from work in other EC states &black-square; Students from other member states of the European Community who can establish &lsquo; migrant worker &rsquo; status , or whose parents are migrant workers &black-square; Refugees , asylees and their spouses and children .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #66:1>
Students who are , or whose parents are , EC nationals , who have been or<l>dinarily resident in other member states of the European Community during the 3 years preceding the academic year in which the course begins , and who satisfy the requirements ( other than ordinary residence in the UK ) that UK students must satisfy to be eligible for grant , will not have to pay their fees .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #67:1>
Intending students in these categories should seek advice from their LEA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #68:1>
You should consult your LEA if you think you are in this category .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #69:1>
Your institution will be able to help you in deciding which LEA will be respon<l>sible for considering an application from you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #70:1>
Discretionary grants
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #71:1>
Your LEA may still give you a discretionary grant if you fail to satisfy the mandatory regulations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #72:1>
To help them make their decision you will need to explain your circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #73:1>
If they do decide to give you a discretionary grant for a designated course it will be for the same amount and conditions as if you were eligible for a mandatory grant &semi; but the amount and condi<l>tions of a discretionary grant for a non-designated course are determined by the LEA and may not be the same as a mandatory grant .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #74:1>
Students who are , or whose parents are , EC nationals and who have been ordinarily resident in other member states of the European Community during the 3 years preceding the academic year in which the course begins will be eligible to be considered for discretionary awards for fees for non-designated courses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #75:1>
Discretionary grants are sometimes competitive so your examination results may be taken into account .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #76:1>
And you may be expected to study locally if a course similar to the one you want to take is available nearer your home .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #77:1>
These restrictions do not apply to mandatory grants .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #78:1>
If you decide either to stay on at school beyond age 16 or go to the local further education college , and if this is likely to cause your parents hard<l>ship , local authorities can make a special grant towards the cost of maintenance - that is , your living expenses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #79:1>
The amount of the grant is likely to be small , and it will depend on your parents ' income .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #80:1>
If you want to find out whether you qualify , either you or your parents should write to the LEA for the area in which you live .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #81:1>
THE GRANT YOU WILL RECEIVE
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #82:1>
How much grant will you get ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #83:1>
Your LEA will assess your &lsquo; maintenance requirements &rsquo; and your &lsquo; resources &rsquo; and subtract one from the other :
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #84:1>
whatever is left is your net grant .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #85:1>
Your &lsquo; maintenance requirements &rsquo; consist of the basic rate of maintenance grant , depending on where you will live while studying , plus any of the additional allowances you may be able to claim .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #86:1>
Your &lsquo; resources &rsquo; include any income of your own ( but not earnings from work - see the section &lsquo; Your own income &rsquo; on page 11 ) , subject to certain allowable deductions , and any assessed contributions from your parents or your spouse , based on their income .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #87:1>
The standard rates of grant , additional allowances , contribution scales and allowable deductions are all specified in the man<l>datory awards regulations , which are reviewed and revised annually .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #88:1>
Basic grant rates
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #89:1>
The standard rates of maintenance grant for the academic year 1990-91 are : &pound-sign;2,265 if you are living in a hall of residence or in lodgings and studying at a college or other establishment outside the London area ( the area covered by the Metropolitan Police District ) &pound-sign;2,845 as above but attending an establishment within the London area &pound-sign;1,795 if you are living at your parents ' home .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #90:1>
LEAs also reserve the right , except in the case of married students or those with &lsquo; independent status &rsquo; , to award this grant to those who could live at home and travel to their place of study daily but prefer to live away from the parental home ( see page 13 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #91:1>
Overseas study
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #92:1>
If the course requires you to study at an institution abroad for at least one term the grant you receive will depend on the country in which you are staying .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #93:1>
But in any case consult your LEA for advice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-003 #94:1>
The rates applicable are : Highest-cost countries : &pound-sign;3,425 per annum ( Denmark , Finland , Japan , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland and Taiwan ) Higher-cost countries : &pound-sign;3,080 ( Australia , Austria , Belgium , France , Federal Republic of Germany , Iceland , the Republic of Ireland , and Netherlands ) High-cost countries : &pound-sign;2,670 ( Canada , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Italy , Luxembourg , New Zealand , USA and USSR ) All other countries : &pound-sign;2,265

<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #7:1>
This starts on the first Sunday in January and usually ends on the first Saturday of the next year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #8:1>
( The first day of your period of interruption of employment - see leaflet NI 12 Unemployment Benefit - determines your benefit year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #9:1>
If your period of interruption of employment links with an earlier period , it is the first day of the earlier period which deter<l>mines your benefit year . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #10:1>
&bullet; Lower earnings limit
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #11:1>
If you work for an employer and earn at least a certain amount , called the lower earnings limit , you have to pay Class 1 contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #12:1>
The current lower earnings limit is given in leaflet NI 196 Social Security benefit rates .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #13:1>
&bullet; Pension age
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #14:1>
This is 60 for women and 65 for men .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #15:1>
&bullet; Qualifying earnings
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #16:1>
These are earnings on which standard<l->rate Class 1 contributions have been paid .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #17:1>
Qualifying earnings may also be credited ( treated as paid ) - for example , on account of sickness or unemployment - but only to the level needed to make the year a qualifying one .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #18:1>
Each credit 2 or Class 3 contribution is worth qualifying earnings equal to the weekly lower earnings limit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #19:1>
&bullet; Qualifying year
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #20:1>
This is a tax year in which you have received ( or are treated as having received ) qualifying earnings of at least 52 times the weekly lower earnings limit for that year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #21:1>
A qualifying year counts for Retirement Pension and , widow 's benefits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #22:1>
&bullet; Reduced liability
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #23:1>
This applies to some married women and widows who have the right to pay no Class 2 contributions when self-employed , and reduced rate Class 1 contributions when employed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #24:1>
&bullet; Relevant tax years
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #25:1>
These are the last two tax years before the start of your benefit year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #26:1>
Your benefit will be based on your National Insurance con<l>tributions during these tax years .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #27:1>
&bullet; Tax year
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #28:1>
This starts on 6 April and ends on 5 April of the following year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #29:1>
&bullet; Upper earnings limit
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #30:1>
If you work for an employer and earn more than an amount , called the upper earnings limit , you have to pay Class 1 contribu<l>tions only up to that limit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #31:1>
The current upper earnings limit is given in leaflet NI 196 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #32:1>
&bullet; Working lif Working life
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #33:1>
For National Insurance purposes , your working life is the number of tax years from the beginning of the tax year in which you reached the age of 16 up to the end of the one before you reach pension age ( or death , if earlier ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #34:1>
It is normally 44 years for women and 49 years for men , but may be less if you were over 16 when the National Insurance scheme started on 5 July 1948 ( that is , you were born before 5 July 1932 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #35:1>
National Insurance contributions :
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #36:1>
where do you fit in ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #37:1>
Most working people have to pay National Insurance contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #38:1>
There are four dif<l>ferent kinds .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #39:1>
In the course of your working life , you may need to change from one kind to another or have to pay more than one kind at the same time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #40:1>
Sometimes , your right to National Insurance benefits can be protected even if you cannot pay contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #41:1>
It is important for you to know where you fit in .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #42:1>
Class 1 contributions
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #43:1>
You and your employer , or the person treated as your employer ( see &lsquo; Class 1 con<l>tributions &rsquo; on page 6 ) must pay these if your earnings reach the lower earnings limit for Class 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #44:1>
They are paid on all your earnings up to an upper limit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #45:1>
You will pay contributions at a lower ( initial ) percentage rate on earnings equal to the lower earnings limit , and at a single higher ( main ) percentage rate on earnings between the lower earnings limit and the upper earn<l>ings limit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #46:1>
Class 1 contributions are earnings-related -
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #47:1>
the amount you pay depends on the amount you earn .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #48:1>
See NI 196 Social Security benefit rates .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #49:1>
Class 2 contributions
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #50:1>
You must pay these if you are normally self-employed , unless you have applied for and been granted exception because your earn<l>ings are below the exception limit for Class 2 contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #51:1>
If you are excepted you may , if you wish , pay Class 2 contributions volun<l>tarily to keep up your right to the benefits they provide .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #52:1>
Class 2 contributions are paid at a flat rate -
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #53:1>
you pay the same amount however much you earn .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #54:1>
Class 3 contributions
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #55:1>
You may pay these voluntarily to help you qualify for basic Retirement Pension or widows ' benefits , if : &bullet; you are not liable for contributions &semi; or &bullet; you have been excepted from Class 2 con<l>tributions &semi; or &bullet; your contribution record is not good enough to qualify for benefit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #56:1>
Class 3 contributions are paid at a flat rate .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #57:1>
Class 4 contributions
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #58:1>
Self-employed people whose profits or gains are over a certain amount may have to pay Class 4 contributions as well as Class 2 con<l>tributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #59:1>
Class 4 contributions are earnings-related and are generally assessed and collected by Inland Revenue .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #60:1>
See NP 18 Class 4 National Insurance contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #61:1>
National lnsurance credits
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #62:1>
You may be entitled to credits instead of hav<l>ing to pay contributions if you are : &bullet; unemployed or sick , or in certain circum<l>stances getting Statutory Sick Pay from your employer ( but you may have to send in sick notes to your local Social Security office , or sign on at the Unemployment Benefit office , to get the credits ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #63:1>
or You may be entitled to credits instead of hav<l>ing to pay contributions if you are : &bullet; entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay , Maternity Allowance , Invalid Care Allow<l>ance or unemployability supplement &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #64:1>
or You may be entitled to credits instead of hav<l>ing to pay contributions if you are : &bullet; taking an approved course of training ( see leaflet NI 125 Training for further em<l>ployment and your National Insurance record ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #65:1>
or you may be entitled to credits instead of hav<l>ing to pay contributions if you are : &bullet; a man aged 60 or over - see page 4 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #66:1>
If you are a young person who has recently left full-time education or training , but are not yet working , you may be able to get credits to help you qualify for Sickness or Unemployment Benefit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #67:1>
Credits count only for basic benefits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #68:1>
And they count for Sickness and Unemployment Benefits only in certain circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #69:1>
Also , for most benefits , it is a condition that a cer<l>tain amount of contributions must actually have been paid &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #70:1>
credits do not count for this purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #71:1>
Married women and widows
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #72:1>
Married women and some widows used to be able to choose to pay Class 1 contribu<l>tions at a reduced rate when employed , and to pay no Class 2 when self-employed ( though Class 4 were still payable in full ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #73:1>
This was called &lsquo; √´ reduced liability &rsquo; √≠ .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #74:1>
This choice is no longer available , but if you already had reduced liability on 5 April 1978 you may keep it , unless : &bullet; your marriage ends in divorce &semi; or &bullet; your widow 's benefit ends ( other than on re-marriage ) &semi; or &bullet; for two consecutive tax years , you have not had any employment for which you had to pay Class 1 contributions , nor any self-employment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #75:1>
You may voluntarily give up your right to reduced liability .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #76:1>
You might wish to do this because , while you have it : &bullet; any Class 1 contributions you pay at a reduced rate do not count for benefit &semi; and &bullet; you cannot get Home Responsibilities Protection &semi; and &bullet; you are not allowed to pay voluntary con<l>tributions &semi; and &bullet; if you are a married woman , you cannot get credits ( widows can get credits ) &semi; and &bullet; from October 1989 you could pay more in than colleagues with the same earnings but paying standard rate .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #77:1>
This would affect those women earning less than about &pound-sign;58.50 a week ( &pound-sign;68.25 for women in contracted-out employment ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #78:1>
This is because changes were made to the standard rate contributions paid by employees that do not affect the married woman 's reduced rate contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #79:1>
Special provisions for men approaching 60 , or over the age of 60
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #80:1>
If you are aged 60 or over , or will reach age 60 in the current tax year , special provisions will apply .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #81:1>
Credits
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #82:1>
If you are a man aged 60 or over you will get credits automatically to cover any period when you do not have to pay National Insur<l>ance contributions ( except for any tax year during which you are abroad for more than six months ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #83:1>
If you are unemployed you do not have to claim at the Unemployment Benefit office or be available for work to get these credits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #84:1>
They will protect your National Insurance record for basic Retire<l>ment Pension and widows ' benefits ( for your wife ) and they will also assist you to maintain your entitlement to other benefits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #85:1>
If you are abroad for more than six months ( 182 days ) in any tax year you will not be given automatic credits for any week in that tax year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #86:1>
If you plan to go , or have been , abroad for more than six months in any tax year you should safeguard your future benefit by making a claim for Unemployment Benefit ( or Sickness Benefit if you are sick ) and so get credits for that part of the tax year you spend in this country .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #87:1>
Once that tax year has ended , you will get credits automatically as before , except during any tax year in which you go abroad again for more than six months ( see leaflet NI 12 Unemployment Benefit ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #88:1>
Unemployment Benefit
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #89:1>
If you are over age 60 , or will be 60 in the cur<l>rent tax year , and you are unemployed you may claim Unemployment Benefit as usual .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #90:1>
But if you find then or later that you are not entitled to any Unemployment Benefit because : &bullet; you do not satisfy the contribution conditions &semi; or &bullet; your occupational or personal pension is high enough to stop you getting any benefit &semi; or &bullet; you have finished your year 's entitlement &semi; you no longer have to keep claiming at the Unemployment Benefit office ( UBO ) to get credits as these will be given to you automati<l>cally .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #91:1>
If you are not entitled to benefit for one of the reasons above , your UBO will send you a letter ( form CR8 ) to explain automatic credits and to say when you can stop claim<l>ing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #92:1>
Keep that letter -
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #93:1>
you may need it later .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #94:1>
If you do not get a letter , ask your UBO for it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #95:1>
If your benefit claim is disallowed for one of the reasons given above you will also be covered by a special arrangement which will automatically continue your period of inter<l>ruption of employment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #96:1>
( The meaning of this is explained in leaflet NI 12 . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #97:1>
This is done so that if you claim Unemploy<l>ment or Sickness Benefit in the future , you will be in just the same position as if you had carried on claiming at the UBO and got your credits that way .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #98:1>
This means you will not lose any rights you have built up through getting Sickness or Invalidity Benefit earlier in the period of interruption of employment - for example a right to get Invalidity Benefit immediately or quicker than usual if you fall sick in future , or to have Invalidity Allow<l>ance added on to Invalidity or Retirement Pension .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #99:1>
( See leaflet NI 16A Invalidity Ben<l>efit . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #100:1>
This automatic period of interruption of employment will continue until you qual<l>ify for your Retirement Pension unless you are employed or self-employed for a contin<l>uous period of more than eight weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #101:1>
In this case the automatic period of interruption of employment will end the day you started work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #102:1>
If you become unemployed again and claim Unemployment Benefit but your claim is disallowed for one of the reasons set out at the start of this section you will again start an automatic period of interruption of employment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #103:1>
Home Responsibilities Protection
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #104:1>
If you are staying at home to look after child<l>ren or a sick or elderly person , you may qualify for Home Responsibilities Protec<l>tion , which helps to protect your rights to basic Retirement Pension ( and widows ' benefits for your wife ) if you are not paying contributions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #105:1>
You are entitled to this protection if , during the whole of any tax year , you : &bullet; received Child Benefit , as the main payee , for a child under 16
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #106:1>
or you are entitled to this protection if , during the whole of any tax year , you : &bullet; regularly cared ( for at least 35 hours a week ) for a person who was getting either Constant Attendance Allowance or , if over age 16 , Attendance Allowance ( though if you are able to get Invalid Care Allowance for doing this you will get credits and need not claim Home Responsibilities Protection ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #107:1>
or you are entitled to this protection if , during the whole of any tax year , you : &bullet; received Income Support to enable you to care for an elderly or incapacitated per<l>son at home &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-004 #108:1>
or you are entitled to this protection if , during the whole of any tax year , you : &bullet; were covered by a combination of any of these conditions .

Introduction to Family Credit
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #2:1>
Family Credit is a regular weekly tax-free non-contributory benefit paid to employed or self-employed people who are responsible for at least one child under 16 ( or under 19 if in full-time education ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #3:1>
( Non-contributory means that you don't need to have paid National Insurance contributions to qualify . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #4:1>
You may be married or unmarried , living with a partner , or living alone .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #5:1>
It is not a loan and so does not have to be paid back .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #6:1>
The amount of Family Credit you get will depend on the amount of your financial resources such as your earnings and savings and on the number and ages of your children .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #7:1>
If you or your partner are getting a National Insurance benefit , such as Unemployment Benefit , you may be able to get Family Credit as well ( provided that one of you is working ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #8:1>
Family Credit is paid for out of the Social Security scheme to which everyone contributes in the form of taxes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #9:1>
It is your right to claim Family Credit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #10:1>
Your partner
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #11:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987 . 2
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #12:1>
Wherever the term partner is used in this leaflet , it means your husband , wife , or someone you live with as if you were married to them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #13:1>
The main Family Credit rules
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #14:1>
All claimants have to satisfy the following five rules to be able to get Family Credit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #15:1>
The rules are explained in more detail under their own section headings ( as shown in &lsquo; Contents &rsquo; list ) .

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #19:1>
During the period when you are entitled to Family Credit under the law of Northern Ireland , you cannot be treated as resident in Great Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #20:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #26:1>
Rule 4 : Income
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #27:1>
Family Credit is income related .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #28:1>
This means that the amount of Family Credit you get depends on your normal net earnings and those of your partner and any other income you and your partner have .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #29:1>
Not all of this income will be taken into account and some kinds of income are ignored completely .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #30:1>
Rule 5 : Capital
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #31:1>
You and your partner together must not have more than &pound-sign;8,000 in capital .

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #41:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987 . 4
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #42:1>
You or your partner must be engaged in and normally engaged in remunerative work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #43:1>
For Family Credit purposes , remunerative work is defined as work of not less than 24 hours a week , on average , for which payment is made or which is done in expectation of payment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #44:1>
This work may be in more than one job and may be done by either partner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #45:1>
But you cannot add together the hours worked by both you and your partner to achieve the minimum requirement of 24 hours .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #46:1>
Engaged in remunerative work
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #47:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.5 ( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #48:1>
To satisfy the engaged rule , whichever of you fulfils the work conditions must actually work 24 hours or more during the week of claim , or during either of the two weeks immediately preceding the week of claim , and must be employed at the date of claim .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #49:1>
For example , although you may be receiving your pay while off sick or on holiday or short-time working during that period , you will not satisfy the engaged rule unless you actually work for 24 hours in one of those weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #50:1>
The week of claim means the week , starting on a Sunday , which includes the date on which the claim is made : that is , received at a Social Security office .

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #52:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.5 ( 2 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #53:1>
To satisfy the &lsquo; normally engaged &rsquo; rule , the work in which you are engaged must be your normal and be likely to last for at least 5 weeks from the week of claim .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #54:1>
Paid or in expectation of payment
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #55:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.4 ( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #56:1>
Remunerative work is work for which payment is made , or reasonably expected to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #57:1>
For example : if you are self-employed and reasonably expect to be paid for work done , or a payment has been received ( for example as a trading receipt ) , the Adjudication Officer may regard this as work in expectation of payment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #58:1>
Payment in kind
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #59:1>
If you work without cash payment but receive payment in kind , for example free accommodation as a housekeeper , this work is treated as remunerative work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #60:1>
See page 16
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #61:1>
&lsquo; Accommodation &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #62:1>
Charity or voluntary work
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #63:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.5 ( 3 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #64:1>
If you work for a charity or voluntary body or as a volunteer you cannot be treated as doing remunerative work ( that is , in expectation of payment ) unless you receive or are due a reward in cash or in kind .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #65:1>
Refunded expenses are not treated as earnings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #66:1>
Foster parents
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #67:1>
You will be treated as being in remunerative work as a foster parent only if your earnings are payable under a contract of employment or for services ( that is , from a local authority ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #68:1>
Working at home
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #69:1>
If you work mainly at home , for example as a child<l->minder , boarding-house keeper or author , and work on average at least 24 hours a week in remunerative work , you may still satisfy the remunerative work rule .

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #72:1>
If you attend such a scheme the time spent is not treated as time spent in employment and does not count for the purposes of the remunerative work rule .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #73:1>
People on such schemes will not normally be able to satisfy the remunerative work rule .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #74:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #75:1>
Establishing hours of work
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #76:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.4(2)
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #77:1>
If your contracted hours of work fluctuate , an average will be taken based on a recognisable cycle of work if there is one .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #78:1>
For example , if you are working one week on , one week off , the average would be taken over the fortnightly cycle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #79:1>
If there is no recognisable cycle , the average would be taken over the period of five weeks immediately preceding the week in which the claim is received , providing this is truly representative .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #80:1>
The five-week period can be departed from if a more meaningful period can be found .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #81:1>
More than one job
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #82:1>
If you have more than one job , the average hours will be added together to decide whether you satisfy the remunerative work rule .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #83:1>
New job
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #84:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987 4 ( 2 ) ( a )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #85:1>
If you have just started a new job and no recognisable cycle of hours is yet established , the average number of hours you expect to work is taken .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #86:1>
Holidays and other absences
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #87:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.4(3)
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #88:1>
Recognised holidays , bank holidays or summer holidays are taken into account when calculating an average .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #89:1>
Other absences from work such as sick leave will not count towards a cycle or average .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #90:1>
Self-employed
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #91:1>
This means working for yourself in remunerative work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #92:1>
For Family Credit it also means for 24 hours or more a week .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #93:1>
This time can include time costed to clients and essential business activities such as vehicle maintenance , visits to clients or trips to wholesalers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #94:1>
Responsibility for a child ( Rule 3 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #95:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.7
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #96:1>
Children under 16
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #97:1>
Children under 16 who are living with you are included in your family if you , or your partner , are responsible for them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #98:1>
This means that the needs of the child or children will normally be taken into account ( see the exceptions listed below ) in the calculation of your Family Credit payment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #99:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.8
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #100:1>
You , or your partner , do not have to be the parents of the children as long as the children live with you as members of your household .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #101:1>
Young people aged 16 to 18
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #102:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.6
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #103:1>
The same rules apply to young people aged 16 to 18 who are living with you and are in full-time education up to A-level or equivalent standard .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #104:1>
You cannot get Family Credit for them if they can claim Income Support in their own right ( see page 43 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #105:1>
If a young person has reached 19 at the date of your claim for Family Credit they cannot be included in the family for Family Credit purposes (
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #106:1>
the date of claim is the date the claim is received at a Social Security office ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #107:1>
You cannot include a young person in any claim for Family Credit if he or she has left non-advanced full-time education , even if Child Benefit is still in payment for him or her , and they have not yet started work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #108:1>
Who is responsible ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #109:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.7(3)
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #110:1>
For Family Credit purposes , a child or young person can only be included in one claim for Family Credit at any time because only one person can be responsible for that child or young person .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #111:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.7(2)
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #112:1>
A person is treated as responsible for a child or young person who is normally living with him or her .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #113:1>
If the child or young person spends equal amounts of time in different households , or if there is doubt about which household he or she is living in , he or she is treated as the responsibility of the person getting or claiming Child Benefit for him or her &semi; or , failing that , the person who has primary responsibility for him or her .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #114:1>
When you are not responsible for the child or young person
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #115:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.8(2)
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #116:1>
If the child or young person is not living with you , you can only get Family Credit for him or her in certain situations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #117:1>
You will not be treated as responsible for the child or young person and therefore cannot get Family Credit for him or her if : he or she is being fostered by you while you wait to adopt , or he or she is staying with you to attend school or college and is not dependent on you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #118:1>
If a child or young person is temporarily absent from your family he or she will not be treated as your dependant if : he or she has been in hospital , or residential accommodation , for at least 12 weeks and your family has not been in regular contact , or he or she is in legal custody under a sentence imposed by a court .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #119:1>
Except for the situations listed above , if he or she is living away from home you should be able to get Family Credit for them if you can get Child Benefit for them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #120:1>
Income ( Rule 4 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #121:1>
A claimant 's income
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #122:1>
Income is all the money that is coming in from earnings , Social Security benefits , maintenance payments and other sources .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #123:1>
Depending on the type of income , it is either ignored completely in the calculation of your Family Credit , ignored partially ( the disregards ) or taken fully into account .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #124:1>
If you have no income above a set level , you will get the maximum benefit appropriate to your size of family .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #125:1>
If you do have some income above that level it will reduce your benefit to less than the maximum ( see page 38 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #126:1>
Assessing your income is therefore essential in deciding how much Family Credit you can be paid .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #127:1>
Income is treated on a weekly basis .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #128:1>
Where the payment of income clearly covers a set period of time , the payment is broken down into weekly amounts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #129:1>
These make up the normal weekly income , which ( less any disregards ) will be taken into account in calculating your Family Credit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #130:1>
FC ( Gen ) Regs 1987.10
<ICE-GB:W2D-005 #131:1>
The incomes of you and your partner are added together for Family Credit purposes .

Safety Tips
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #36:1>
Trust your intuition
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #37:1>
If you are scared or uneasy , do not ignore the feeling .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #38:1>
Forget your inhib<l>itions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #39:1>
Act straight away .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #40:1>
Your safety is more important than your image .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #41:1>
Plan ahead
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #42:1>
Have the right change for your fare with you so that you do not have to fumble in your wallet or bag .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #43:1>
If you buy your ticket from an office , put your change/card/cheque book away safely before leaving the till .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #44:1>
Consider buying a season ticket -
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #45:1>
you 'll need to find your money less often .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #46:1>
It 's a good idea to carry a phone card , too .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #47:1>
Whenever possible , travel in a group or with someone you know .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #48:1>
When getting off a bus or a train at night , attach yourself to groups of people also leaving and walk purposefully to your destination .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #49:1>
Or arrange for a friend or a taxi to meet you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #50:1>
Know where you are going and which stop you need .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #51:1>
If you look at a map it shows that you don't know the area and may leave you open to dubious offers of help .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #52:1>
Carry a personal alarm and know how to use it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #53:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #59:1>
Defend yourself physically only if really necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #60:1>
Meeting aggres<l>sion with can be very dangerous .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #61:1>
Your primary aim should always be to GET AWAY .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #62:1>
Avoid putting yourself at risk
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #63:1>
Make sure you do not present yourself as an easy target &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #64:1>
we have listed a few suggestions opposite .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #65:1>
&arrowhead; Wear shoes that are easy to walk and run in .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #66:1>
Avoid clothes that could stop you running .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #67:1>
&arrowhead; Try to keep both hands free .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #68:1>
Don't walk with both hands in your pockets .

&arrowhead; Think about the impact your clothes may have on others .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #70:1>
&arrowhead; Don't wear a personal stereo ,

<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #72:1>
&arrowhead; Take good care of your belongings at all times .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #73:1>
&arrowhead; Use a bag that will go over your shoulder , or wear a small one across your body under a jacket or coat or a shoulder bag with a short strong strap and good fastenings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #74:1>
Make sure it sits close to your body with the fastenings next to you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #75:1>
&arrowhead; Carry essential valuables such as wallets in an inside pocket secured with a safety pin .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #76:1>
This is an infallible way to stop pickpockets .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #77:1>
Or use a body belt or a bum bag .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #78:1>
Keep jewellery out of sight .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #79:1>
&arrowhead; Be cautious in conversation with strangers and avoid being overheard .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #80:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #81:1>
&arrowhead; Remember that alcohol affects your judgement of both people and situations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #82:1>
Know your limits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #83:1>
&arrowhead; For your ease of mind and for those your you care about , leave behind in an accessible place all the details you think would be helpful to the police if anything unfortunate did happen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #84:1>
Buses
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #85:1>
Every year there are six billion journeys on Britain 's buses and coaches :
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #86:1>
the vast majority of passengers travel in complete safety .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #87:1>
Buses are well lit , easy to see into from outside , and pick up and set down passengers at regular intervals , reducing the chances of violence or robbery .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #88:1>
Criminals prefer anonymity and are less likely to get to work where there is a chance of being recognised .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #89:1>
The layout of buses makes a quick getaway by trouble-makers difficult or even impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #90:1>
Where the doors are controlled by the driver , he can keep them closed or open them according to what is best in the circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #91:1>
On long express journeys by coach , the sixty or so passengers can be screened for danger signs before they board .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #92:1>
Nevertheless , while it is clear that the real dangers to travellers occur before boarding or after getting off the bus or coach , operators are aware of the potential for violence that exists in any society .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #93:1>
They urge all passengers to take the following simple precautions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #94:1>
&arrowhead; When waiting for a bus at night , stand in a well lit place near groups of people .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #95:1>
&arrowhead; On the bus , sit near the driver and choose an aisle seat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #96:1>
On a double-decker the lower deck is preferable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #97:1>
&arrowhead; If there is an incident on a bus , make a fuss straight away .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #98:1>
The driver can alert the police or head office if he has a radio .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #99:1>
&arrowhead; Very occasionally buses are terminated before the stop where you intend to get off .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #100:1>
Carry extra money on your person ( not in your bag ) to avoid being stranded .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #101:1>
&arrowhead; Bus companies issue service timetables and generally have well publicised phone numbers for daily bus enquiries .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #102:1>
Use both of these so that you are clear about the journey you are to take , particularly late at night or in unfamiliar areas , and be punctual so as to reduce waiting time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #103:1>
&arrowhead; If you know that you are likely to be alone when you get off a bus at a remote destination , try to arrange for someone to meet you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #104:1>
London Underground
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #105:1>
Research shows that many people have fears for their safety when travelling on the Underground .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #106:1>
Statistics show that crime levels are no greater than in the rest of society .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #107:1>
Some people 's fears arise from a natural dislike of being underground .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #108:1>
London Underground are intro<l>ducing a range of passenger security measures throughout the network with the help of Government grants .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #109:1>
Together with increased and improved policing and the modernisation of stations and trains , this is having significant success in improving safety and further reducing crime .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #110:1>
Taking care of yourself
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #111:1>
In addition to following the general safety tips provided earlier in this booklet , there are a number of additional things you can do to help if you are worried about your security on the Underground .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #112:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Increasing the Underground Division of the British Transport Police to over 400 officers , many working in known problem areas .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #113:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Forming links with local crime prevention panels , safe transport groups and other local community initiatives to strengthen crime prevention efforts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #114:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Introducing closed-circuit TV and two-way radios .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #115:1>
Measures include : Progressively installing Help Points with emergency and information buttons at key points in stations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #116:1>
Staff receive specific training in passenger security-related matters as the new equipment is introduced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #117:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Clearly marking staff offices .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #118:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Creating supervised waiting areas at quieter stations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #119:1>
Measures include : Installing public telephones on all platforms by 1992 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #120:1>
Public telephones are already available in all ticket halls .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #121:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Giving new trains improved visibility between carriages and intercom facilities to enable passengers to talk to drivers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #122:1>
All trains have communications between the driver and the Line Controller .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #123:1>
Measures include : &arrowhead; Launching a Freephone crime reporting line ( 0800 252525 ) for passengers to report incidents or to provide information on crimes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #124:1>
Callers may be eligible for a London Underground reward .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #125:1>
&arrowhead; Wait for the train in a well lit place near groups of people .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #126:1>
&arrowhead; London Underground are installing improved lighting and mirrors in passageways .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #127:1>
Make use of the mirrors to see round corners .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #128:1>
&arrowhead; If you can , plan your journey ahead and choose a carriage which will stop near the platform exit at your destination .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #129:1>
&arrowhead; If you feel uncomfortable with your fellow passengers , move to another carriage at the next station .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #130:1>
If you are molested on a crowded train , make a fuss straight away .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #131:1>
&arrowhead; If there is an incident on a train , act at once .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #132:1>
Shout for someone to pull the alarm so that you can receive help more quickly when you reach the next station .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #133:1>
&arrowhead; Get to know the position of the emergency alarm when you get on the train .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #134:1>
London Underground are standardising alarms on trains .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #135:1>
There are now push-button and pull-down alarm handles :
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #136:1>
in an emergency , follow the simple directions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #137:1>
&arrowhead; If you see an incident on the platform , look for a Help Point ( already introduced at some stations ) and press the emergency button for help .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #138:1>
Station staff will normally be available in the ticket hall .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #139:1>
&arrowhead; Look out for station staff or British Transport Police or ask the driver to contact the Line Controller if you need help .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #140:1>
British Rail
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #141:1>
Although crime on the railways is rare , British Rail knows from its research that many of its customers are sometimes apprehensive , particularly when travelling late in the evening .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #142:1>
BR recognises that a clean environment not only is welcoming to travellers , but discourages crime .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #143:1>
That is why new stations and new trains are light and airy , to help passengers feel less threatened .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #144:1>
BR 's policy is to get rid of the twilight atmosphere of the old stations and trains which the modern railway inherited , and to replace it with a clean , light environment in which people feel more confident .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #145:1>
As well as providing new trains , BR is improving lighting on stations and in some cases installing closed circuit television systems , linked to police offices .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #146:1>
Public telephones are available at many stations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #147:1>
Instead of old-fashioned guards , BR is now introducing conductors to look after passengers on some trains .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #148:1>
Teams of ticket inspectors work on the driver-only trains on Network SouthEast services .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #149:1>
They appear &ldquo; from nowhere &rdquo; - as many fare dodgers know to their cost - and that element of surprise is a powerful deterrent to criminals .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #150:1>
Driver-only trains are in constant radio contact with base and can summon the police at a moment 's notice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #151:1>
&arrowhead; Follow the safety tips provided earlier in this booklet .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #152:1>
If you feel you 're in danger , remember that BR would rather your train were delayed than that you became the victim of a crime .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #153:1>
Nonetheless , there are additional things you can do to help you feel more secure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #154:1>
&arrowhead; Remember that other people may be just as apprehensive as you are :
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #155:1>
help each other by sitting close - but not so close that they may feel threatened by you !
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #156:1>
&arrowhead; Avoid travelling in compartments with no access to corridors and other parts of the train .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #157:1>
These are being phased out but there are still a few left -
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #158:1>
the compartment-only sections on Network SouthEast services have a red stripe above the door .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #159:1>
A train will always have alternative open carriages .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #160:1>
&arrowhead; Don't be afraid to pull the communication cord or alarm (
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #161:1>
there 's at least one in every carriage ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #162:1>
No-one will blame you for a genuine mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #163:1>
If you can , wait until the train pulls into a station before pulling the cord -
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #164:1>
help is more easily available at a station .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #165:1>
&arrowhead; Don't hesitate to alert the guard , conductor or any railway official if you feel threatened by a fellow passenger .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #166:1>
The staff will then keep a special eye open for you and alert the police if necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #167:1>
The British Transport Police
<ICE-GB:W2D-009 #168:1>

Registration
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #2:1>
What is a Registration Document ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #3:1>
A Registration Document shows the registered keeper ( person who keeps the vehicle on a public road , not necessarily the legal owner ) of the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #4:1>
It gives the keeper 's name and address , the registration mark and other information about the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #5:1>
A new Registration Document is issued each time there is a change in the details printed on it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #6:1>
How do I register a new vehicle ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #7:1>
If you buy a brand-new vehicle the dealer will usually arrange for it to be registered for you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #8:1>
Make sure that he enters your name and address including postcode ( which is very important ) correctly and clearly on the registration application form V55 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #9:1>
A mistake here can delay your receipt of the Registration Document , which is sent by post .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #10:1>
When you get it , check that all details shown are correct .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #11:1>
If there are any errors , send it back to DVLA explaining exactly what is wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #12:1>
If you want to take the vehicle abroad within 3 weeks of registration please ask the dealer to inform the VRO when he registers the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #13:1>
A certificate of registration will be issued to cover you while you are away .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #14:1>
What happens when I buy a used vehicle ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #15:1>
The Registration Document should be given to you when you buy the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #16:1>
Remember , this Document does not prove legal ownership .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #17:1>
Before buying a vehicle you should satisfy yourself that the seller either owns the vehicle , or is entitled to offer it for sale .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #18:1>
Ask to see a bill of sale in the seller 's name or other evidence such as a hire purchase discharge document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #19:1>
If you are buying privately , it is a good idea to view the vehicle at the address shown on the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #20:1>
If the vehicle is not registered in the seller 's name , or a Registration Document is not available , ask why .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #21:1>
If you are in any serious doubt about the ownership of the vehicle do not proceed with the purchase .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #22:1>
You must tell DVLA as soon as you buy a used vehicle -
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #23:1>
do not wait until you need to relicense it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #24:1>
Tell DVLA by completing the back of the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #25:1>
If you do not have a Registration Document you should apply for one using form V62 which you can get from any post office or VRO .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #26:1>
DVLA will then send you a new Registration Document in your name .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #27:1>
Unless the vehicle is registered in your name you will not be sent a renewal reminder form when the licence expires .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #28:1>
Also , it may not be possible to tell you if there is a possible safety related defect in the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #29:1>
How can I find out about previous keepers ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #30:1>
Details of the previous keeper should be given on the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #31:1>
If , as the registered keeper , you need information about any earlier keepers this can be provided .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #32:1>
Contact the Vehicle Enquiry Unit , DVLA , Swansea , SA99 1AN , quoting the registration mark of the vehicle you wish to check .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #33:1>
Can I find out who is the keeper of another vehicle ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #34:1>
You can obtain the name and address of the registered keeper of a vehicle where you can show reasonable cause for needing this information .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #35:1>
Apply with a fee of &pound-sign;3.50 the registration number , reason for enquiry and relevant dates to Fee-paying Enquiries , Vehicle Enquiry Unit , DVLA , Swansea , SA99 1BL .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #36:1>
Can I find out the computer data you hold about me ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #37:1>
The Data Protection Act gives you this right .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #38:1>
For more information make a personal enquiry with a fee of &pound-sign;1O to the Vehicle Enquiry Unit ( Data Protection Queries ) , DVLA , Swansea , SA99 1AN , quoting your full name and address and the registration mark you wish to check .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #39:1>
What if I change my name or address ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #40:1>
If you are the registered keeper of a vehicle and you change your address or name ( on marriage , for example ) you must tell DVLA , using the back of the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #41:1>
A new Document will be sent to you free of charge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #42:1>
What if I lose my Registration Document ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #43:1>
You should apply for a new one using form V62 ( available from any Post Office or VRO ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #44:1>
DVLA will send you a new Document after checking the application against the vehicle record .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #45:1>
If you later find the original , send it to DVLA with a letter saying what has happened .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #46:1>
Can registration marks be transferred ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #47:1>
Yes , in some circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #48:1>
The vehicle must be registered at DVLA and normally be licensed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #49:1>
Form V317 available from VROs , explains what to do , states the fee , and gives advice for those buying a vehicle for its number .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #50:1>
N.B.
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #51:1>
If a vehicle has been written off in an accident DO NOT dispose of the remains until such time as the transfer is finally approved and the registration document is received from DVLA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #52:1>
What about selling a vehicle ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #53:1>
As soon as you sell your vehicle , you should tell DVLA .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #54:1>
To do so complete the lower part of the Registration Document headed &ldquo; Notification of Sale or Transfer &rdquo; , detach it , and post it at once to DVLA , Swansea , SA99 1AR .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #55:1>
If you do not do this you may receive enquiries about the vehicle 's subsequent use .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #56:1>
You should keep a separate note of the buyer 's name and address .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #57:1>
Give the buyer the top part of the Registration Document and , if the vehicle is being sold privately , remind the buyer that DVLA must be informed at once that they have got the vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #58:1>
The Document shows the buyer how to do this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #59:1>
If you sell your vehicle through a motor auction , please ask whether the auctioneer will complete the notification of sale on your behalf .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #60:1>
If they will not , you should tell DVLA in writing that you have transferred the vehicle to the auction firm .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #61:1>
Use the notification of sale or transfer section of the registration document for this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #62:1>
What if my vehicle is stolen ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #63:1>
If your vehicle is stolen you should report it immediately to the police who will notify DVLA on your behalf .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #64:1>
You need not notify DVLA yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #65:1>
What if my vehicle is written off or scrapped ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #66:1>
If you dispose of a vehicle to an insurance company in return for a total loss payment then you should tell DVLA that you have passed on the vehicle to the insurance company , using the &ldquo; Notification of Sale or Transfer &rdquo; part of the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #67:1>
Give the top part of the Document to the insurance company .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #68:1>
You should only tell DVLA that a vehicle has been scrapped if you have actually broken it up or destroyed it yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #69:1>
Please notify this change on the back of the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #70:1>
If you have sold or passed the vehicle on to someone else for scrap ( even to a scrap dealer ) simply tell DVLA of the transfer using the tear-off part of the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #71:1>
Make sure you notify the change as soon as the vehicle changes hands .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #72:1>
Hand the top part of the Document to the new keeper of the vehicle so that the new keeper can tell DVLA when he has scrapped it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #73:1>
Licensing
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #74:1>
What is a vehicle licence ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #75:1>
A vehicle licence ( tax disc ) is a receipt which shows that you have paid the necessary vehicle excise duty for your vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #76:1>
It shows the registration mark and the date up to which duty has been paid , and it must be displayed on the left hand side of the vehicle 's windscreen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #77:1>
You cannot transfer a licence from one vehicle to another .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #78:1>
A licence cannot be issued in Great Britain where the application is supported by a Northern Ireland registration document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #79:1>
Licences may be bought for 6 or 12 calendar months , or , if the vehicle is being registered for the first time in Great Britain it is now also possible to license it for part of the month in which it is first registered , plus 6 or 12 months .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #80:1>
Full details of this option are contained in leaflet INF9 , available from Vehicle Registration Offices .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #81:1>
Two 6 month licences cost 10 per cent more than one 12 month licence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #82:1>
There is a 10% handling charge on the cost of a 6 month licence but this is not included in any refund .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #83:1>
Leaflet V149 available from licensing post offices and VROs contains the current rates of vehicle excise duty .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #84:1>
Vehicle Licence Stamps in units of &pound-sign;5 may be bought at any post office and used in payment or part payment for a vehicle licence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #85:1>
Can I drive or keep a vehicle on a road without a vehicle licence ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #86:1>
No , a vehicle driven , parked or even left unused on a public road must be licensed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #87:1>
If it is not you may be fined as well as having to pay an additional penalty which will include the arrears of duty owed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #88:1>
There are two separate offences : not displaying a current licence and using or keeping a vehicle on the public road without a current vehicle licence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #89:1>
There is one exception &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #90:1>
an unlicensed vehicle , provided it is insured , may be driven to and from a testing station for a pre<l->arranged compulsory test .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #91:1>
If your licence has just expired you may continue to use the vehicle for up to 14 days after its expiry .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #92:1>
But within that period you must have applied for a new one , to run from the day after the last one expired .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #93:1>
Please note that this 14 day period of grace is a concession .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #94:1>
In law a current licence must be displayed at all times , when the vehicle is on the road .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #95:1>
How do I license a vehicle ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #96:1>
When you buy a new vehicle the dealer will usually apply on your behalf for the first vehicle licence at the same time as applying for the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #97:1>
The vehicle should therefore be licensed when you take delivery .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #98:1>
If the dealer does not apply for you , make sure that the dealer gives you the application form ( V55 ) so that you can apply to a VRO yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #99:1>
In either case make sure that your name and address and other details on the form are stated clearly and correctly as these details will be used to set up the vehicle record and will appear on the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #100:1>
( To find your correct postal address and postcode , look for example on your TV licence . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #101:1>
When you buy a used vehicle the seller may agree to include a current licence in the sale .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #102:1>
If the seller does not you must use form V1O , or form V85 for goods vehicles weighing over 1525 kgs unladen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #103:1>
You can get these at post offices and VROs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #104:1>
To license the vehicle you will have to produce : the Registration Document ( with the changes section completed to show your name and address ) OR a completed form V62 available at any post office or VRO the duty payable ( leaflet V149 contains the current rates ) a valid certificate of insurance or cover note ( not the policy itself ) a test certificate &star; a plating certificate &star; a weight certificate &star; ( &star; if one is needed )
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #105:1>
If a cheque given as payment for a licence is dishonoured the licence will be void from the date of issue and the vehicle will be unlicensed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #106:1>
How do I renew a licence ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #107:1>
With a licence reminder
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #108:1>
About a fortnight before your vehicle licence expires , DVLA will send a reminder form B11 , or V85/1 in the case of some heavy goods vehicles , to the address shown on the Registration Document .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #109:1>
You should therefore ensure that DVLA has your current address ( see What if I change my name or address ? ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #110:1>
The reminder form may be used to relicense the vehicle provided that the date from which the licence is to run , the vehicle details and taxation class printed on the form are still correct .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #111:1>
You do not need to show your Registration Document when relicensing with a reminder form .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #112:1>
Without a licence reminder
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #113:1>
If you do not have the reminder form or if you have one and cannot use it , apply instead on form V1O , or for heavy goods vehicles , form V85 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #114:1>
You will have to produce your Registration Document or a completed form V62 , available at any post office .
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #115:1>
( see How do I license a vehicle ? )
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #116:1>
Do not send to DVLA
<ICE-GB:W2D-010 #117:1>
You do not need to present the old vehicle licence with your application .

Soil conditioners
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #2:1>
Soil conditioners are generally not regarded as sources of plant food ( though they con<l>tain some that is slowly released as they break down ) but as materials for increasing the organic content of soil , or as a mulch on its surface .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #3:1>
Peat is the most commonly used .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #4:1>
The best , and the one normally available , is moss ( rather than sedge ) peat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #5:1>
It is found in Ireland and the West of Scotland , also in the Pennines , on acidic rocks , where the acidic litter from heather and sphagnum moss builds up slowly in continuous wet and there<l>fore anaerobic ( airless ) conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #6:1>
The process is comparable with the &lsquo; tanning &rsquo; of leather :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #7:1>
instead of rotting away , it is chemi<l>cally altered and preserved .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #8:1>
It is a limited resource and is being used up far faster than it is being created .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #9:1>
Being fairly acidic , it can help neutralize alkaline soils , where it breaks down very quickly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #10:1>
It is also very useful for increasing the acidity of soils where rhododendrons and other acid lovers , such as heather , are grown .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #11:1>
Peat is a type of humus - soil scientists call it &lsquo; mor humus &rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo; mull humus &rsquo; - which is normally produced when vegetable matter decays .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #12:1>
The differences are striking .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #13:1>
Mull humus is much less acid , is full of plant nutrients and has a very fine structure so that it is sticky and will hold on to nutrients ( see Chapter 4 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #14:1>
Peat is low in plant nutrients , has a very loose structure and its capacity to hold water , and nutrients in solution , is like that of a sponge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #15:1>
Leaf mould is an excellent soil conditioner , but it cannot generally be bought ,
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #16:1>
it has to be made .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #17:1>
When leaves fall from decaying trees in autumn , most of the mobile ions , such as nitrogen ( N ) , phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) , have migrated back down to the roots to be stored over winter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #18:1>
What is left in an autumn leaf if is mostly cellulose , lig<l>nins and calcium - woody stuff .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #19:1>
Leaf mould is less acid than peat and contains slightly more potassium and nitrogen , but otherwise serves a similar purpose .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #20:1>
Making a leaf<l->mould heap is quite different from making compost -
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #21:1>
the heap does not heat up and the process takes a long time , at least a year .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #22:1>
Beech and oak leaves have the reputation of being the best , but there is no reason why other leaves should not be just as good .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #23:1>
If you have a large garden with a lot of trees you should gather your own supply ( remem<l>ber that you are depriving your woodland of its natural supply of humus ! ) , otherwise leaves have to be acquired from somewhere else , which is easier said than done .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #24:1>
But if leaves are available , you simply put them in a large bin made of posts driven into the ground , with wire-mesh in between , and tread them down a bit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #25:1>
Forest waste is another commercially available soil conditioner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #26:1>
It is a mixture of shredded bark and woodchips , and it must be fully composted if it is to be dug in , other<l>wise the process of decomposition will tem<l>porarily rob the soil of nitrogen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #27:1>
Generally , like leaf mould , it is applied as a mulch in a thick layer on the soil surface to suppress weeds and conserve moisture .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #28:1>
It will gradu<l>ally be incorporated into the soil by earth<l->worms and other soil creatures .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #29:1>
Potting composts
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #30:1>
As mentioned in the Introduction , there are two basic types of potting composts : soil<l->based and soil-less .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #31:1>
Soil-less composts - based on peat - now dominate the commer<l>cial and amateur market for two reasons at least .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #32:1>
First , peat is much lighter than soil so transport and handling are a lot cheaper and easier .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #33:1>
Second , the &lsquo; soil &rsquo; or &lsquo; loam &rsquo; ingredient of the John Innes type of compost is sup<l>posed to be derived from rotted turf , but there just is not enough spare turf around to be rotted for the expanding market , and the &lsquo; loam &rsquo; content √≠ content can be a bit iffy as a result .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #34:1>
John Innes composts come in several grades : cuttings , seed , No.1 , No.2 and No.3 - with varying proportions of sand , peat and loam , and increasing amounts of J.I. base fertilizer ( a balanced mixture of hoof and horn , superphosphate and potassium sul<l>phate with an overall analysis of 13-18-24 ) , ranging from none in &lsquo; cuttings &rsquo; and &lsquo; seed &rsquo; grades to a lot in No.3 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #35:1>
Manufacturers are not obliged to state the precise composition of composts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #36:1>
There are recommendations given by the Glasshouse Crops Research Institute for the composition of soil-less seed and potting composts simi<l>lar to those of the John Innes types , but without the loam , and with added lime and trace elements .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #37:1>
Most of the compost sold now is &lsquo; general purpose &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #38:1>
The idea behind graded composts is that cuttings and seed<l>lings not only do not need large supplies of fertilizers , but also cannot cope with them :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #39:1>
a strong solution around their newly develop<l>ing roots will upset their osmotic balance and stop them properly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #40:1>
So a multi<l->purpose compost must contain the same , or very little more nutrient than the old &lsquo; seed &rsquo; and &lsquo; cuttings &rsquo; composts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #41:1>
This simply means that they need additional fertilizer sooner if used for potting established plants .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #42:1>
The Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ( MAFF ) recently conducted tests , at the request of Fisons who make &lsquo; Levington &rsquo; composts , to compare various brands of general-purpose composts and also John Innes No.1 and No.2 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #43:1>
&lsquo; Levington &rsquo; came out on top , which is fair enough , but the John Innes types came out last on the list , which is not fair , because they are not supposed to be general-purpose composts , and are cer<l>tainly not designed for seed sowing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #44:1>
There are other potting composts created for the &lsquo; organic &rsquo; market that contain com<l>posted cow manures as an alternative to the loam in J.I. composts , and some with com<l>posted forest waste instead of peat , along with rock phosphate instead of super<l->phosphate and rock potash instead of potas<l>sium potassium sulphate .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #45:1>
As yet organic standards do not insist on this type of material for propagating plants , but no doubt they soon will .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #46:1>
Other composts
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #47:1>
Next we come to the other type of com<l>post .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #48:1>
Composting is a process that breaks down fresh organic matter into a brown , crumbly stuff that looks rather like nice soil .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #49:1>
It is an accelerated version of what happens naturally to plant residues .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #50:1>
The essence of the process is that it is aerobic - airy .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #51:1>
There are many books devoted to compost , and most gardening books have a lengthy men<l>tion of it - usually with a picture of a woo<l>den structure about one metre high and deep and two metres wide , divided into two com<l>partments : one for the heap that is being made , the other for maturing the heap that is finished .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #52:1>
It is a far from boring topic , but there are so many favourite ways of doing it that I shall not add my own .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #53:1>
You can even build your own compost container from bales of straw , though strict organic gardeners would have to be certain there were no pesticide residues in the straw .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #54:1>
The most important thing , whatever your design , is to make sure air can get in at the bottom :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #55:1>
putting wire mesh over a few bricks is a good idea .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #56:1>
The principle is this :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #57:1>
layers of garden or kitchen waste ( not meat , take-away leftovers or fat &semi; vegetable only or you will get a bad smell and/or rats ) are interspersed with layers of something rich in nitrogen : ammo<l>nium sulphate &semi; dried blood or animal manure , with or without layers of lime to counteract acidity .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #58:1>
Fungi and bacteria feed on these materials , and a supply of oxygen is necessary for them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #59:1>
Sometimes heaps are turned to aerate them , or poles stuck in to provide extra air holes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #60:1>
If all goes well , it gets very hot ( up to 70 &degree; C ) and the mixture begins to rot very quickly , and in the process weed seeds , pathogens and even perennial weed roots are killed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #61:1>
The compost can be used after the hot part of the fermentation when it will be still relatively coarse or it can be left to mature further .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #62:1>
Most people do not get ideal results from composting , but the end product is always worth having .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #63:1>
Unless you are certain the whole heap , including the outside , will heat up well ,
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #64:1>
it is best to leave out perennial weed roots .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #65:1>
Serious composters , with large gardens or some other source of raw material , can acquire a shredder which will make cabbage stumps and even woody material useable , and a &lsquo; tumbler &rsquo; - a large revolving drum which is turned every day - in which conditions are more easily con<l>trollable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #66:1>
Compost can be made on a small scale - if you do not have the space or quantity of material for a large heat-generating bin - using brandling worms ( Eisenia foetida ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #67:1>
They are similar to , but smaller than , the ordinary earthworm , and if you have a com<l>post or manure heap , there will almost cer<l>tainly be some in it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #68:1>
Otherwise you can get them mail order from organic suppliers or from fishing suppliers - brandling worms are also used as bait .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #69:1>
The principle is simple :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #70:1>
you feed the worms with kitchen waste and they turn it into compost .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #71:1>
In practice it is more compli<l>cated because the worms are a bit fussy about their conditions : it must be warm and not too acid .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #72:1>
A plastic dustbin with a lid is the basic requirement .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #73:1>
Drainage holes are bored into the bottom six inches &semi; above this a woo<l>den board , also with drainage holes &semi; a layer of sedge peat ( not as acid as moss peat ) or even shredded damp newspaper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #74:1>
The worms are placed on this , and then layers of vegeta<l>ble waste - even some fat and meat - alter<l>nating with peat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #75:1>
Once it is full , it is turned occasionally with a fork , until the worms have digested it all &semi; the compost is then removed and as many worms as possible put back , and the process started again .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #76:1>
The worms will not be active in the winter , but as long as they do not freeze , they will survive .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #77:1>
Animal manures
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #78:1>
These manures depend on the animal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #79:1>
Cow manure , or farmyard manure ( FYM ) , horse and pig , are the most commonly used .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #80:1>
The composition naturally varies considerably , not just the proportions of nutrients and water , but most importantly , the amount of straw .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #81:1>
As with garden compost the nitro<l>genous elements and the plant residues rot together to make a nice end product - a good soil conditioner and source of nutrients .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #82:1>
In the days of &lsquo; mixed &rsquo; farms where cereals were grown as well as cattle raised , farm<l>yard manure was plentiful and useful .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #83:1>
Cereal and cattle production is often separate now , so farmers end up with a problem of waste disposal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #84:1>
Cow slurry becomes an environ<l>mental pollutant instead of a useful fertilizer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #85:1>
If farmyard manure is to be dug in , it is best left to rot for a year even if some nutrients are lost in the process .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #86:1>
Raw manure will adversely affect plants in a number of ways :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #87:1>
first , there will be a lot of free nitro<l>gen which may &lsquo; burn &rsquo; the roots of seedlings , and cause carrots or parsnips to &lsquo; fork &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #88:1>
When this has either been used up , washed out or volatilized into the air , there will be a lot of unrotted straw left :
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #89:1>
the soil organisms will steal what nitrogen is left to rot down that straw , leaving the growing plats with a tem<l>porary deficiency , which will have to be cor<l>rected by adding some extra fertilizer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #90:1>
This is particularly important with horse or chicken manure , which is generally mixed with wood chippings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #91:1>
These break down even more slowly than straw and can deplete soil nitrogen for even longer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #92:1>
A further rea<l>son for rotting manure thoroughly is that any pesticide residues are also degraded .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #93:1>
Persis<l>tent chemicals often found in straw include lindane , benomyl and 2 , 3 , 6-TBA - which is similar to 2 , 4-D , but more durable and could conceivably damage garden plants the following season .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #94:1>
Finally , there are the concentrated &lsquo; organic &rsquo; manures .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #95:1>
There are several of these on the market - the worst are wood chip and battery poultry manure , dried and bagged and sold as &lsquo; six times richer than farm yard manure &rsquo; &semi; the best are simply con<l>centrated composted cow manure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #96:1>
Since they are concentrated , they are best treated as a fertilizer - spread at so many ounces per square yard , rather than in shovelfuls .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #97:1>
They are also expensive - about &pound-sign;8 per bag com<l>pared with , say , &pound-sign;30 for a trailer load of unconcentrated manure , so they are not a substitute if you have anything more than a tiny garden .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #98:1>
A further disadvantage is that being &lsquo; live &rsquo; substances sealed in a plastic bag they can actually go &lsquo; off &rsquo; &semi; anaerobic bacteria can get established and produce toxins which could harm your plants , so it is best not to store them too long .
<ICE-GB:W2D-011 #99:1>
Various types of manure and fertilizers are mentioned in the A to Z , and some brands of compost are mentioned in the table of &lsquo; organic &rsquo; products .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #1:1>
WATER , GAS AND HEATING SERVICES
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #2:1>
Water Mains
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #3:1>
Apart from the small number of houses in rural areas where water is obtained from a suitable private source like a spring , mountain stream or well , most water is provided through pipes which are called &lsquo; mains &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #4:1>
The pressure of water in the mains is based on the fire-fighting require<l>ments of a locality .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #5:1>
This pressure is maintained by means of water towers and gravity , or by booster pumping stations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #6:1>
The mains are buried about one metre below ground level so they do not freeze up , and outside each house they are tapped by a connecting pipe fitted with a stop-cock .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #7:1>
From there on , within the boundary of the property , it becomes the owner 's responsibility .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #8:1>
This cold water supply pipe is usually l5mm ( 1/2in ) in diameter ( internal dimension ) and enters the house below ground level to a further stop-cock inside the house , often near the kitchen sink .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #9:1>
It then becomes the &lsquo; rising main &rsquo; to a storage tank in the roof space .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #10:1>
Some water boards insist that all cold water taps in the house are taken from the rising main &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #11:1>
others insist that only the kitchen tap is taken from the main and that all others are fed from the roof tank .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #12:1>
This is an obnoxious requirement designed to suit the water board 's storage calculations and not the consumer 's wishes &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #13:1>
you can determine which system is installed by turning on each tap in turn and putting your thumb over the outlet .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #14:1>
If you can stop the flow fairly easily it is the latter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #15:1>
If you can't , then you have mains pressure from the rising main .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #16:1>
Mains pipes should be made of plastic or copper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #17:1>
If they are lead or iron they are old and will have to be replaced before long .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #18:1>
If the water is hard the pipes will almost certainly be reduced in internal diameter by scale and the pressure will be reduced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #19:1>
Test the kitchen cold tap fully opened to see what the flow and pressure is like .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #20:1>
It should be vigorous , not sluggish .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #21:1>
According to the water authorities , most water from the mains is safe to drink , but in fact some 2.5 million people in this country are drinking sub-standard water .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #22:1>
The two main causes are lead and nitrates which can bring about debility , heart weakness and cancer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #23:1>
The soft and acid water areas of Scotland and north-west England are most at risk from lead , and the East Anglian and Staffordshire areas from nitrates .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #24:1>
Tap water also contains varying amounts of rust , grit and silt .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #25:1>
There are many different water filters and softeners on the market , but you should take nothing for granted , so consult the local water authority before using any of these devices .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #26:1>
And remember , in accordance with the Public Health Act 1936 , amended in 1961 , it is the duty of every water authority to ensure that all supplies are clean , clear , unodorous , wholesome and palatable !
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #27:1>
The water boards are always prepared to discuss pressure and purity , but whether they will do anything about it is another matter , and the effects of privatisation have yet to be seen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #28:1>
Storage Tanks
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #29:1>
The water cistern will be in the roof space or in a high cupboard and should be of an approved plastic construction , clean , strong and with the seal of approval of the National Water Council.
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #30:1>
It should have a readily removable cover which fits closely without being airtight , and should be protected against frost by insulating material .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #31:1>
The inlet pipe , or rising main , enters at the top of the tank to a ball<l->valve .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #32:1>
The outlet should be 100mm ( 4in ) from the bottom of the tank , to be free of sediment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #33:1>
A 20mm ( 3/4in ) overflow pipe from near the top of the tank should take water by gravity ( with a fall of 1 in 10 minimum ) to 150mm ( 6in ) or so beyond the outer walls of the house where its discharge will be safe and visible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #34:1>
The overflow should be some 50mm ( 2in ) above the cistern water level .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #35:1>
For the average property , the cistern should have a capacity of 230 litres ( 50 gallons ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #36:1>
Gas
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #37:1>
Natural gas contains up to 95 per cent methane , a gas with a high calorific value which requires ten times its own volume of air for complete combustion .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #38:1>
It is therefore essential that any room where gas is used must be adequately supplied with air , and must have an adequate flue to discharge the burnt gases , which are toxic .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #39:1>
The service pipe from the Gas Board mains to the property must be laid by the Gas Board or by their nominee .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #40:1>
This pipe is usually a 25mm ( 1in ) diameter steel pipe , wrapped with special tape to protect it from rusting , and buried to protect it from frost .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #41:1>
It should be laid to a fall with a drain cock to release condensation in the pipe .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #42:1>
The pipe must not pass through the foundations and should enter the external wall of the house through a sleeve which permits movement , and then lead to a meter which controls the volume and pressure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #43:1>
The meter and service pipe should not touch or be close to any electrical conduit or apparatus .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #44:1>
Installation pipes from the meter should be of steel or copper and should be surface-mounted and away from electrical services and appliances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #45:1>
All pipes should be bracketed to avoid accidental damage .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #46:1>
Gas leakages can be detected by smell or by instruments .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #47:1>
Any evidence of leakage should be dealt with immediately by turning off the supply at the meter stop-cock and calling the Gas Board .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #48:1>
Only the Gas Board or a CORGI ( Con<l>federation for the Registration of Gas Installers ) registered contractor may carry out any work at all on gas service pipes or equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #49:1>
Heating
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #50:1>
Remember this -
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #51:1>
official figures show that two million houses in England alone are inadequately heated .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #52:1>
So in carrying out your survey , try to find the answers to the following questions :
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #53:1>
What kind of heating is installed ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #54:1>
Does it operate efficiently and keep the house warm in winter ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #55:1>
How old is it and what condition is it in ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #56:1>
Is it safe ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #57:1>
What controls are there , and do they work ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #58:1>
Can you afford the running costs and maintenance costs ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #59:1>
When was it last serviced , by whom , and what service agreements or guarantees exist ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #60:1>
Is it what you want anyway ?
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #61:1>
If there is an open fire , you must have a coal bunker of reasonable size at hand , and there must be a coal merchant willing to deliver good quality coal , or smokeless fuel if it is a smokeless zone .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #62:1>
Check !
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #63:1>
There must be a clean and efficient way of disposing of the ash .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #64:1>
There must be adequate venti<l>lation into the room , and the flue must be in good condition and have a good draught , with no susceptibility to down<l>draught .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #65:1>
You can try burning paper and wood in the grate , and from its appearance you can usually tell whether the fireplace is in general use or not .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #66:1>
Ask when the chimney was last swept and by whom .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #67:1>
If gas fires are fitted into chimney flues , and if the Gas Board has serviced the appliances recently , you can be reasonably satisfied that the installations are safe .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #68:1>
Other<l>wise beware of ill-fitted appliances , blocked flues and badly maintained heaters -
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #69:1>
all can cause lethal fumes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #70:1>
And remember , flues should not be interconnected with any other room .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #71:1>
Once again , good ventilation into the room is essential .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #72:1>
Central heating boilers should only be fitted to a flue that has been lined with a stainless steel flexible liner of about 150mm ( 6in ) diameter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #73:1>
Boiler size depends upon the sum of all the room requirements plus an allowance for domestic hot water , plus a little to spare .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #74:1>
Both free-standing and wall-mounted gas boilers come in conventional chimney flue versions , or in a balanced flue version , where a combined terminal on an outside wall provides a fresh air inlet and an exhaust gas outlet .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #75:1>
Even if appliances appear to be in good order , allow for the cost of immediate testing and servicing by the Gas Board , CORGI registered contractor or , in the case of oil , the oil company 's nominee , as soon as you move in .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #76:1>
If electric night storage heaters are installed , check that they are included in the sale , as well as any electric or gas fires .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #77:1>
Do not assume that storage heaters can operate satisfactorily without supplementation by fires or radiators of one sort or another -
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #78:1>
there is no substitute for instant heat when and where you want it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #79:1>
Check that the wiring is new and in good condition , and immediately on occupation ask the Electricity Board to safety-check the whole instal<l>lation - appliances and wiring .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #80:1>
Allow for this check in your costs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #81:1>
There is no ideal system of central heating , and life would be so much simpler if there were .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #82:1>
But each of us is different , and our needs vary according to the time of day and what we are doing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #83:1>
In a house , however , all calculations are based on assumptions of &lsquo; heat loss &rsquo; through walls , windows , roof , floors , and through draught and venti<l>lation .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #84:1>
This heat loss depends also on the temperature outside ( the lower it is , the more heat you lose ) and the temperature you require inside ( the higher it is , the more you lose ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #85:1>
It also depends on the sun -
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #86:1>
a south-facing window will add more heat than it loses , winter or summer , though not always when you want it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #87:1>
Central heating systems circulate either hot water or warm air throughout the house , and can also provide domestic hot water .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #88:1>
In a warm-air system , air is heated by gas , electricity , oil or solid fuel and is then circulated through large ducts to all parts of the house .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #89:1>
The domestic hot water is usually provided from a separate boiler or electric immersion heater fitted to the hot water cylinder .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #90:1>
In a hot water radiator system , water is heated by a gas , oil or solid fuel boiler and circulated through pipes and radiators .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #91:1>
Domestic hot water may be supplied in two ways , &lsquo; directly &rsquo; or &lsquo; indirectly &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #92:1>
A direct system has only one water circuit which supplies both the taps and the radiators .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #93:1>
Each time hot water is drawn from the taps the whole system has to be topped up with cold water from the storage tank .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #94:1>
This frequent introduction of new water is a major disadvantage , as scaling occurs when water is heated to 71 &degree; C ( 160 &degree; F ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #95:1>
Because of this , the system is rarely used now , but it does still exist in some older houses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #96:1>
The more normal &lsquo; indirect &rsquo; system has two water circuits : a primary circuit which is heated in the boiler and then circulates to a heat-exchange unit inside the hot water cylinder before returning to the boiler to be reheated &semi; and a second circuit which runs from the boiler to the radiators .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #97:1>
The two circuits are self-contained and lose no water other than by leaks and evaporation , so no scaling occurs after the initial heating of the water .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #98:1>
The hot water cylinder supplies the domestic hot water to the taps .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #99:1>
When hot water is drawn from the taps , new cold water is fed into the cylinder from the cold storage tank above .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #100:1>
A small &lsquo; balance &rsquo; tank is provided in the roof space for topping up the evaporation losses in the radiator circuits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #101:1>
This is fitted with a ball valve inlet , an outlet , an overflow , and , hooked over it , an expansion pipe .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #102:1>
One r&ocircumflex;le of this pipe is to provide an unobstructed path for water in the cylinder to expand as it is heated .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #103:1>
It follows that it also ensures that there is no possibility of the cylinder exploding due to pressure or overheating .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #104:1>
Its main function , however , is to ensure that the system rids itself of unwanted air .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #105:1>
Occasionally air becomes trapped in radiators and cannot escape to reach expansion/vent pipe .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #106:1>
That is why each radiator is fitted with a &lsquo; bleed &rsquo; valve which can be opened with a small key - an essential tool in every house with central heating radiators .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #107:1>
You can identify a &lsquo; direct &rsquo; system by examining the boiler .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #108:1>
If there are only two pipes leading to/from the boiler , it is direct .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #109:1>
&lsquo; Indirect &rsquo; has four pipes , though sometimes it has only three , when the balance tank in the roof is combined with the storage tank , or when an ancient &lsquo; primatic &rsquo; cylinder has been fitted .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #110:1>
The best systems have four pipes plus a balance tank and hot water cylinder .
<ICE-GB:W2D-012 #111:1>
Anything less is out of date and needs changing .

<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #1:1>
THE RETURN OF SERVE
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #2:1>
If the service is the most important shot in the game , then the return of service is the second most important .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #3:1>
The main aim of the return of service is to get the ball back over the net and into play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #4:1>
Don't worry about trying to hit the cover off the ball :
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #5:1>
chip it , chop it , block it -
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #6:1>
but whatever you do , force your opponent to hit another ball after the serve .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #7:1>
Once the return is in play , you increase your chance of winning the point .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #8:1>
Position yourself properly for the return of service .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #9:1>
If your oppo<l>nent has a weak service , move forwards .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #10:1>
If the server has power<l>ful service , stand further back and just block the return .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #11:1>
Try to pick up the ball early .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #12:1>
This is done by watching the ball carefully .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #13:1>
Try to find clues as to where your opponent is going to serve by watching the server and the ball during the service action .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #14:1>
As a beginner , the most important point is to be alert on your toes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #15:1>
As the server tosses the ball in the air , get ready to move .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #16:1>
Check when the server strikes the ball , and then move forwards to hit the return .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #17:1>
SERVICE POSITIONS
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #18:1>
The server has the choice of where to posi<l>tion the ball in the service box :
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #19:1>
1 ) either serve hard and flat down the centre line ( A ) &semi; 2 ) or to a position ( B ) straight at the oppo<l>nent , or sliced into the 's body &semi; 3 ) or to position ( C ) , i.e. sliced out wide ( for a right-hander ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #20:1>
POSITION OF RECEIVER
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #21:1>
The receiver has to concentrate very hard when receiving serve , and needs to stand in the middle of the serving angle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #22:1>
The server can hit the ball anywhere between the two lines X and Y .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #23:1>
A server B receiver
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #24:1>
MOVE EARLY FOR A WIDE BALL
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #25:1>
One of the hardest serves for the beginner to return is the wide sliced serve or the high-kicking topspin serve .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #26:1>
The key to returning these difficult serves is to move forwards and take the ball early .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #27:1>
If you move into the ball , you should be able to take it before it has bounced high ( topspin ) or before it has cut away ( slice ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #28:1>
When returning the wide serve , try to follow the path of the arrows , as shown here in the diagram .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #29:1>
A server
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #30:1>
GOOD RETURN OF SERVE
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #31:1>
Jimmy Connors in his hey<l>day was renowned for the quality of his returns of service .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #32:1>
He had the ability to pick the ball up early , and invariably attacked the return .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #33:1>
Notice how even when slightly off the ground Connors is leaning into the shot to attack this backhand return .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #34:1>
STAR TIP
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #35:1>
A good server can hit the ball in many different ways .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #36:1>
The receiver must be flexible and capable of hit<l>ting the ball from many different positions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #37:1>
THE FOREHAND VOLLEY
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #38:1>
A volley is any shot which is played before the ball bounces .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #39:1>
It is generally played from near to the net .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #40:1>
Technically , the volley is the simplest shot to teach .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #41:1>
If you are a beginner , the easiest grip to use is the basic eastern forehand grip &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #42:1>
however , as you progress it is preferable to use the chopper or continental grip because you can use this for both the forehand and backhand volleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #43:1>
When you are at the net , it is quite common to have to face a succession of forehand and backhand volleys , and it is far more convenient to use one grip for all your volley shots .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #44:1>
Net play often involves split-second timing , allowing little opportunity to change the grip .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #45:1>
Once you have mastered the basics , you will find that the chopper or continental grip is the best to use .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #46:1>
STEP 1
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #47:1>
Start from the ready position , approxi<l>mately 6-8ft ( 1.82-2.44m ) from the net .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #48:1>
( Hint :
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #49:1>
touch the net with your racket and then move back two paces . )
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #50:1>
You are now much nearer to your opponent , so be alert in a springy position , and ready to move .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #51:1>
Hold the racket out in front of you , sup<l>ported at the throat by your free hand .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #52:1>
Watch your opponent and the ball careful<l>ly -
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #53:1>
this will help you to decide which side the ball is coming .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #54:1>
As soon as your oppo<l>nent strikes the ball , check .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #55:1>
This enables you to get your weight evenly distributed , and to push off to whichever side the ball comes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #56:1>
STEP 2
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #57:1>
Prepare early with a short takeback , and then contact the ball well out in front of you , at a comfortable distance from your body .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #58:1>
Your arm will be slightly bent .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #59:1>
The action is a PUNCHING or BLOCKING one .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #60:1>
Let the racket do the work with very little follow-through .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #61:1>
In order to get some power into the volley as you move forwards to the ball , transfer your weight onto your front foot &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #62:1>
step into the shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #63:1>
STEP 3
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #64:1>
Try to keep the follow-through short so that you will have time to get ready for the next shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #65:1>
The volleyer should have a very firm wrist on contact .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #66:1>
Notice how balanced the volleyer is .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #67:1>
POSITIONING
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #68:1>
Mats Wilander is seen here moving forwards to hit his forehand volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #69:1>
His eyes are focused on the ball , the racket head is up and he is transferring his weight onto his front foot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #70:1>
The wrist is very firm .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #71:1>
Wilander is going to hit this volley well out in front of his body -
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #72:1>
excellent positioning .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #73:1>
STAR TIP
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #74:1>
Hold the racket well out in front of you and always try to meet the ball early .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #75:1>
Power and control are obtained from weight transfer and timing , not by swinging the racket head -
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #76:1>
always PUNCH or BLOCK the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #77:1>
THE BACKHAND VOLLEY
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #78:1>
The backhand volley can be played either with one hand or with two hands .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #79:1>
First , let us take a closer look at the one-handed backhand volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #80:1>
You should start from the ready position with the chopper ( or backhand ) grip mentioned previously .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #81:1>
The racket takeback is very short ( like the forehand volley ) , but this time the supporting free hand only comes off the racket just before the ball makes contact with the racket strings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #82:1>
The racket is brought forwards in a PUNCHING or BLOCKING action .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #83:1>
The ball is contacted well out in front of the body , at a com<l>fortable distance to the side .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #84:1>
Again , power is obtained by transfer<l>ring the weight forwards , so try to step into the shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #85:1>
Remember to keep the follow-through short for a solid volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #86:1>
The two-handed backhand volley has the same action as that of the one-hander , although generally the takeback is slightly longer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #87:1>
Be careful not to swing at the volley if you use two hands .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #88:1>
The hands must be close together on the grip .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #89:1>
Beginners may get more strength on the backhand volley with two hands .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #90:1>
STEP 1
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #91:1>
The ready position -
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #92:1>
use either a chopper or backhand grip .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #93:1>
As for all shots , you need to be alert and on your toes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #94:1>
This is especially important if playing close to the net - particularly in doubles .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #95:1>
STEP 2
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #96:1>
Here the racket is supported with the free hand as it is taken back .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #97:1>
Note the short takeback .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #98:1>
This is an advantage if you are close to the net and have little time to prepare for your shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #99:1>
STEP 3
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #100:1>
The action is then a short punch or block with little follow-through .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #101:1>
Note how the weight is going forwards to get power into the shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #102:1>
The grip must be firm on impact , and good balance must be maintained throughout the stroke .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #103:1>
After hitting the ball , recover quickly to the ready position for the next shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #104:1>
The three steps show the one-handed backhand volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #105:1>
Although you can use a two-handed volley , the major disadvan<l>tage is one of reach .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #106:1>
This means you need to be quicker on your feet and you also need to use a slightly longer backswing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #107:1>
It is advisable to play one-handed volleys whenever possible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #108:1>
CONTROL
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #109:1>
When Stefan Edberg won the men 's title at Wimble<l>don in 1988 , he proved that one of his most suc<l>cessful shots was his back-hand volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #110:1>
Edberg shows perfect control as he steps forward to this backhand volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #111:1>
The racket is sup<l>ported with his left hand at the throat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #112:1>
His arm is straight , the wrist firm .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #113:1>
He has good weight trans<l>ference to get power into the volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #114:1>
Notice the con<l>centration on his face as he strikes the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #115:1>
If you hit volleys like this , you will have a lot of success !
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #116:1>
STAR TIP
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #117:1>
When volleying one-handed , always use your free hand to support the racket .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #118:1>
Keep volleying well out in front of your body .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #119:1>
Be positive and go to meet the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #120:1>
Remember : volleying is fun .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #121:1>
VOLLEY VARIATIONS ( 1 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #122:1>
In addition to the basic volley , you may have to play half-volleys , high volleys and low volleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #123:1>
You might be forced to play the half-volley when you are coming into the net , but haven't moved quite quickly enough .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #124:1>
The ball is played just after the bounce , at about ground level .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #125:1>
It is a shot you might play instinctively , but really it is a defensive shot , played when you are out of position .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #126:1>
It needs good footwork and balance if it is to be executed properly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #127:1>
To play this shot you need to get down to the ball , so bend your knees and take a short back<l->swing to come forwards with a low-to-high action .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #128:1>
Follow through in the direction you want the ball to go .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #129:1>
The racket face is slightly open on impact , and the grip and the wrist are firm .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #130:1>
The high volley may look easy to hit , but all too often a player swings at the ball , with the result that the ball ends up over the baseline .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #131:1>
The key is to watch the ball very carefully , set yourself up to play the volley with a high racket takeback , and then exag<l>gerate the high-to-low volleying action , while playing the ball well out in front of the body .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #132:1>
The low volley is often one of the most difficult volleys to play , as the ball is coming low over the net and you are forced to hit it upwards to get it back over the net .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #133:1>
It is played generally when you are a long way from the net and your opponent has hit a good return at your feet .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #134:1>
There are four basic points to remember when hitting a low volley : bend your knees , not your back &semi; open the racket face so that it is tilted back slightly &semi; keep the racket head up &semi; and play the ball out in front of you .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #135:1>
THE HIGH BACKHAND VOLLEY
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #136:1>
The racket is taken back above shoulder height .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #137:1>
The action is a high-to-low one &semi; the follow-through is short .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #138:1>
THE LOW BACKHAND VOLLEY
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #139:1>
Notice the low position of the player .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #140:1>
The racket head is up and the racket face slightly open .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #141:1>
The ball is struck well out in front of the body and the follow-through is then slightly upwards , to help lift the ball over the net and deep into the opponent 's court .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #142:1>
If necessary , sacrifice some pace to get a good length .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #143:1>
TECHNICAL POINTS
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #144:1>
This photograph high<l>lights the main technical points on the low volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #145:1>
Tim Mayotte , who has a strong serve-and-volley game , gets down low to the volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #146:1>
His knees are bent , the racket face is slightly open , and the racket head is up .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #147:1>
Tim is about to con<l>tact the ball out in front of the body .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #148:1>
The low volley is hard to play , but Tim makes it look easy .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #149:1>
STAR TIP
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #150:1>
Try to get into the net quickly so you don't have to play half-volleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #151:1>
VOLLEY VARIATIONS ( 2 )
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #152:1>
The other variations on the volley include the drop volley , the drive volley and the lob volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #153:1>
The drop volley is similar to the drop shot , except that it is played before the ball bounces .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #154:1>
Generally it is played when the ball is at , or below , net height .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #155:1>
This shot requires a great deal of touch and feel for the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #156:1>
You need a short backswing and reduced follow-through for this shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #157:1>
Make sure your wrist is firm on impact , and that the racket face is open to help impart more backspin on to the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #158:1>
Try to keep your eye on the ball , your head over the ball , and bend your knees .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #159:1>
The drive volley is sometimes used as an approach shot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #160:1>
It is hit from the mid-court area and , as its name suggests , it is a combina<l>tion of a drive and volley , with the characteristics of both .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #161:1>
Use a longer backswing than for a normal volley .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #162:1>
In order to control the shot , it is advisable to hit the ball with a little topspin .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #163:1>
The lob volley is more common in doubles than in singles .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #164:1>
It is particularly effective when all four players are at the net and it is used as a surprise , forcing the opposing pair to retreat to the baseline .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #165:1>
It is similar to the basic lob ( see pages 38-39 ) , but is played before the ball bounces .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #166:1>
This shot requires a fine touch .
<ICE-GB:W2D-013 #167:1>
If played badly , it can have drastic consequences , particularly if it gives your opponent an easy smash !
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #1:1>
GETTING THE BEST PICTURE
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #2:1>
Assuming that you have found the receiver that suits your present and future needs ( including the variety of ways in which it can fit into the rest of your audio-visual system ) , the next stage is to install it so that it will give the best results that it can deliver .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #3:1>
You should begin with the most fundamental and most frequently overlooked item - the aerial or antenna .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #4:1>
Reception
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #5:1>
With regular television ( cable and satellite have different problems ) , recepetion quality can vary from country to country , and even from house to house in the same street .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #6:1>
One large building can reflect visual echoes ( known as &ldquo; ghosting &rdquo; ) &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #7:1>
other forms of interference can create &ldquo; snow &rdquo; in darker areas of the image .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #8:1>
The list of possible causes for poor reception is virtually endless , but the remedies are simple .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #9:1>
Employ a properly qualified installer to put a large antenna on the roof ( not in the attic , unless you live next to the transmitter ) , and make sure that the incoming signal is free of extraneous visual or sonic noise .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #10:1>
If you live in a remote valley or a complex of high-rise buildings you may need some form of booster near the antenna .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #11:1>
Do not even consider an indoor antenna -
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #12:1>
they are a simple way of throwing money down the drain .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #13:1>
There is no point in wasting expensive television equip<l>ment on an unsatisfactory signal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #14:1>
European televisions use 75 ohm co-axial cable as an input for UHF broadcasts , whereas in the USA and some other countries VHF broadcasts are received via 300 ohm unbalanced inputs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #15:1>
UHF is much more refined than VHF though more directional , and is therefore more suited to Europe , where there is a rather restricted number of transmitters in operation .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #16:1>
The incoming signal , whether VHF or UHF , interacts with the dipoles on the antenna to produce a very small electric current .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #17:1>
This is amplified and decoded by the television set .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #18:1>
The dimensions of the antenna are directly related to the wavelength of the signal you intend to receive and the elements of the antenna are set at right<l->angles to the transmitter , and may be aligned vertically or , more commonly , horizontally , to match the polarity of the transmitted signal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #19:1>
In poor reception areas it is worth trying an antenna with more elements , especially for UHF wavelengths .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #20:1>
This will increase its directionality and give a better signal - so long as the antenna is aligned correctly with the transmitter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #21:1>
If the distance from the antenna to the receiver is long , another way of improving the signal is to use a &ldquo; low-loss &rdquo; cable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #22:1>
This will minimise the inevit<l>able weakening of the signal that occurs in the cable and depletes the image quality .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #23:1>
The conductor in low-loss cable is simply thicker than that in standard cable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #24:1>
The UHF signal that feeds into the co-axial 75 ohm cable in Europe should not have too long a run .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #25:1>
If you live in the basement of a tall building and a long run is unavoid<l>able , you may need to have a booster ( effectively a pre<l->amplifier ) in the roof , to help the signal down .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #26:1>
The same problems do not apply so urgently to 300 ohm flat-feed cables for VHF .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #27:1>
But in the USA , where there are transmitters all over the place , aligning the antenna is more of a problem .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #28:1>
An electrically movable antenna is the answer .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #29:1>
There can be a similar problem with satellite dishes , where several &ldquo; footprints &rdquo; may overlap a particular geographical area .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #30:1>
In Europe , different satellite broadcasters often use different systems .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #31:1>
You may therefore need more than one dish to receive all the stations .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #32:1>
Power supply
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #33:1>
You can view a video picture on either a TV receiver or a monitor .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #34:1>
TV receivers , which we normally use in the home , can decode the radio-frequency input before it is converted into red , green , blue , luminance , and audio signals .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #35:1>
Monitors have no sound supply or frequency tuner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #36:1>
They are used simply to look at the video signal from a camera or VCR .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #37:1>
While ordinary home receivers run off the main power supply at 240 V or 110 V , video monitors can run off this supply or , in some cases , off DC via a 12 V converter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #38:1>
So-called receiver-monitors have the best of both worlds .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #39:1>
They can either take the radio frequency signal ( RF ) and decode it , or accept direct uncoded RGB and audio input , with greatly superior quality .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #40:1>
They also have many extra input and output jack sockets , for excellent reasons .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #41:1>
Tuning in
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #42:1>
The RF signal from the antenna is first of all routed through the VCR tuner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #43:1>
Each channel on the VCR is tuned to a broadcast channel .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #44:1>
But the entire RF input is passed immediately on to the television via its RF input jack socket
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #45:1>
On the TV the RF input from the video has to be assigned its own channel , so that you can view the VCR output on the television screen .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #46:1>
The TV will thus be able to receive channels from the &ldquo; air &rdquo; or from the recorder .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #47:1>
You therefore need to do three tuning jobs , tuning the VCR and television to the separate channels , and tuning the VCR to the channel you have assigned it on the television .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #48:1>
These jobs vary according to the models and should be fully explained in the manuals that come with the equipment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #49:1>
The key-pad
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #50:1>
The push-button remote-control unit or key-pad has virtually taken over the functions of the buttons of the television and VCR , although these controls will still be found , usually behind a flimsy lid on the front of the television .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #51:1>
The functions that can be controlled from the keypad naturally include brightness , contrast , channel selection , volume , and all the other everyday items .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #52:1>
But increasingly , a range of other facilities is available , from alarm functions to digital picture-in-picture special effects .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #53:1>
Many of these are of limited use , but it is essential to understand the basic key functions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #54:1>
Video set-up
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #55:1>
When first using your television , only three video controls need concern you : color saturation , contrast , and brightness .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #56:1>
The latter two controls are sometimes confused -
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #57:1>
the brightness control is usually marked with a sun symbol , while contrast generally has a half-moon design .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #58:1>
Cheaper televisions sometimes have no bright<l>ness control .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #59:1>
Some sets , particularly in the USA , also have a control for hue , which influences color balance and is useful where reception ( as in America ) is erratic .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #60:1>
To begin with , turn down the color control until you have a black-and-white image &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #61:1>
then manipulate the brightness and contrast controls until you are happy with the combination .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #62:1>
When you are satisfied with the tonality and black-and-white range of your mono<l>chrome image , gradually turn up the color until it looks natural in the lighting conditions in which you would normally be viewing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #63:1>
Try to light the room from behind the set -
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #64:1>
even modem sets are easily outshone by the light of the sun .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #65:1>
VIDEO TAPE
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #66:1>
Tape is the recording medium used by both audio and video recorders .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #67:1>
It is a very thin material ( traditionally polyester ) , which is coated on one side with a layer of oxide that can be magnetized by the recording heads in the camcorder or VCR .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #68:1>
The oxide is most commonly iron , but some tapes use chromium dioxide or cobalt<l->doped metal
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #69:1>
&semi; there are also metal-evaporated tapes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #70:1>
These last types are designed to give considerably better frequency response , with a consequent improvement in picture quality and recording density .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #71:1>
The oxide is covered by a highly polished topcoat that protects the recording heads and the magnetic oxide &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #72:1>
this also improves head contact .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #73:1>
There is also often a carbon backing to reduce static as the tape passes across the head guides .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #74:1>
The amount of recorded information that can be packed on to the tape depends on two main factors : the speed of the tape as it moves across the record and replay heads &semi; and the width of the tape-head gap .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #75:1>
The faster the effective &ldquo; writing speed &rdquo; of the tape , and the narrower the gap , the more information can be absorbed for subsequent replay .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #76:1>
In practice , the effective writing speed works out at about 6 meters per second for domestic video machines , more on professional models .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #77:1>
It is impractical to actually have the tape playing at this sort of speed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #78:1>
Consequently , all the early types of video recording , and most of the later ones , have attempted to achieve a high writing speed without an excessive actual tape speed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #79:1>
This has meant that the tape heads themselves must move in relation to the tape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #80:1>
True video recording really began with the invention by Ampex of the Quadruplex ( Quad ) recorder in 1956 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #81:1>
This used a 2-inch tape which travelled at 15 inches per second .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #82:1>
Four recording heads spun across this tape at very high speeds .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #83:1>
The video signal was thus laid down at a writing speed that was adequate for the bandwidth of black and white television .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #84:1>
Quad has now largely been replaced by helical scan<l>ning .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #85:1>
This is simply another way of moving the heads in relation to the tape movement .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #86:1>
Instead of spinning the heads at right-angles to the direction of travel of the tape , they spin horizontally , but at a slight angle to the tape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #87:1>
This creates a series of diagonal , very closely spaced video tracks running across the tape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #88:1>
Because the tracks run at a very shallow angle each individual track is much longer than in Quad recording -
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #89:1>
in fact each track contains one field ( half a frame ) of video .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #90:1>
These tracks occupy the bulk of the tape , but there is space for a narrow audio band on one outside edge , as well as for a control track on the other edge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #91:1>
The other major development has been the gradual reduction of tape widths as technology has allowed more and more information to be stored in less and less space .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #92:1>
The earliest video recorders were black and white and used either 1 inch or 1/2 inch wide tape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #93:1>
They also used reel-to-reel tapes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #94:1>
With color came the first cassettes and the first domestic video machines .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #95:1>
Sony introduced their 3/4-inch U-Matic system in 1970 , and this has been refined since to a high professional standard .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #96:1>
In fact it is the only cassette to have survived from the early years of video .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #97:1>
It now exists as Low-Band and the better-quality High-Band , which is acceptable for broadcasting .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #98:1>
The most important innovations were the introduc<l>tion of Sony 's Betamax format in 1975 , shortly followed by JVC 's Home Video System ( VHS ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #99:1>
VHS has stood the test of time well .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #100:1>
In addition to the standard cassettes , which are still very widely used , compact VHS ( VHS-C ) and Super VHS ( S-VHS ) cassettes are available .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #101:1>
Compact VHS cassettes are simply shorter VHS tapes in a smaller cassette .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #102:1>
This makes them highly portable , but limits the running time to 45 minutes at standard speed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #103:1>
Most camcorders that are designed for use with this tape therefore offer a slower , long-play speed , to extend the playing time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #104:1>
S-VHS employs a higher-specification tape to eliminate video problems such as flickering colors in areas of the subject that have a finely striped pattern .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #105:1>
Betamax has fared less well .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #106:1>
It is obsolete as a domestic format .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #107:1>
The high-quality Beta SP runs costly metal tape at high speeds .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #108:1>
Another important recent format is Video 8 , which uses tapes only 8 mm wide .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #109:1>
This tape format offers quality as good as standard VHS , and Video 8 has the advantage over VHS-C of a running time of 90 minutes at standard speed , or three hours at long-play settings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #110:1>
Another advantage is that the format encodes the video and audio signals together , which means that the audio signals can benefit from the high writing speed tradition<l>ally reserved for the video tracks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #111:1>
The format has a slight drawback in that few VCRs are available that accept its tapes &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #112:1>
there are also few prerecorded Video 8 tapes available .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #113:1>
This means that your tapes have to be played back via the camcorder , which you connect to the television as you would your VCR .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #114:1>
As well as the tracks containing the audio and video information , video tape contains a control track .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #115:1>
This provides a field sync pulse , which controls the video image along with another sync pulse - the line sync - which is contained within the video information itself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #116:1>
The field sync pulse is normally laid down along one edge of the tape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-014 #117:1>
A separate stationary record/replay head monitors the pulses on the tape and adjusts the speed accordingly .

<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #1:1>
ATTACKING FROM SET PLAYS
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #2:1>
Just under half of all goals scored in the matches we have analyzed came from a set play or when possession was regained im<l>mediately following a set play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #3:1>
This makes set plays by far the most important single fac<l>tor in scoring goals and winning matches .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #4:1>
Further analysis revealed the importance of direct play in gaining set plays .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #5:1>
Almost 90% of set plays in the attacking third of the field were won from moves of five passes or less .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #6:1>
Direct play helps to increase the number of set plays , and set plays help to win soccer matches .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #7:1>
Teams do not generally set out with the aim of gaining set plays .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #8:1>
Set plays come as a by-product of positive play which puts pres<l>sure on opponents .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #9:1>
For example , a corner may result from a deflected shot at goal , or a free kick from a beaten defender 's despairing challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #10:1>
Set plays are second prizes when direct play has just failed to succeed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #11:1>
Basically , there are five things an attack<l>ing team can do which make it likely that de<l>fenders will concede a set play - either a throw-in or a free kick of some kind .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #12:1>
WAYS TO GAIN MORE SET PLAYS
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #13:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #14:1>
Passing to the back of the defence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #15:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #16:1>
Crossing to the back of the defence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #17:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #18:1>
Dribbling .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #19:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #20:1>
Pressuring defenders .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #21:1>
5.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #22:1>
Shooting .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #23:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #24:1>
Passing to the back of the defence
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #25:1>
Passes to the back of the defence always cause defenders problems .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #26:1>
If the ball is played past him , a defender will be in the un<l>comfortable position of having to turn and run towards his own goal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #27:1>
Safety should be at the top of his mind - assuming he can be first to the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #28:1>
His best option would be a pass back to the goalkeeper , but if this route is blocked he will either have to attempt to turn - which is very risky unless there is plenty of space - or play the ball out for a throw-in or a corner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #29:1>
If in doubt , good defenders will always play the ball dead .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #30:1>
Safety first is the golden rule in the defending third .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #31:1>
Lofted passes to the back of the defence often cause defenders more problems than ground balls .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #32:1>
Passes that call for the defender to turn and head the ball are especially diffi<l>cult and often the ball skids off the defender 's head and out of play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #33:1>
A pass over a defender 's head calls for him to turn and play an awk<l>ward bouncing ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #34:1>
Most defenders are un<l>comfortable in this situation and are happy to play the ball into touch .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #35:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #36:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #37:1>
Crossing
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #38:1>
Crosses to the back of the defence , especially into the prime target area ( see the chapter on Crosses ) , cause defenders maximum discom<l>fort .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #39:1>
Most of them , running back towards their own goal , will settle for putting the ball behind for a corner kick .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #40:1>
Players attacking down the wings some<l>times dwell on the ball , trying to find more space for a cross , then end up passing the ball back to a supporting player .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #41:1>
Most of the time they would do better to take a chance and try to get the cross in early .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #42:1>
If they succeed , the ball will get into the prime target area at the back of the defence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #43:1>
If they fail , quite often it is because the cross is knocked away by a de<l>fender for a throw-in or a corner .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #44:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #45:1>
Dribbling
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #46:1>
Most defenders would consider they had won a duel with a dribbler if they had put the ball out for a corner or a throw .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #47:1>
In fact , if a set play results from a dribble , the attacker , not the defender , has come out on top .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #48:1>
A set play , par<l>ticularly in the attacking third of the field , is a perfectly acceptable result from a dribble , and another good reason for more players to dribble more often in attack .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #49:1>
Dribbling does not only produce throw-ins and corners .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #50:1>
The FIFA report on the 1982 World Cup reported that three of every five penalties and free kicks around the penalty area were given for fouls on people dribbling .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #51:1>
More goals are scored , directly and indi<l>rectly , from free kicks than from corners and throw-ins combined .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #52:1>
Dribbling is an important part of the game in the attacking third , and most teams could boost their goals tally simply by dribbling more in advanced positions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #53:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #54:1>
Pressuring defenders
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #55:1>
Pressure is exerted on a player in possession of the ball by challenging him or moving toward him , cutting down on the time and space he has available in which to play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #56:1>
If a defender is first to the ball when it is played to the back of the defence , an attacker should challenge him as soon as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #57:1>
When time and space are limited , high demands are put on technique , and defenders who are not con<l>fident about their technique will frequently panic .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #58:1>
When this happens the ball can go anywhere .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #59:1>
When a defender has once been forced into a position like this in a match , he will start to worry about it happening again - which leads to more uncertainty and more panic .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #60:1>
Any tactic which discomfits defenders and encourages them to panic is useful to an attacking side in increasing the number of set plays they are awarded .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #61:1>
Making sure that defenders on the ball are continually put under pressure certainly comes into this category .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #62:1>
5.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #63:1>
Shooting
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #64:1>
The evidence that direct play increases the number of shooting opportunities , and that the more shots a team has , the more likely it is to score , is overwhelming .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #65:1>
It is dealt with in detail in the chapter on Shooting .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #66:1>
It is equally true that the more often a team shoots , the more secondary shooting oppor<l>tunities it creates .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #67:1>
Some of these come from rebounds and others from corners , either because the shot hits a defender or because the goalkeeper pushes it wide or over the bar .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #68:1>
Teams that are prepared to shoot at every opportunity are difficult to defend against .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #69:1>
Defenders are under extra pressure not to allow the attackers a sight of goal and are therefore more likely to make a mistake or give away a set play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #70:1>
Applying these five positive principles will increase the number of set plays a team is awarded in a game .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #71:1>
This is not to say that a team should go out looking for set plays , simply that direct play and a positive approach will produce more set plays as a matter of course .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #72:1>
And with set plays involved in nearly a half of all goals scored , more set plays can only mean more goals .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #73:1>
WHY SET PLAYS PRODUCE GOALS
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #74:1>
Set plays have always been a major factor in winning soccer matches .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #75:1>
The more important the match and the closer the contest , the more likely it is that the match will be decided by a set play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #76:1>
Twenty-seven goals were scored in the six World Cup finals be<l>tween 1966 and 1986 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #77:1>
Of these , thirteen came from moves started by set plays and five more when the ball was regained immediately fol<l>lowing a set play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #78:1>
There are four major reasons why set plays are such an important source of goals .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #79:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #80:1>
A dead ball
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #81:1>
The ball is still and on the ground or , in the case of a throw-in , safe in the thrower 's hand .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #82:1>
A still ball is much easier to play than one which is moving .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #83:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #84:1>
Lack of pressure
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #85:1>
Defending players must be at least ten yards from the ball at corners and free kicks , making it difficult to disturb the kicker or put on the kind of pressure that causes inaccu<l>racy .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #86:1>
This does not apply to throw-ins , but there the thrower has the considerable advantage of using his hands .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #87:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #88:1>
Extra attacking players
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #89:1>
At set plays teams can put seven or eight players in attacking positions , something that never happened in the normal course of play .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #90:1>
Having so many players forward makes it more difficult for the defenders to clear the ball , which is why so many goals come from regained possessions following set plays .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #91:1>
The advantage does not come simply from weight of numbers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #92:1>
A set play allows players to take up positions that suit their individual strengths &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #93:1>
tall central defenders can get into position to head for goal , for example , while one or two good volleyers of the ball take up positions to fire back half-clearances (
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #94:1>
see the chapter Winning the Ball in the Attacking Third ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #95:1>
Players can be positioned for all eventual<l>ities .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #96:1>
For instance , a back-header from a near post corner might go into the goal , but it might also be flicked into the mid-goal area or to the far post , and players should be posi<l>tioned to take these chances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #97:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #98:1>
Rehearsal
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #99:1>
The more teams practise and rehearse their set moves , the more accurate and well-coordi<l>nated their performance will become .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #100:1>
The more accurate and well-coordinated their performance , the more successful a team will be , and with success comes more confidence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #101:1>
First , however , comes practice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #102:1>
There is a further benefit from rehearsing moves .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #103:1>
It helps players develop their con<l>centration .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #104:1>
It is not enough for a player to know what he should be doing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #105:1>
He must con<l>centrate in order to do it effectively and to do it whenever it is required .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #106:1>
Players who lose concentration tend to drift out of the game .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #107:1>
Rehearsing pre-planned moves helps players to be alert and watchful .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #108:1>
The whole process of rehearsal improves their concen<l>tration and leads toward a disciplined team performance , with every individual correctly performing the task he has been given .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #109:1>
There is one final point to make about set plays in general before moving on to particu<l>lar kinds of set plays .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #110:1>
Variety is not a virtue where set plays are concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #111:1>
At least , if there is variety , it should be variety around a single theme .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #112:1>
THROW-INS
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #113:1>
Players seem to relax their concentration more at throw-ins than at any other time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #114:1>
Throw-ins are underestimated as attacking weapons , and may be looked on as simply a method of restarting the game .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #115:1>
They should , in fact , be looked on as a possible route toward winning it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #116:1>
There are six key things to remember to make a throw-in an attacking move .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #117:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #118:1>
Take the throw quickly
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #119:1>
If defending players ' concentration lapses - as it often does when the ball goes out of play - this should be exposed immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #120:1>
The throw must be taken as quickly as possible , which means that the man nearest the ball should take the throw .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #121:1>
The only exception to this rule is for a long throw in the attacking third of the field ( see below ) , when time needs to be taken for extra players to move forward into attacking posi<l>tions and the ball given to the long throw specialist .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #122:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #123:1>
Throw to an unmarked player
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #124:1>
An unmarked attacking player should be able to initiate forward play faster than any other , so he will be the best player to receive the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #125:1>
If for some reason he is not in a posi<l>tion to initiate forward play , then he should not be given the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #126:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #127:1>
Throw forward
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #128:1>
In accordance with the principles of direct play the ball should be thrown forward where possible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #129:1>
There are , of course , exceptions to this rule , such as a throw back to the goal<l>keeper in the defending third of the field .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #130:1>
In the attacking third of the field , though , the ball should always go forward if possible , and preferably to a player who can turn with the ball .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #131:1>
If the player who is to receive the ball is marked , he should always be supported .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #132:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #133:1>
Throw for ease of control
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #134:1>
A throw-in is a pass .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #135:1>
The ball should be de<l>livered with the same consideration as a pass , and thrown at a pace , and an angle , which makes it as easy as possible for the re<l>ceiver to bring it under control and as diffi<l>cult as possible for any defender to challenge him for it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #136:1>
If the thrower wants the ball headed back to him , he should aim to deliver it chest high .
<ICE-GB:W2D-015 #137:1>
This will make it easy for the receiver to move towards the ball and head it through its top half , directing it down to the feet of the thrower .

Tools and Materials
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #2:1>
Pencils
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #3:1>
The pencil is the original disposable drawing instrument , economical and efficient .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #4:1>
Pencils are controllable and versatile - producing an infinite tonal range which is both permanent and adjustable - and black graphite ones , at least , are easy to erase .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #5:1>
Before pencils were invented , thin rods of silver , zinc or lead were used for drawing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #6:1>
These are collectively known as silverpoint .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #7:1>
The term &ldquo; lead pencil &rdquo; is a complete misnomer -
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #8:1>
it contains no lead , and the word pencillus , meaning &ldquo; little tail , &rdquo; refers to the brush used by the Romans to write on papyrus .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #9:1>
When graphite ( pure black carbon ) was first discovered at Borrowdale in Cumbria back in 1564 , it was mistakenly called plumbago - that which acts like lead - and the association has stuck ever since .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #10:1>
It is excusable to take the humble pencil for granted , but once it was worth its weight in gold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #11:1>
The Borrowdale mine was the only deposit ever found containing graphite of such purity .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #12:1>
It was worked for only six weeks of the year ,
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #13:1>
shipments to London were protected by armed guards , and until 1860 the English Guild of Pencilmakers held the world monopoly on the sale of the thin square sticks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #14:1>
In the 17th century , the German carpenter Staedtler used sulphur and antimony to bind crushed graphite into usable sticks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #15:1>
Pencil &ldquo; lead &rdquo; today is composed of less pure graphite - mostly from Mexico - and Bavarian clay , fired like porcelain in a kiln .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #16:1>
The process was devised in 1795 by a man called Cont&eacute; , an officer in Napoleon 's army , when war cut off supplies of the English and German products .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #17:1>
And for the first time , pencils could be graded from hard to soft by varying the relative proportions of graphite and clay .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #18:1>
The firm of Faber was established near Nuremberg in 1761 , and by 1840 was producing the familiar hexagonal pencil in its standard size and grades of hardness .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #19:1>
A classification of the time had HH for engineers , H for architects , F for sketching and B for shading .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #20:1>
Pencils were not made in the USA until the 1850s , when Alfred Berol founded the Eagle Pencil Company .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #21:1>
The more clay there is in a pencil lead , the harder it is .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #22:1>
The midpoint for hardness ( or degree ) and the most general-purpose of pencils is HB , standing for hard and black .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #23:1>
Softer and blacker pencils of degree B to 6B are favoured by artists and designers , for freehand sketching and rendering (
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #24:1>
2B is the degree most favoured for general-purpose work around the designer 's studio ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #25:1>
On the other side of the scale , pencils of degree H to 9H are used mainly for technical and engineering drafting - the very hard ones being used by stonemasons and steel workers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #26:1>
Odd grades include F ( for firm ) , between HB and H , used by shorthand writers , and the extremely soft EB and EE .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #27:1>
The traditional wooden pencil has the lead , which also now contains some wax for smoothness , bonded into a sandwich of mature Californian incense cedar slats .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #28:1>
Despite there being 10 billion pencils produced each year , there is apparently no threat to the environment as the annual logging in the Pacific northwest does not exceed the growth rate .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #29:1>
A good quality pencil has a bonded lead , usually etched with acid , that will not shatter inside the wood if the pencil is dropped , nor slide out in use .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #30:1>
The six-sided cross-section of one pencil design is an ingenious way of preventing the pencil from rolling off the drawing board .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #31:1>
Recent developments in pencil technology include Berol 's Karisma Aquarelle and Rexel 's Derwent Sketching &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #32:1>
these are water-soluble graphite pencils in three grades - light ( HB ) , medium ( 4B ) and dark ( 8B ) - for a line and wash effect , monochromatic equivalents of the Swiss-made Caran d 'Ache √¨ watercolour √Æ pencils .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #33:1>
It should be remembered , however , that water makes paper cockle and it should be stretched beforehand .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #34:1>
Polymer-based leads for drafting on translucent film or Mylar were first introduced in the 1960s by Faber-Castell .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #35:1>
The clay binder of the traditional pencil is replaced by a combi<l>nation of oil and a polymer resin .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #36:1>
This produces a lead that is stronger , denser and harder-wearing than conventional lead &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #37:1>
a solvent-based eraser is required , however , to correct any mistakes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #38:1>
Coloured pencils are manufactured in a similar way , from a mixture of white kaolin , waxes , pigments and adhesive binders , but are not fired .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #39:1>
The range of colours ( most suppliers have 72 ) can include metallics , and both warm and cool greys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #40:1>
Some types , such as Berol 's Verithin , are hard and thin &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #41:1>
others , such as the Prismacolor line ( called Karisma in the UK ) are soft , flat and blendable , with the finish of dry gouache .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #42:1>
Other indispensable pencils include a non-reproduceable blue for &ldquo; invisibly &rdquo; marking artwork , and a greasy Chinagraph that will draw on anything , including glossy photographs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #43:1>
Clutch pencils first appeared in the 1900s , using leads originally produced by Faber for use in compasses .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #44:1>
These have spring-loaded jaws , activated by a push button that also houses the sharpener .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #45:1>
The lead can be withdrawn into the barrel for protection when the pencil is not in action .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #46:1>
In a recent article in the British journal Design Week on essential studio equipment , Glen Tutssel , creative director of London practice Michael Peters , said he would never flee from a flame-engulfed studio without his battered 15-year old Faber-Castell clutch pencil .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #47:1>
Push-button mechanical pencils from firms such as Pentel are now replacing the clutch pencil .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #48:1>
These come with leads fine enough not to need sharpening , in different lead thicknesses ( 0.3-0.9mm ) for consistent weights of line , and look sufficiently hi-tech .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #49:1>
They are inexpensive and lightweight , and the round ones can be revolved between the fingers on long stretches of line to achieve an even finish .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #50:1>
The removable button usually reveals an eraser and a cleaning wire .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #51:1>
Top-of-the-line ones have auto-lead feed for non-stop drawing and adjustable lead protector sleeves .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #52:1>
Designed for drafting , mechanical pencils are also useful for carrying around for sketching at briefing meetings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #53:1>
Pastels
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #54:1>
Pastels are used for subtle shading and rendering rather than line drawing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #55:1>
Weakly bound pigment has been used to colour drawings from the 15th century , and was revived by the 19th-century Impressionist Edgar Degas .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #56:1>
Soft pastel is used by designers as a quicker substitute for the blending effects best produced by airbrush .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #57:1>
The medium is extremely fragile and vulnerable and the drawing needs to be protected with pva fixative as soon as it is completed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #58:1>
The act of fixing the pastels , however , can make the colours darker .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #59:1>
Soft pastels are made from powdered pigment bound in gum tragacanth or methyl cellulose , and usually contain a fungicide .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #60:1>
There are over 550 shades , but for most purposes between 50 and 100 will suffice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #61:1>
A boxed set is a beautiful object in its own right and should last for ever -
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #62:1>
but designers should ensure that the chosen brand sells single stick replacements for the commonly used colours .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #63:1>
Unwrapped pastels with a square cross-section such as Faber-Castell 's Polychromos range ( 72 shades ) are more versatile than the round paper-wrapped types -
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #64:1>
they can be applied quickly using the long edge and do not roll off the drawing board .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #65:1>
Pastels can be used directly , or scraped into powder using a scalpel and applied with cotton wool .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #66:1>
They can then be manipulated and blended using the finger or a proprietory rolled-paper stump ( known to artists as a tortillon ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #67:1>
An eraser can be used to create the effect of highlights .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #68:1>
Pastel dust can also be dissolved in solvent and applied in broad &ldquo; streaky &rdquo; strokes like a marker .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #69:1>
Oil pastels are more flexible versions of crayons , being made from pigments , hydrocarbon waxes and fats .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #70:1>
Heat melts them ( hot hands make them harder to control ) , and white spirit can be used to dissolve them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #71:1>
Effects useful for the backgrounds and textures can be achieved by combining oil pastels with water colour or acrylics .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #72:1>
Chalk and so-called cont&eacute; crayons crayons ( in the &ldquo; traditional &rdquo; colours of sanguine , sepia and bistre , as well as black and white ) used on mid-to-dark toned paper is also a time-honoured method of producing an effective &ldquo; fully toned &rdquo; image directly and economically .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #73:1>
The white chalk creates highlights of great luminosity .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #74:1>
Pens
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #75:1>
Pens make more permanent marks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #76:1>
And whilst a cult fountain pen such as a Lamy Safari , Parker Duofold or Mont Blanc Meisterst&uumlaut;ck Diplomat Blanc Meisterst¬∏ck Diplomat will be useful for signing autographs , contracts or cheques , fine-lined water-based fibretips from Edding or Nikko are more likely to be found around the designer 's studio as general-purpose sketching pens .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #77:1>
A visit to a stationer or graphic arts supplier will unveil a bewildering selection of pens to choose from - and everyone has their own favourite type for writing with .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #78:1>
There are ballpoints , rolling-ballpoints , felt-tips , brushtips and fibretips , and the ink they each use varies from water-soluble to indelible and permanent .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #79:1>
Each has its place in the designer 's studio .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #80:1>
The common ballpoint - invented in 1938 by Hungarian emigr&eacute; Laszlo Bir&oacute; Bir√õ , and popularized by Frenchman Marcel Bich - can be used to create crisp edges on presentation drawings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #81:1>
Daring designers like the thrill of not being able to erase ballpoint lines .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #82:1>
The nitrogen-powered Fisher ballpoint , developed for NASA , will write at any angle , even pointing upwards , under water and at 50 degrees below freezing point .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #83:1>
It has a shelf life of 100 years and will write for three miles before the ink runs out .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #84:1>
For freehand drawing it is difficult to find better than a dip pen tipped with a Gillott 303 or &ldquo; lithographic &rdquo; 1950 nib - with which the line width varies responsively according to hand pressure - using non-waterproof indian ink for its flow qualities .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #85:1>
Technical pens for stencilling or drafting consistent lines in indian ink on tracing paper or film have been in use since the 1930s , notably the conventionally nibbed Graphos .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #86:1>
Before that , engineers used ruling pens looking like adjustable forceps , the blob of ink being kept in its place by a miracle meniscus of surface tension .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #87:1>
The Rotring Rapidograph was introduced in 1952 , a tubular fountain pen with a removable cylindrical nib regulated by a wire filament available in different widths from 0.lmm to 2mm .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #88:1>
The aim of all developments since has been to ameliorate the big problems of blobbing and of the indian ink 's drying and clogging the nib , and to obviate the irritating need to keep stopping and shaking the pen in order to keep the ink flowing evenly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #89:1>
All manner of inventions have been tried , from damp and hermetically sealed caps , ultrasonic cleaners and standby humidifiers , to disposable capillary cartridges - and completely disposable pens , such as Letraset 's Letratech .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #90:1>
Pens are available with tungsten carbide ( most makes ) , &ldquo; synthetic jewel &rdquo; ( Faber-Castell 's TG1-J ) or ceramic ( Pentel 's Ceranomatic ) tips - all proprietory proprietary solutions to the same problem of wear - for drawing on to matt drafting film .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #91:1>
If line<l->board is being used , it should be cleaned with lighter-fuel and tracing paper dusted with talcum powder to remove grease before a technical pen is used , to prevent smudged or broken lines .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #92:1>
Technical pens are also useful for stippling and freehand hatching .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #93:1>
Computer-aided design systems and their output devices make even greater demands on the technical pen for high-speed precision and reliability .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #94:1>
Companies such as Staedtler address this market with their Marsplot &ldquo; sys √¨ system , &rdquo; which also includes plastic-tipped points ( for drawing on to glossy film ) , pressurized ballpoint and rolling-ball cartridges .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #95:1>
Erasers
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #96:1>
Of course in theory a good craftsperson never needs an eraser .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #97:1>
But the person who never made a mistake never made anything - and an eraser can be a creative tool , too .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #98:1>
The grubby rubber that was only good for smearing meticulously prepared artwork is now a thing of the past , thanks to modern-day plastic erasers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #99:1>
These can be cut and shaped to make a sharp clean edge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #100:1>
Putty or kneadable rubbers that can be moulded to a point are useful for picking out highlights on presentation drawings .
<ICE-GB:W2D-016 #101:1>
Inks and polymer-based pencils need their own solvent-based non-abrasive vinyl erasers which can be used in conjunction with a stainless steel erasing shield to restrict the eraser to the area where it is needed .

Baits
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #3:1>
Depending on their views and the nature of their interest in fishing running water , be it pleasure or specimen oriented , different people will tend towards different baits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #4:1>
What these baits all have in common is that they give the angler a confidence that grows the more often they use their particular choice .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #5:1>
PERSONAL CHOICE
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #6:1>
There will be anglers who use their favourite choice of bait no matter which species they are fishing for .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #7:1>
This familiarity with the bait gives him confidence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #8:1>
Whilst some of the sugg<l>estions of just what bait you should use for each species may be correct , this could be as a result of the particular bait or baits having been used exclusively on a given water .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #9:1>
There is nothing to say that an alternative choice could not catch fish in the same location , particularly if it is used correctly and confidently .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #10:1>
Fishing on running water , be it on small upper , non-tidal reaches of river or the larger tidal stretches , is very much akin to stillwater fishing in that styles and , more importantly here , baits come into fashion from time to time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #11:1>
This often happens when large catches or individual large fish are caught and publicised by the captor .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #12:1>
Greater weight is added to this if the angler in question is a noted match or specialist angler .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #13:1>
The bait used may have been an ordinary one , that we all use from time to time and it is quite possible that the next time it is used , the results will be different , particularly if the bait has been used extensively and the fish have become wise to it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #14:1>
Fish soon recognise which bait is safe and they learn to avoid the one with the hook in it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #15:1>
Super Baits
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #16:1>
Many secret additives exist , mainly in anglers ' minds , and many so-called magic mixes of attractors appear , for sale , for the many fish-<l>hungry anglers to add to their baits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #17:1>
There are some comparisons with carp fishing here , in that it is very easy to become preoccupied with the smell or colour of the particular bait you use .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #18:1>
Some of the additives may work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #19:1>
We have all tried adding something to make our bait better or at least a bit different , and if it helps to catch , then it strengthens confidence , leaving time to concentrate more on presenta<l>tion or location .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #20:1>
However , remember that if you start using Bloggs Bloggs 's &lsquo; Barbel Booster &rsquo; additive addi<l>tive , it is possible that every other angler is doing the same and you might just as well be fishing simple maggot or bread .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #21:1>
Be Different
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #22:1>
To summarise , it is highly likely that the big catch or big fish that inspired you was caught , not because of a super bait , but because the angler tried something new or at least some<l>thing different to what everybody else was using .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #23:1>
The moral is , try and learn what every<l>body else is using and then try something better or at least different .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #24:1>
It may be that only slightly better quality bait will be necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #25:1>
If you fish with a quality bait in the right place , at the right time , you will stand more of a chance of catching than if you follow somebody else 's lead .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #26:1>
By the time it is publicised , it is already too late .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #27:1>
Quality Baits
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #28:1>
Accepting that you wish to be successful at catching whatever it is your sights are set on , be it lots of small to medium-size fish or fewer medium-size to large specimens , then the most important thing to remember is that the bait you use must be of the highest quality .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #29:1>
It is no good just accepting that a bait catches because it is what it is &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #30:1>
some baits have a peak level of attraction and to use them in any other condi<l>tion will prove fruitless , even to the point that the fish may be repelled .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #31:1>
Many a tale has been told of the angler who cannot catch using a simple bait like bread or maggot whilst his near neighbour is pulling fish out , one after the other .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #32:1>
It is possible that the bait of the successful angler is at its peak of condition .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #33:1>
His maggots are kept in clean bran and are sweet and attractive to the fish , whilst the other angler is using sweaty , smelly , stale maggots , bought from a supplier who only sells maggots because he has to !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #34:1>
It is far better to buy from a source where care is taken over storage and cleanliness (
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #35:1>
more on this subject as we progress ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #36:1>
Confidence
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #37:1>
Hopefully you will be able to see that there is a need to give more thought to your bait than perhaps you have before .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #38:1>
You will be surprised how much knowing you are using the best quality bait will do for your confidence and success , whichever species you are after .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #39:1>
What follows in the remainder of this chapter is a range of successful baits and details of how to get them to their best condition as necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #40:1>
This will include hook baits and groundbaits (
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #41:1>
the latter can be as important to success as the hook bait ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #42:1>
MAGGOTS
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #43:1>
Maggots are available everywhere , easy to use and will catch almost every species of fish that swims in a lake or river !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #44:1>
The fact that all this is true leads to a lot of misuse of maggots and , likewise , a lot of disappointment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #45:1>
The humble maggot , in one of its three forms - the large white , the pinkie or the squatt - is so readily available that many anglers pop into their nearest tackle dealer and purchase a half-pint or one pint of whichever maggot is available !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #46:1>
In many cases these will be plain white or a mix of white and coloured maggots .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #47:1>
The angler will then proceed to go fishing the same day or the following day with what he presumes is a good bait .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #48:1>
He will not give a thought to their condition , other than to comment if they smell badly !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #49:1>
Dealer Attitude
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #50:1>
The maggot is an excellent bait , but the quality of a shop-bought supply will depend on the dealer 's attitude to his bait .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #51:1>
If he has no interest in angling and the shop operates in some other capacity as well as fishing tackle , it is unlikely that time will be available for bait care .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #52:1>
The bait will probably be stored in a fridge in the same medium in which it was supplied from the maggot farm ( invariably sawdust ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #53:1>
The maggots will become very smelly and contaminated which will undoubtedly deter fish from taking them when offered on the hook (
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #54:1>
see fig 23 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #55:1>
Also , some of the maggots will be old and they may start to turn to casters within hours of buying .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #56:1>
If the maggots are purchased from a good-<l>quality tackle dealer who sets out to supply a good service to anglers , both in tackle and bait , he will take the trouble to set up a proper system of bait care .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #57:1>
This will start with cleaning off the sawdust in which the maggots were supplied , using a vibrating riddle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #58:1>
The cleaned maggots will then be placed in clean trays and ground maize added to further clean and freshen them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #59:1>
They will be refrigerated until sold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #60:1>
Whilst in store , intermittent turning and riddling continues to remove any dead maggots , skins or casters .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #61:1>
At the point of sale , the bait will be topped up with ground maize to keep it clean and fresh .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #62:1>
Match Anglers
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #63:1>
If at all possible , you should locate a bait supplier that is like the latter .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #64:1>
Match anglers will usually frequent a better dealer , so , if you can , ask where they get their maggots from .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #65:1>
If you cannot find a good supplier or distance prohibits using one , then you will have to make do with the &lsquo; dirty &rsquo; local supply and take some steps towards bringing the bait up to standard .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #66:1>
There is no question of it being necessary or not -
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #67:1>
if you really wish to be suc<l>cessful at catching fish of any species , your bait must be of the highest possible quality .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #68:1>
If you opt for using the local supply , be it dirty , moderate or first-class , there is one exercise which will improve them all .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #69:1>
Only the degree will vary from source to source .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #70:1>
Assuming that you have to buy from the local corner shop which sells maggots , it will be worth finding out how many gallons of maggots are used weekly and what frequency of supply the dealer has !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #71:1>
Once you find a shop that gets a weekly supply , find out on which day the bait arrives and buy your bait as soon after that day as possible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #72:1>
A good fresh maggot will have a black feed spot visible through the skin .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #73:1>
Maggots without this may be quite old .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #74:1>
Clean and Prepare your Own
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #75:1>
If you have fresh maggots , riddle them clean of the sawdust or whatever they were supplied in , with a riddle tray ( see fig 24 ) , by shaking the tray briskly over a larger container .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #76:1>
Recover any maggots that drop through and then tip all of them into a bowl containing ground maize or dampened bran and allow them half an hour to wriggle and clean themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #77:1>
Repeat the process again , putting the maggots into fresh dry bran and then place them in the fridge to keep them cool .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #78:1>
It is important not to put too many maggots into a bait box .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #79:1>
If in doubt , use two boxes !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #80:1>
The bait needs room to breathe &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #81:1>
too many maggots squashed into a box will sweat and become smelly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #82:1>
In the case of the better bait supply , a change from the original maize to fresh maize or bran will help keep it in top condition .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #83:1>
Make a habit of cleaning your bait when you buy it and you will gain an edge on the anglers who do not .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #84:1>
Coloured Bait
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #85:1>
Coloured maggots are best purchased ready-<l>dyed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #86:1>
The professional colouring is stronger and costs no more anyway .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #87:1>
Red , bronze and pink are the most popular colours after white .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #88:1>
More on colour in the appropriate chapters .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #89:1>
CASTERS
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #90:1>
For many species , casters can be a superior bait , but they have to be just right .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #91:1>
Like maggots , if they are not at their peak of attrac<l>tion and quality , they will be rejected .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #92:1>
For many years the caster was discarded as useless by anglers who used maggots as baits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #93:1>
However , when a high percentage of maggots turned to casters just before and during the day of fishing , the casters in the loose feed had the effect of conditioning the fish to feed on casters instead of maggots .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #94:1>
Fish could be seen feeding but not on hook baits .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #95:1>
It was disco<l>vered that casters sank at certain stages in their development and that if the supply of casters were at this stage , then feeding with loose caster and hooking single caster carefully could produce bumper bags as the fish ( all species ) , became preoccupied with a delicious bait
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #96:1>
( see Fig 25 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #97:1>
Top-quality casters can be obtained from &lsquo; good &rsquo; tackle dealers , the operative word being &lsquo; good &rsquo; , because to produce good-quality casters it requires the continuous care and interest of the dealer to riddle off casters several times a day to ensure they are collected and stored in peak conditions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #98:1>
This is too much for many tackle shops , but the ability to supply good-quality caster will ensure the tackle dealer gains good trade from regular customers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #99:1>
It will pay to locate a good source and use it regularly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #100:1>
Home-Produced Casters
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #101:1>
It is possible to produce casters at home .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #102:1>
We all do it to some degree , by accident sometimes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #103:1>
The difficulty is producing the quantity we may need at exactly the right moment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #104:1>
If you wish to do so , the important point to remember is to purchase fresh maggots with a feed spot visible .
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #105:1>
This will ensure that the bait is fresh from the bait breeder !
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #106:1>
Ensure that you have bait of one age -
<ICE-GB:W2D-017 #107:1>
some dealers may supply bait of mixed supplies which will mean casters being produced over several days instead of within several hours .

DRIVE BELTS &dotted-line; [ 12 ]
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #2:1>
On the OHV engine both the alternator and water pump are driven by a &lsquo; V &rsquo; belt , but on the OHC engine only the alternator is driven by an external belt from the crankshaft pulley , in this case a &lsquo; Poly-Vee &rsquo; multi-groove belt , although models with power steering also use this belt to drive the steering pump .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #3:1>
It is important that the correct tension of the &lsquo; V &rsquo; or &lsquo; Poly-Vee &rsquo; drive belt Poly-Vee √≠ drive belt is maintained to ensure efficient operation of the electrical ( and in the case of the OHV engine , cooling ) system .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #4:1>
Too great a tension will place excessive strain upon the alternator or water pump bearings and cause undue wear on the belt .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #5:1>
To test the belt tension , press the belt down at a point midway on the longest run between pulleys ( Fig. A:25 ) , using firm thumb pressure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #6:1>
The belt should deflect 13 mm ( 0.5 in ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #7:1>
If retensioning of the belt is necessary , you will first have to remove the inner wing access plate on OHV models by undoing the two retaining screws , unclipping the plate at its leading edge and pulling it downwards (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #8:1>
Fig. A:26 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #9:1>
The plate is held at the bottom by a plastic pin which need not be undone as the plate can be flexed out of the way .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #10:1>
On both engine types , slacken the alternator mounting bolts/<l>nuts ( Figs. A:27 &ampersand; A:28 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #11:1>
Pull or lever the alternator away from the engine , applying any force to the drive end bracket only , until the correct tension is obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #12:1>
Note that some OHC engines have a tension adjuster screw ( A , Fig.28 ) and this can be used instead of levering the alternator .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #13:1>
Tighten the alternator adjuster slide bolt before tightening the mounting bolts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #14:1>
Recheck the tension and readjust as necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #15:1>
Refit the access plate on OHV models .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #16:1>
Check the condition of the drive belt periodically and replace it if it is excessively worn , stretched or showing signs of fraying .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #17:1>
Replacing the belt as a matter of course every 2 years or 24,000 miles will prevent the possibility of an unexpected and inconvenient breakage .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #18:1>
To replace the drive belt , proceed as detailed for adjustment previously and detach the belt from the pulleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #19:1>
Fit the new belt and adjust the tension as detailed previously .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #20:1>
Run the engine at a fast-idle for about 5 minutes , then recheck the belt tension .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #21:1>
Do not attempt to lever a new belt onto the pulleys as this will damage both the belt and the pulleys - especially in the case of the &lsquo; Poly-Vee &rs Poly-Vee √≠ belt .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #22:1>
NOTE :
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #23:1>
The tension of a new belt should be rechecked after approximately 100 miles as it will stretch after initial use .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #24:1>
CLUTCH MECHANISM &dotted-line; [ 13 ]
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #25:1>
The clutch cable should be checked and adjusted as necessary to take up any slack caused by wear of the clutch components .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #26:1>
The clutch actuation mechanism is first checked by measuring the full stroke of the clutch pedal after having operated it a few times to settle the components (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #27:1>
Fig. A:29 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #28:1>
If the stroke is not within the specified limits the clutch cable must be adjusted .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #29:1>
Adjust the cable by slackening its locknut at the bellcrank lever on the front of the gearbox ( Fig. A:3O ) , then screwing the adjuster nut in the appropriate direction to increase or decrease the pedal travel .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #30:1>
Pump the clutch pedal a few times before checking the adjustment , and if correct , retighten the locknut .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #31:1>
Smear the exposed thread of the cable end with multipurpose grease to prevent corrosion .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #32:1>
BRAKES - FRONT &dotted-line; [ 14 ]
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #33:1>
Front Brake Pads
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #34:1>
All 309 models are fitted with a front brake pad wear warning light .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #35:1>
As the pad friction material wears down to the minimum pad thickness ( 2 mm ) , insulation on an electrical contact in the pad wears through , exposing the contact to the brake disc , so completing a circuit which illuminates a warning light at the fascia .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #36:1>
Although front brake inspection is not included in the manufacturer 's recommended service schedule , because it is assumed that the wear warning system will indicate when pads need replacing , we recommend that front brake pads be checked for wear at least every 12,000 miles or 12 months as follows :
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #37:1>
Slacken the front wheel bolts , raise and SAFELY support the front of the car and remove the front wheels .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #38:1>
The thickness of the pads can be checked by looking into the end of the brake caliper calliper (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #39:1>
Fig. A:31
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #40:1>
Measure the distance between the face of the pad backing plate and the contact face ( &lsquo; x &rsquo; , Fig. A:31 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #41:1>
When this distance is reduced to , or approaching 2 mm or less , the pads must be replaced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #42:1>
NOTE :
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #43:1>
Whenever one or more pads require replacement , both pads on both front brakes should be replaced as a set , otherwise brake balance will be adversely affected .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #44:1>
After checking the brake pads , refit the road wheels and lower the car to the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #45:1>
Tighten the wheel bolts to the specified torque .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #46:1>
BRAKES - REAR &dotted-line; [ 15 ]
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #47:1>
Rear Brake Linings ( not 1.9 GTi )
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #48:1>
Although the thickness of the rear brake linings can be checked without removing the drums and by looking through an inspection opening at the backplate , it is advisable to remove the drums for a thorough inspection .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #49:1>
Slacken the rear wheel bolts then raise and support the rear of the car -
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #50:1>
see SAFETY PROCEDURES .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #51:1>
Remove the road wheels .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #52:1>
If you wish only to look at the lining thickness via the backplate opening , locate and remove the plug at the rear of the backplate , near the handbrake cable (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #53:1>
Fig. A:32 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #54:1>
Check the thickness of the shoe linings through the hole , with the aid of a torch and a mirror .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #55:1>
It may be necessary to scrape paint from the edge of the shoe to determine the lining thickness .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #56:1>
If the lining thickness is 1,5 mm ( 1/16 in ) or near to it ( Fig. A:33 ) , the shoes should be replaced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #57:1>
To inspect the brakes thoroughly : -
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #58:1>
1 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #59:1>
Release the handbrake and remove the brake drum and wheel bearing -
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #60:1>
see BRAKES .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #61:1>
2 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #62:1>
With the drum removed brush out the brake lining dust , taking care to avoid inhaling it or getting it in the wheel bearing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #63:1>
The brake shoes should be renewed if the lining thickness is 1,5 mm ( 1/16 in ) or near to it (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #64:1>
Fig. A:33 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #65:1>
The rear brake shoes are self-adjusting and do not require regular adjustment .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #66:1>
If the linings need renewing , refer to BRAKES .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #67:1>
Brake shoes must always be renewed in sets of four &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #68:1>
on no account should only one pair of shoes be renewed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #69:1>
Also inspect the brake linings for oil , grease or brake fluid contamination .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #70:1>
If present , the shoes should be renewed once the cause has been established and dealt with &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #71:1>
this should be attended to immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #72:1>
Inspect the wheel cylinders for signs of fluid leakage , lifting the rubber boots with a screwdriver blade to check for excessive fluid build-up behind them (
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #73:1>
Fig. A:34 ) . if
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #74:1>
If present , the cylinder or the seals should be renewed immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #75:1>
Before refitting the brake drums , check the operation of the self-adjust mechanism to ensure that it is functioning properly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #76:1>
If the mechanism is not working correctly , it will cause excessive brake pedal travel and the cause must be established and dealt with .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #77:1>
NOTE :
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #78:1>
Whenever one or more pads require replacement , both pads on both rear brakes should be replaced as a set , otherwise brake balance will be adversely affected .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #79:1>
After checking the brake pads , refit the road wheels and lower the car to the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #80:1>
Tighten the wheel bolts to the specified torque .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #81:1>
Handbrake Cable Adjustment
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #82:1>
The handbrake should be checked to ensure it is operating correctly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #83:1>
Check that the cable follows its correct run and is correctly located in its guides .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #84:1>
The handbrake should not normally require adjustment as any free-play should be taken up automatically by the rear brake adjuster mechanism .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #85:1>
However , if movement at the handbrake lever is excessive ( more than 7 clicks on all models but 1.9 GTi , and more than 9 clicks on 1.9 GTi ) , of the lever ratchet ) due to the cable stretching , the cable can be adjusted as follows .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #86:1>
Adjustment ( not 1.9 GTi )
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #87:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #88:1>
Remove the driver 's seat and separate the fuel filler cap release handle and its shaft .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #89:1>
Undo the three handbrake lever cover screws and lift off the cover .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #90:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #91:1>
Raise and SAFELY support the rear of the car .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #92:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #93:1>
Pull the handbrake lever on to its third click , then slacken the locknut at the rear of the lever between the two cables ( A , Fig. A:36 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #94:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #95:1>
Check that both rear wheels are free to turn , then screw in the adjuster nut ( B , Fig. A:36 ) until both wheels are beginning to drag ( the brake shoes are rubbing against the drums ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #96:1>
5.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #97:1>
From this position apply the handbrake fully , then check that both rear wheels are locked .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #98:1>
Release the handbrake and check that the wheels are free to turn without any dragging .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #99:1>
If they are , tighten the adjuster locknut .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #100:1>
6.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #101:1>
Lower the car and refit the lever cover trim .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #102:1>
Adjustment - 1.9 GTi
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #103:1>
1.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #104:1>
With the car on the ground , remove the driver 's seat and separate the fuel filler cap release handle and its shaft .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #105:1>
Undo the three handbrake lever cover screws and lift off the cover .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #106:1>
2.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #107:1>
Apply and release the footbrake several times .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #108:1>
3.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #109:1>
Slacken the locknut at the rear of the handbrake lever between the two cables ( B , Fig. A:36 ) , then turn the adjuster nut ( A ) until a distance of 5 mm is obtained between each handbrake cable nipple and the caliper calliper lever ( x , Fig. A:37 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #110:1>
Move each caliper calliper lever by hand to check that each returns freely to its stop .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #111:1>
4.
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #112:1>
Tighten the handbrake adjuster locknut and refit the lever trim , filler cap release handle and seat in the reverse order of removal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #113:1>
Hoses , Pipes &ampersand; Seals
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #114:1>
A visual check of flexible hoses and all rigid brake pipes should be carried out at every 12,000 miles or 12 monthly service , also every time that the car is off the ground for any reason .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #115:1>
Look for leaks , damage , chafing and corrosion .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #116:1>
Flexible hoses can be gently twisted and examined for cracking , while rigid pipes should be carefully examined for any corrosion severe enough to cause pitting and weakness .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #117:1>
For further information refer to PASS THE MoT .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #118:1>
Any component which is suspect should be changed immediately .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #119:1>
Rear Brake Pads ( 1.9 GTi )
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #120:1>
Slacken the rear wheel bolts , raise and support the rear of the car - see Raising &ampersand; Supporting The Car under SAFETY PROCEDURES and remove the rear wheels .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #121:1>
The thickness of the pads can be checked by looking into the end of the brake caliper calliper ( Fig. A:35 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #122:1>
Measure the distance between the face of the pad backing plate and the contact face ( &lsquo; x &rsquo; , Fig. A:35 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #123:1>
When this distance is reduced to , or approaching 2 mm ( 5/64 in ) or less , the pads must be replaced .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #124:1>
As preventative maintenance , all fluid seals should be regularly inspected and replaced if necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #125:1>
Because the seals in the wheel and master cylinders are designed to work with brake fluid as a lubricant , a small seepage past the seal into the protective boot is expected .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #126:1>
However , the amount of fluid at this point should be minimal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #127:1>
A drain hole is provided in the master cylinder boot from which a minimal seepage is acceptable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #128:1>
If any seal is found to be leaking a large amount of fluid , all of the seals should be replaced as a safety measure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #129:1>
The procedures for replacing the brake seals in the various hydraulic components are fully described under the appropriate headings in BRAKES .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #130:1>
WHEELS &ampersand; TYRES &dotted-line; [ 16 ]
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #131:1>
Tyre Pressures
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #132:1>
The tyres should be checked and adjusted to the recommended pressures where necessary at least once a week .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #133:1>
Check the pressures when the tyres are cold as tyre pressures may increase by as much as 0.4 bar ( 6 lb/in 2 when hot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #134:1>
The spare tyre should be set at the highest of the specified pressures and adjusted , if necessary , after fitting .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #135:1>
Incorrect inflation pressures will cause abnormal tyre wear and may result in premature failure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #136:1>
There is an average loss of 13% tread mileage for every 10% reduction in inflation pressure below the recommended figure .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #137:1>
When checking pressure ensure that the dust caps are refitted to the valves as , apart from keeping out dirt , they also provide a second seal to the valve .
<ICE-GB:W2D-018 #138:1>
The tightness of the wheel securing bolts should be checked at the same time as the tyre pressures .

EASTERN DESIGNS
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #2:1>
Origami is the Japanese word for &lsquo; paper-folding &rsquo; and is used around the world as a tribute to the original home of the art , some 1500 years ago .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #3:1>
The best contemporary designs reveal qualities typical of oriental arts and crafts - elegance , stylization and , in de<l>signs of living creatures , more regard for character than for form .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #4:1>
The wide range of beautiful papers ( the country is renowned for its papers ) often means that more attention is given to the look of a design than to its sequence of folds , so that the artistry lies more in the relationships between the paper , the subject and the manipulative finesse of the folder , than in the ballet of the sequence .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #5:1>
These designs - particularly those of living creatures by the greatest of origami masters , Akira Yoshizawa - are uncannily alive , but are almost unreproduceable by we lesser folders who do not have &lsquo; the spirit &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #6:1>
Fortunately , though , for books such as this , there is a large body of work that can be repro<l>duced by the lay folder in conventional papers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #7:1>
In recent years , a less emotive , more geometric style of folding has emerged , drawing not a little inspiration from the technological advances made in the West since the 1950s .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #8:1>
The Cube and Stretch Wall are examples of this style .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #9:1>
Outside Japan , there are known to be creative folders in Hong Kong , Singapore and Malaysia .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #10:1>
YOSHIZAWA 'S BUTTERFLIES
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #11:1>
Akira Yoshizawa is the single most important paper-folder in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #12:1>
He was born in 1911 , at a time when origami meant little more to the Japanese than the mechanical reproduction of a few traditional designs , and when creative origami was virtually unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #13:1>
As with many children , origami became an absorbing hobby of his .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #14:1>
Unlike other children though , it later became such an obsession that at the age of 26 he left his job in an iron foundry ( where he had usefully learnt the principles of geometry ) to devote himself to origami .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #15:1>
For a decade he worked alone and in poverty , inventing many new designs and forging his philosophy of creative origami .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #16:1>
Shortly before World War II , a twist of fate brought him much publicity and an influential patron to guide him on his professional career .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #17:1>
After the war , Yoshizawa resumed his career , publishing his first book in 1952 , establishing the International Origami Center in 1954 and first exhibiting in Europe in 1955 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #18:1>
Since then , he has received many cultural honours and travelled widely , including several visits to the West where origami enthusiasts have acclaimed his work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #19:1>
Yoshizawa separates origami into two kinds : &lsquo; recreational &rsquo; and &lsquo; art &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #20:1>
The former he largely dismisses as being the mechanical repro<l>duction of a design to give an illustrative likeness of a subject , but without expression or character .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #21:1>
Such designs include all traditional and geometric work and almost all other modern creative work , from East or West .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #22:1>
To Yoshizawa , these designs may be clever , but they are without spirit .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #23:1>
He advocates an origami which reveals the inner character of the subject through the interpretive skills of the paper<l->folder .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #24:1>
Mere symbolic representation is not enough :
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #25:1>
the folder must have an empathy for the subject he is folding and the material he uses ( the paper ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #26:1>
If this suggests a philosophy that is too all-embracing and too emotional to be practised by the reader who wishes his origami to simply be an enjoyable pastime , then it is a measure of Yoshizawa 's complete commitment to his art .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #27:1>
However total or controversial Yoshizawa 's approach may be , there can be no doubting the quality of his work , the range and diversity of which is legendary .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #28:1>
In particular , his finesse with paper is without equal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #29:1>
It is so exquisite as to defy reproduction by any other folder .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #30:1>
Diagrams can only show the bare bones of a design , which the folder through dedicated practice must flesh out and bring to life .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #31:1>
The butterflies photographed here ( which have all been folded by Yoshizawa and generously donated for use in the book ) show a good cross-section of his work , from the very simple to the very complex , but all beautifully folded .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #32:1>
The simpler ones can be folded by anybody , even young children .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #33:1>
Although they are examples of the &lsquo; recreational &rsquo; style which he does not usually support , they can be made to flutter when the central ridge is depressed , bringing them to life and so earning them a place in his renowned and charismatic teaching performances .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #34:1>
The more complex ones show his engineering prowess .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #35:1>
Were this a Yoshizawa book , the designs would be yet more beautiful , but western writers are not usually permitted to publish the very best of his work .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #36:1>
Indeed , visitors to his home-cum-studio in Tokyo say that the most extraordinary of his pieces remain unpublished .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #37:1>
It is possible to conceive that a modern origami movement would have evolved without Yoshizawa , but his genius has enriched the art for all time .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #38:1>
YOSHIZAWA 'S BUTTERFLY
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #39:1>
Here are the instructions for Yoshizawa 's best-known Butterfly , drawn by the creator for use in the book and reproduced with<l>out alterations or additions .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #40:1>
This butterfly is the logo of the International Origami Center , which Yoshizawa founded to help spread friendship and peace through origami .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #41:1>
The design is so well-known that it has almost become traditional .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #42:1>
Yoshizawa does not give the written step by step instructions as we have done in other designs , but by now the reader should be familiar enough with the diagrams and symbols to be able to follow his instructions .

MOUNT FUJI AND THE SEA
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #45:1>
The late creator of this design , Seiryo Takegawa ( Japan ) , special<l>ized in producing very simple designs for children , including many wonderful action toys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #46:1>
This little-known masterpiece is typical of his work : simple , poetic , audacious and charming .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #47:1>
Perhaps it is like the traditional Bird on page 16 - more a symbol than a representation .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #48:1>
Use a 6-8in ( 15-20cm ) square .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #49:1>
Origami paper is ideal .

Mountain fold the top corners behind , so that the vertical edges are brought down level with the horizontal fold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #57:1>
4
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #58:1>
Divide the lower section into quarters .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #59:1>
All the creases must be valleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #60:1>
5
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #61:1>
Place mountains between the valleys .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #62:1>
Pleat the creases , including the original horizontal fold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #63:1>

Mount Fuji and the Sea complete .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #65:1>
YACHT
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #66:1>
There are many origami yachts , boats and ships , but none are as simple or as full of movement as this wonderful design by Japan 's First Lady of origami , Mrs Toshie Takahama .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #67:1>
Mrs Takahama has pro<l>duced many exquisite designs , particularly of animals ( see her Cat on page 40 ) and flowers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #68:1>
She has written several books , some of which have recently been translated into English .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #69:1>
Use a 6-8in ( 15-20cm ) square of origami paper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #70:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #82:1>
ETERNALLY OPENING ORIGAMI
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #83:1>
This design is Step 13 of the Flapping Bird ( see page 22 ) turned upside down .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #84:1>
It is nothing more than the classic Bird Base , familiar to all experienced folders .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #85:1>
What makes it remarkable is that no one until Takuji Sugimura of Japan realized that it could perform the addictive dance described here .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #86:1>
The lesson , of course , is never to disregard the familiar in case it holds a wonderful secret .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #87:1>
Use a 6-8in ( 15-20cm ) square of paper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #88:1>
1
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #89:1>
Hold points A and B .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #90:1>
Separate your hands , moving them outwards and downwards , allowing C and D to rise ... 2 ... like this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #91:1>
Begin to bring A and B back together below C and D ... 3 ... like this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #92:1>
Continue until A and B are together at the bottom .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #93:1>
4
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #94:1>
The movement complete .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #95:1>
Strengthen the creases .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #96:1>
5
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #97:1>
Transfer your hands to C and D and repeat Steps 1-4 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #98:1>
6
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #99:1>
Transfer your hands back to A and B and repeat and repeat and repeat !
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #100:1>
Be careful at Step 2 not to pull A and B too far apart , or the paper will &lsquo; snap &rsquo; and lock to look like Step 2 of the Daffodil stem on page 64 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #101:1>
CUBE
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #102:1>
The creator of the Cube , Shuzo Fujimoto ( Japan ) has conducted a great deal of research into the geometry of folding , including important discoveries about how to fold accurate polygons ( penta<l>gons , hexagons , and so on ) from a square &semi; how to divide an edge into accurate thirds , fifths , etc without &lsquo; guesstimating &rsquo; &semi; and how to fold a one-inch solid such as a tetrahedron or an icosahedron .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #103:1>
If all this sounds rather dry ( it isn't ! ) , just enjoy folding his Cube .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #104:1>
In parti<l>cular , enjoy Step 5 - surely one of the &lsquo; best moves &rsquo; in all origami .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #105:1>
Use a 6-8in ( 15-20cm ) square of thin or medium weight paper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #106:1>
1
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #107:1>
Carefully divide the paper into quarters , horizontally and vertically , to create 16 squares .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #108:1>
2
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #109:1>
Re-crease the creases to look like the pattern of mountains and valleys shown here .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #110:1>
3
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #111:1>
Add eight short diagonals .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #112:1>
Be precise .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #113:1>
4
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #114:1>
Fold in half .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #115:1>
Note squares A and B .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #116:1>
5
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #117:1>
Hold as shown .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #118:1>
Note square A at the front and B behind .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #119:1>
The aim is now to slide A up and to the left so that it exactly covers B .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #120:1>
When this has happened , the paper will have curled into a cube form .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #121:1>
All of the marked creases must form cleanly and simultaneously .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #122:1>
There is a knack to this &lsquo; slide &rsquo; , so please try it several times .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #123:1>
6
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #124:1>
Tuck the front square inside to lock the top .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #125:1>
7
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #126:1>
Turn over .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #127:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #136:1>
The Cube complete .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #137:1>
CAT
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #138:1>
This is another design by Mrs Toshie Takahama ( see also her Yacht on page 36 ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #139:1>
The cat is regarded by many creative folders to be a very difficult subject to capture in paper , because its shape is very simple and curved .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #140:1>
In the opinion of the author , Mrs Takahama 's Cat is the most successful version yet achieved , being well propor<l>tioned , full of character , instantly recognizeable and pleasing to fold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #141:1>
The design benefite benefits from being made from a textured paper such as Ingres ( Strathmore ) , or another appropriate paper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #142:1>
Begin with Step 3 of the Bird ( see page 16 ) , using a 6-8in ( 15-20cm ) square of paper as in that design .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #143:1>
1
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #144:1>
Fold the short edges to the centre .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #145:1>
2
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #146:1>
Narrow the corner at the right .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #147:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #148:1>
3
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #149:1>
Fold in half .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #150:1>
Note A and B .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #151:1>
4

Reverse the blunt corner along AB , then ... 5 ... reverse it back up level with open edge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #153:1>
Reverse the sharp corner to the position shown in Step 6 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #154:1>
6
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #155:1>
Valley the front layer at the left across to the right , so that the point stands upright .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #156:1>
Turn the sharp point inside out .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #157:1>
7
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #158:1>
Squash the point , dot to dot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #159:1>
Reverse the tail .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #160:1>
8
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #161:1>
Tuck the point inside the face , folding dot to dot .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #162:1>
Reverse the tail .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #163:1>
9
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #164:1>
Fold the ears forward .

INCENSE BURNER
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #175:1>
The Reverend Philip Shen ( Hong Kong ) specializes in creating geometric designs which collapse into shape from a carefully laid out pattern of pre-creases .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #176:1>
The Incense Burner is one of his finest designs , particularly because the final shape is conjoured from a very familiar pattern of pre-creases -
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #177:1>
the kite shape in Step 2 is known to all paper-folders , yet simply to repeat it on each corner and add the central star shape is enough to create a beautiful design .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #178:1>
Use a 6-10 ( 15-20cm ) square of medium weight paper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #179:1>
1
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #180:1>
Fold the two edges meeting at A to the centre crease .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #181:1>
2
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #182:1>
Unfold .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #183:1>
3
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #184:1>
Repeat with the other two edges meeting at C .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #185:1>
4
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #186:1>
Repeat with the two edges meeting at B , then those meeting at D .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #187:1>
5
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #188:1>
Fold A to E , E being at the end of the upper crease made in Step 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #189:1>
Crease only where shown .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #190:1>
6 Repeat , folding A to F , F being at the end of the lower crease made in Step 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #191:1>
7
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #192:1>
Repeat with B C and D , making 6 more short creases .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #193:1>
8
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #194:1>
Re-crease the octagon with mountain creases .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #195:1>
9
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #196:1>
Fold in the creases as shown .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #197:1>
10 Reverse A along existing creases ...
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #198:1>
11 ... like this .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #199:1>
Turn over .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #200:1>
12 Strengthen the inner star shape with mountain creases .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #201:1>
Turn back over and repeat Steps 9-11 with B C and D , forming three more legs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #202:1>

<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #203:1>
TULIP AND STEM
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #204:1>
Here is the first two-piece design in the book and one of the simplest and most appealing of all origami flowers .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #205:1>
Its creator , Kunihiko Kasahara ( Japan ) , has written over 100 origami books - including some in English - which feature his own prolific output .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #206:1>
To make the Tulip and Stem , make the Tulip square half the size of the Stem square , so that ( for example ) if the Tulip is made from a 4in ( 10cm ) square , the Stem is made from an 8in ( 20cm ) square .
<ICE-GB:W2D-019 #207:1>
The Tulip begins with Step 6 of the Flapping Bird ( see page 22 ) turned upside down and the Stem begins with Step 3 of the Bird ( see page 16 ) .

Marvellous Ways with Mince
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #2:1>
STEAK TARTARE
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #3:1>
The very description of steak tartare , raw minced beef with raw egg mixed into it , eaten as it stands , is not everybody 's idea of a tasty meal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #4:1>
But it 's not a coincidence that this unusual dish , named after the central Asian nomads who were supposed to have developed it , has remained a firm favourite on gour<l>met menus throughout the world .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #5:1>
You have to try it before you knock it , and once you try it you 'll prob<l>ably love it , as I certainly do .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #6:1>
The taste is delicate not rough , and you can almost feel it filling you with zest and vigour .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #7:1>
One word of warning :
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #8:1>
it 's remarkably filling , so don't be tempted to serve larger portions than I suggested .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #9:1>
Attachment double-bladed knife
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #10:1>
Ingredients 1 lb ( 450g ) rump or sirloin steak 1 onion 1 gherkin 4 teaspoons chopped parsley ( done in the processor ) 1 level teaspoon each , grainy French mustard , lemon juice , Worcester sauce , oil 1 whole egg 4 egg yolks salt freshly ground black pepper 4 drops tabasco
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #11:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #12:1>
Put the whole egg , all the seasonings and vegetables into the bowl and process for 10 seconds until smoothly pur&eacute;ed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #13:1>
Add the meat , cut into neat cubes with the fat and gristle removed , and process for another 10-15 seconds until thoroughly blended , but not chopped too fine -
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #14:1>
a little texture is important here .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #15:1>
Remove and pat into a smooth giant ham<l>burger shape on the serving dish .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #16:1>
When you separate the 4 eggs , keep the yolks in a half shell , and nestle the half shells around the giant hamburger shape .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #17:1>
You can , if you like , add some anchovy in a pattern between the eggs .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #18:1>
Serve it as it stands for each diner to mix an egg yolk into his or her own meat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #19:1>
Crisp salad and a baked potato on a side plate are my favourite accompaniments .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #20:1>
Do try it -
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #21:1>
it may even make you feel a little nomadic yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #22:1>
HAMBURGERS
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #23:1>
I make no apology for including this recipe for ham<l>burgers because the texture and juiciness of the meat when minced properly makes this common dish a revelation .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #24:1>
Don't be tempted to add any other ingredients &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #25:1>
the basic flavour of the beef comes through far better if not too heavily disguised .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #26:1>
Attachment double-bladed knife
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #27:1>
Ingredients
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #28:1>
1 1/4 lb ( 550g ) chuck steak 1 small or 1/2 large onion 1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon each , salt and freshly ground black pepper oil for frying
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #29:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #30:1>
Cut the meat into even-sized cubes , leaving on any fat but removing all gristle .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #31:1>
Process for 10 seconds , scrape down the sides &semi; flash the motor on and off again to make sure it 's all thoroughly evenly cut , then turn into a separate bowl .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #32:1>
Add the onion and egg yolk to the bowl and process until pur&eacute;ed , add to the meat with the salt and pepper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #33:1>
Mix all the ingre<l>dients thoroughly together , divide into 4 and shape into 1 inch thick patties with smooth , round sides .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #34:1>
Let these stand , if you can , in the fridge for a few minutes , and then barbecue them or fry them in a minimum of oil in a thick bottomed frying pan .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #35:1>
If you like them rare , a minute on each side on high and then 5 minutes over a low flame will do it &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #36:1>
if you like them a little bit better done , a minute on each side on high and 7 to 8 minutes on low is about right .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #37:1>
You can eat them in buns , with the traditional gherkins , tomato sauce , mustard and relishes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #38:1>
CAMBRIDGE STEAK
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #39:1>
Add a little lemon juice and Worcester sauce to the juices in the pan and serve the patties as a dish in their own right with potatoes and vegetables , pour<l>ing the sauce over them .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #40:1>
Hamburgers served like this are called a variety of names , some grand and some humble , but Cambridge Steak is the one I 've heard used the most .

PARTY HAMBURGERS
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #43:1>
Attachment double-bladed knife
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #44:1>
Ingredients ( for 12 hamburgers )
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #45:1>
4 thick slices of bread 2 large onions 1 1/2 lb ( 675g ) chuck steak 6 fl oz ( 1 breakfast cup ) water 6 tablespoons tomato ketchup 1 tablespoon Worcester sauce
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #46:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #47:1>
Make breadcrumbs with the bread cut into 1 inch chunks in the processor , tip out and add the meat cut into 1 inch cubes with any gristle or hard bits carefully removed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #48:1>
Mince the meat so that it is still coarsely minced , add the onions , peeled , quartered and cut into 1/2 inch slices .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #49:1>
Process for 10 seconds until they are mixed with the meat .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #50:1>
Add the bread<l>crumbs and all the other ingredients and process in 3 bursts of 5 seconds until thoroughly mixed .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #51:1>
Season generously .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #52:1>
Test for texture -
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #53:1>
the mixture should be firm but pliable .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #54:1>
Chill for 1/2 an hour in the fridge before shaping into 12 patties for grilling , frying or oven baking at a high temperature 400 &degree;F , 200 &degree;C , gas mark 6 .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #55:1>
They can be frozen after they 're made if you started with fresh meat in the first place .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #56:1>
They shouldn't be kept for more than a month , however , at normal domestic freezer temperatures .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #57:1>
LAMB BURGERS
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #58:1>
This variation uses lamb instead of beef , a useful alternative in the light of recent uncertainties .

Lamb can be fatty when you buy it so make sure you trim off any obvious and excessive chunks of fat before putting the meat in for mincing .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #60:1>
If you can find some of the older lamb , hoggit hogget or even mutton which is sometimes available these days , it also makes won<l>derful burgers .

LAMB KEBABS
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #72:1>
This dish is from the Middle East , though variations are to be found from Morocco to Afghanistan .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #73:1>
They can be difficult to make in the traditional way -
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #74:1>
how<l>ever , a food processor makes things very simple .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #75:1>
These unusual minced kebabs are delicious served either as an Eastern sandwich inside Greek pitta-type bread or an Indian chappati &semi; or as a main dish on a plate with rice or fried potatoes , which are so dear to the Turks ' hearts .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #76:1>
Don't be afraid to ex<l>periment with other flavourings and herbs if you fancy a bit more of a culinary cook 's tour .

Attachments double-bladed knife
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #78:1>
Ingredients
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #79:1>
1 lb ( 450g ) boneless lean lamb or mutton 1 tablespoon rice flour ( or ground rice ) 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon Worcester sauce 1 teaspoon curry powder 1 teaspoon garlic salt 1 peeled onion salt and pepper
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #80:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #81:1>
Cut the lamb into cubes and put it into the bowl with all the other ingredients .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #82:1>
Process for 20 seconds , scrape down the sides and process again until the mixture is really smooth .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #83:1>
This is traditionally done with a pestle and mortar and takes at least an hour to get the necessary smooth consistency .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #84:1>
When finished , shape into rolls , about 4-5 inches long and 1 inch thick and put these , if there is time , in the fridge to chill for 1/4 hour .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #85:1>
Thread each one separately onto a skewer , and grill under a preheated grill or barbecue for 5 minutes each side .

CHILLI CON CARN&Eacute;
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #87:1>
This is almost regarded as the national dish of Mexico , although its real origins are rather further north , and it has at least as much Texas as Mexico in its parentage .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #88:1>
Nevertheless , it 's another of those mar<l>vellously exotic and economical dishes which can be served either as a family supper or for a grander occasion .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #89:1>
It 's best served with rice to which you 've added for the last 5 minutes of cooking a packet of frozen sweetcorn ( thus saving on washing-up as well ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #90:1>
In California , where Mexican food is a new<l->found fashion , they sometimes serve it with a separate bowl of sour cream which is unusual , but , like so many things Californian , quite nice when you try it .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #91:1>
It is important in this recipe not to over-mince the meat , because a certain &lsquo; bitey &rsquo; texture is quite important to the finished dish .

Attachment double-bladed knife
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #93:1>
Ingredients
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #94:1>
1 lb ( 450g ) chuck steak 2 tablespoons oil 8 oz ( 225g ) onions 1 teaspoon each , cinnamon , ground cumin , paprika and pinch of cayenne pepper or 1-2 teaspoons chilli powder 1 x 16 oz ( 450g ) tin tomatoes 1 x 16 oz ( 450g ) tin red kidney beans ( baked beans won't do for this one ) salt and pepper
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #95:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #96:1>
Cut the meat into 1-1 1/2 inch cubes and process lightly for 2 or 3 seconds , until the meat is minced but still in discernible pieces ( this is really a stew , not a kind of soup ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #97:1>
Fry the mince in a big pan in a couple of tablespoons of oil until it 's well browned .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #98:1>
Put the onions into the bowl and chop finely , and add the tin of tomatoes through the feed-tube with the motor running .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #99:1>
Stir the spices into the meat , and season with salt and pepper .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #100:1>
You can add a tea<l>spoon of oregano at this stage ( it 's very much an optional extra , even in Mexico ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #101:1>
Add the tomato and onion mixture then bring to the boil before adding the contents of the tin of beans .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #102:1>
Turn the heat down to low &semi; cover and simmer gently for at least half an hour .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #103:1>
The longer this dish cooks the better it tastes , and an hour is ideal .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #104:1>
It will turn a dark rich red and the beans will absorb the flavour of both the meat and the herbs .

<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #106:1>
This is one of the dishes which came about when Italian immigrants to New York earlier this century married the cooking of their homeland with the abundance of their adopted country .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #107:1>
The result was good , country-style fare , rich in flavour and ingredients .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #108:1>
Don't be tempted to spare the garlic - and don't expect to take violent exercise afterwards .

Ingredients
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #111:1>
1 lb ( 450g ) chuck steak 2 slices wholemeal bread 1 onion 1 teaspoon oregano 1 egg 2 cloves garlic
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #112:1>
For the sauce 1 onion 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons Worcester sauce 1 teaspoon each , basil and thyme 1 large tin Italian tomatoes 3-4 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 lb ( 450g ) Italian spaghetti salt and pepper
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #113:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #114:1>
Cut the meat into small cubes and break the bread into chunks .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #115:1>
Peel the onion and garlic cloves .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #116:1>
Pro<l>cess the meat until medium-coarse ( about 7-8 seconds ) then add the bread , one onion , 2 cloves of garlic , the oregano and the egg and for 5-7 seconds or until well mixed &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #117:1>
form into 1 inch 1-1/2 inch meatballs and fry until lightly browned in 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #118:1>
Add the second onion and remaining garlic to the bowl , process until pur&eacute;ed then with the motor running add the tomatoes , the remaining herbs , the sugar , the Worcester sauce and the lemon juice and seasonings and process briefly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #119:1>
Melt the butter and the remaining oil in a separate saucepan
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #120:1>
&semi; add the tomato mixture , and cook , stir<l>ring regularly for at least 10 minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #121:1>
An extra 15 minutes partially covered with a lid and on a low heat improves the flavour remarkably , as does a bay leaf if you have one .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #122:1>
Add the meatballs to the tomato sauce , partially cover the pan , and simmer for another 15 minutes while cooking the spaghetti .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #123:1>
When cooked arrange the spaghetti in a big ring on a large plate and pour the meatball and tomato sauce mixture into the middle .

This variation on the meatball theme was originally made with veal , but both in America and in this country veal can be hard to come by and turkey breast makes a surprisingly satisfactory substitute .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #127:1>
This dish was originally made to eat with Polenta , the Italian cornbread that comes from the Po valley region and is still popular in parts of Little Italy in New York .

Ingredients
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #131:1>
11/2 lb ( 675g ) leeks 1 lb ( 450g ) turkey fillet or leg meat ( boneless ) a slice of bread in 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) cubes 1 clove garlic 1 egg 8 oz ( 225g ) Italian tinned tomatoes rind and juice of lemon 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon each of basil , oregano and 1/2 teaspoon rosemary salt and pepper
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #132:1>
Method
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #133:1>
Trim and wash the leeks extremely thoroughly to remove any sand or dirt .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #134:1>
Fit the slicing disc to the processor and slice them thinly .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #135:1>
Set aside and change the blades so that you now have the double-bladed knife in the processor .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #136:1>
Cut the turkey into 1 inch cubes and put it , with the cubed bread , the peeled and trimmed clove of garlic , the rind of the lemon , the rosemary and the egg into the bowl .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #137:1>
Pro<l>cess until the mixture has formed a smooth pur&eacute;e .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #138:1>
Scrape down the sides and process 5 seconds more .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #139:1>
Clean out and chill for 20 minutes in the fridge .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #140:1>
Meanwhile fry the sliced leeks in 2 tablespoons of olive oil until they 've softened .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #141:1>
Add the tomatoes and their juice , the lemon juice , the oregano and basil , mix thoroughly and cook gently for 10 minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #142:1>
Shape the turkey mixture into 1 inch meat<l>balls ( you may find wetted hands useful for this exercise ) .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #143:1>
Fry them lightly in a frying pan in a little oil until just browned and firm and add to the leek and tomato mixture .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #144:1>
Put on a very low heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2D-020 #145:1>
Check for seasoning and serve with plenty of freshly ground black pepper on 1 lb ( 450g ) of tagliatelle cooked as per instructions and moistened with a little butter before adding the turkey meatballs .

The purpose of the war
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #2:1>
IN BRITAIN and in the United States , opinion among the decision-makers is moving towards a hardening of the allies ' war aims .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #3:1>
Two factors have influenced this change of stance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #4:1>
First , it is now becoming apparent that Saddam Hussein 's military machine is considerably stronger and more dan<l>gerous than had at first been expected .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #5:1>
Throughout the past decade , he has been buying armaments and fortifications from Western countries eager both to see him defeat the fundamentalists in Iran and to take his cash .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #6:1>
They foolishly overlooked his con<l>sistently abysmal record on human rights , on the naive principle that &ldquo; the enemy of my enemy is my friend &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #7:1>
Now Saddam Hussein has become the ene<l>my , and the Western nations now facing him are the very nations which supplied him with the means to inflict upon them the heavy casualties which are to be expected when the war on the ground begins .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #8:1>
Secondly , the behaviour of Iraq since the war be<l>gan has been so far beyond the bounds of rationality or humanity that it would be irresponsible to allow Saddam Hussein 's military machine to remain in existence once it has been evicted from its unlawful tenancy of Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #9:1>
Iraq , having brought the war upon herself by failing to comply with the resolu<l>tions of the United Nations calling upon her to withdraw from Kuwait , has declined to fight the allies but has decided instead to commit numerous acts of international terrorism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #10:1>
First , Iraq launched inaccurate Soviet-made missiles at centres of civil<l>ian population both in Saudi Arabia and in Israel , a non-combatant nation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #11:1>
Now the oil stopcocks in the Kuwaiti oilfields have been opened , so that millions of barrels of crude oil have poured into the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #12:1>
The spillage is certain to cause immense environmental damage .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #13:1>
Environmentalist groups , more moved by the sight of oil-covered cormorants than by the memory of the millions of human beings whom Saddam Hussein 's tyranny has already slaughtered , have called for an immediate cease-fire .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #14:1>
The allies , however , rightly regard Iraq 's wholly unprincipled act of environmental terrorism as further justification - if it were needed - not merely for pursuing the conflict until Kuwait is free but also for eradicating once and for all the military machine which has so destabilised an already volatile region throughout the past decade .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #15:1>
TOM KING , the British Defence Secretary , hint<l>ing that the war aims should be extended , has ingeniously prayed in aid the last line of UN Resolution 678 , which empowers the allies &ldquo; to re<l>store peace and stability to the area &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #16:1>
There can be no peace and no stability while Saddam Hussein 's armed forces remain capable of fighting .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #17:1>
Near-total demobilisation of Iraq , leaving only a modest de<l>fence force , is an entirely legitimate objective .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #18:1>
The Labour party , however , is already adither over the desirability of complying as fully as Mr King sug<l>gests with Resolution 678 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #19:1>
Several members of the Labour front bench ( many of whom were perhaps only willing to go along with the war in the first place because they appreciated the electoral cost of appeasement ) are objecting to any extension of the allies ' war aims .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #20:1>
The Prime Minister will , no doubt , face ques<l>tions in the House this week about the desirability of extending the war aims to include the demobili<l>sation of Saddam Hussein 's military machine in Iraq as well as in Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #21:1>
His gentle , unemotional and statesmanlike handling of the conflict has earned him a popularity rating in the opinion polls higher than that of any leader since Churchill .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #22:1>
He will , no doubt , make the obvious point that the al<l>lies , to achieve the objective of removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait , are already doing as much damage as they can to military installations in Iraq with their aerial bombardments .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #23:1>
He will also say that it is impossible at this stage to predict the outcome of any peace negotiations once Kuwait has been restored to its rightful government .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #24:1>
But it is now clear that no standing army as large , as well<l->equipped and as plainly offensive as that of Iraq can be allowed to remain in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #25:1>
The purpose of the war must be both to set Kuwait free and to ensure that the freedom of all countries in the re<l>gion can never again be threatened by the mon<l>strous army of Saddam Hussein .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #26:2>
Belittling Europe
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #27:2>
FEDERASTS and Europhiliacs address the Eu<l>ropean question in crude and dangerously simplistic terms when they present the issue as one of Margaret Thatcher 's personality or talk of Britain missing the bus or the boat or the train .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #28:2>
The Prime Minister 's strong reservations about M Delors ' proposals for economic and monetary union are fully justified and deserve to be taken seriously .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #29:2>
The Delors plan entails replacing Parliamentary control of monetary policy with an unelected com<l>mittee of central bankers &semi; it utterly fails to address the central question of how to prevent the ecu from inflating , without which economic and monetary union would be gross foolishness &semi; it envisages laying down a timetable without laying down what , pre<l>cisely , is to be done within that timetable &semi; and the peoples of Europe are not to be formally consulted at any point , by referendum or otherwise .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #30:2>
Those who are using the European debate merely as a vent for their dislike of the Prime Minister are doing the nation a grievous disservice : there are vital consti<l>tutional and practical issues to be examined in detail , and Mrs Thatcher should not be left to do the work in isolation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #31:2>
On one such matter of detail , the Prime Minister has been very much less clear than is her custom .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #32:2>
On the one hand , she said in her statement yesterday that the hard ecu which the Treasury has suggested as a low-inflation currency competing with each of the existing high-inflation currencies of Europe could eventually drive out the others and become Europe 's sole currency .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #33:2>
On the other hand , she said she thought that few Britons would choose the hard ecu rather than the pound .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #34:2>
If the hard ecu inflated at a rate lower than that of any European currency , or , better still , if it did not inflate at all , only the foolish would prefer to be paid or to save in pounds or francs or even German marks .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #35:2>
Rightly , the Government 's policy is that the pound shall not be taken from our pockets against the will of the people .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #36:2>
But the Gov<l>ernment , including the Prime Minister , should be entirely willing to accept that its own proposed hard ecu , which addresses the problem of inflation while the Delors plan does not , might well prove so popular that economic and monetary union would come about within a very much shorter time than M Delors himself expects .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #37:3>
Challenge to tyranny
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #38:3>
SADDAM HUSSEIN must by now be bitterly regretting the gamble he took with the lives of his citizens and the future of his nation when he moved his forces into the sovereign territory of Kuwait and announced that it would henceforth be part of Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #39:3>
The recent experience of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and of Argentina in the Falkland Islands ought to have warned him that the lessons of appeasement have been well learned by the nations of the West :
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #40:3>
no longer are we prepared to kow-tow to tyrants in the hope that they will invade someone else 's country and leave us alone .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #41:3>
Indeed , Saddam Hussein ought to have learned from his own experience in the pointless and futile war against Iran , which he initiated and which profited him nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #42:3>
Not a single inch of Iranian territory did he gain then .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #43:3>
Not a single inch of Kuwaiti territory will he be allowed to retain now .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #44:3>
It may be that Saddam Hussein had intended to strike at the oilfields of Saudi Arabia 's eastern al<l->Hasa region , containing the oil cities of Hofuf and Dhahran .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #45:3>
Had the timely arrival of US and British forces not prevented this manoeuvre , some 5 mil<l>lion barrels a day of oil production might have been put at risk .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #46:3>
The Yemen might have joined battle to recapture the Saudi provinces of Jaizan , Asir and Najran , which Ibn Saud took when building what is now Saudi Arabia .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #47:3>
Jordan , too , which maintains close military and political links with Iraq , might have used her strong army to take Hijaz , the Saudi region in which the holy cities of Medina and Mecca stand .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #48:3>
The swift response of the West prevented what might have been a concerted move by Saudi Arabia 's neighbours to dismember her .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #49:3>
Now that the deadline for withdrawal has ex<l>pired , Saddam Hussein 's only responsible and prudent course ( if he remains capable of respon<l>sibility and prudence ) is to sue at once for peace .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #50:3>
His troops are battle-hardened after the long conflict against Iran , and they are well equipped with military hardware from their erstwhile friends in the Soviet Union and their strange trading partners in South Africa .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #51:3>
Yet they cannot match the strength and sheer firepower of the 500,000-strong interna<l>tional defence force ranged against them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #52:3>
Their chemical and biological weapons may yet prove a two-edged sword , and they know that if they deploy them they may face nuclear retaliation in the bat<l>tlefield .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #53:3>
THE family clique round Saddam Hussein - including his half-brother and chief adviser , Ibrahim Sibawi , and his son-in-law and commander-in-chief , General Hussein Kamal - should delay no longer before agreeing to with<l>draw their forces to Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #54:3>
Otherwise , Saddam Hussein will find that his unprovoked aggression in invading Kuwait will be held heavily against him .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #55:3>
If he fails to concede and withdraw , the blood of countless thousands on both sides will be on his hands , though the high price in human lives ( in the light of the Iran-Iraq war ) is a consid<l>eration to which one such as he can scarcely be expected to devote much thought .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #56:3>
If the Iraqis fight , they will ultimately be over<l>thrown .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #57:3>
What form of government will then re<l>place Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #58:3>
If the United States and Britain have any say in the matter , a proper democracy - the first in the Arab world - should be put in place in Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #59:3>
Once de<l>mocracy is firmly planted in Baghdad , the seeds of freedom may well be carried to neighbouring countries , not excluding Kuwait , which have for too long been dominated either by exceedingly rich families accountable to no one but them<l>selves or , as in Iran and in too many Arab coun<l>tries , by crazed terrorists whose brutal treatment of their populations has long extinguished what little popularity they may once have enjoyed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #60:3>
Ay<l>atollah Khomeini , for instance , often killed as many of his own citizens in a single day as the Shah had killed in his entire reign .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #61:3>
In the long term , it is the replacement of Arab dictatorships by democracies that will be the best guarantee of freedom , stability and peace in the Middle East .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #62:3>
Let Iraq be the first .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #63:4>
A doomed dictator
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #64:4>
SADDAM HUSSEIN is making the grave strate<l>gic and political error of fighting a dirty war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #65:4>
His shameful attacks on centres of civilian popula<l>tion using inaccurate , outdated and mercifully in<l>effective Soviet missiles have had two effects wholly contrary to his intention :
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #66:4>
they have united the world in sympathy and admiration for Israel , which has nobly refrained from exercising the legitimate right of retaliation in self-defence &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #67:4>
and they have strengthened the resolve of the allied forces to drive him out of Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #68:4>
In particular , the Arab members of the alliance have stood firm , and Syria has de<l>clared that she would not change sides even if Israel were to retaliate against Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #69:4>
Even among the more fanatical elements in the world of Islam , the reali<l>sation is dawning that Saddam Hussein , far from being a hero , is a monstrous liability .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #70:4>
As Tom King , the British Defence Secretary , pointed out during his public briefing yesterday , Saddam Hussein has now killed more Moslems than anyone else in history .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #71:4>
He committed his first mur<l>der personally when he was still a child , and he has been killing his fellow-Arabs on an appalling scale ever since .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #72:4>
He attempted the genocide of the Kurdish people &semi; he killed millions of his own countrymen and of his Iranian neighbours in the Iran/Iraq war , which was entirely of his own making &semi; he has mur<l>dered thousands of civilians in Kuwait &semi; and he is now dropping his missiles on the cities of Saudi Arabia ( or would be , if they were accurate enough ) .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #73:4>
In effect , he has been pursuing an unholy jihad not against the Western world but against the very centre of Islam itself .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #74:4>
Accordingly , his claim that he is pursuing a holy war against the enemies of the Prophet is de<l>monstrably and perniciously false and has rightly been repudiated by spokesmen for Islam in Britain and in many other countries .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #75:4>
The greatest enemy of the Arab world and of its religion is not and has never been the United States .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #76:4>
Nor is it Israel .
<ICE-GB:W2E-001 #77:4>
It is Saddam Hussein himself .

Britain at war
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #2:1>
&ldquo; THIS country is experiencing the greatest wave of jingoism that I have seen in my life , &rdquo; said Tony Benn in the House of Commons on Tuesday .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #3:1>
As usual , Mr Benn was talking tosh &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #4:1>
he cannot live in the same country as the rest of us .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #5:1>
Britain has gone to war the way a mature democracy should when it has to fight .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #6:1>
No gung-ho jingoism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #7:1>
No histrionic gestures or speeches .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #8:1>
No eu<l>phoria about easy victory .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #9:1>
No war fever , despite the overwhelming support for wag<l>ing war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #10:1>
The British are unequivocal about the need to fight and quietly resolute in their determination to win .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #11:1>
They are also enor<l>mously proud of the skill and courage of their armed forces .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #12:1>
But the pride and the patriotism are tempered by a clear-headed appreciation of the magnitude of the task ahead &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #13:1>
resolve is mixed with apprehension .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #14:1>
Those who would repeat the flag-waving of the Falklands and wrap themselves in the comic-book rhetoric of &ldquo; our boys &rdquo; mis<l>judge the mood of the nation as much as Mr Benn .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #15:1>
The sober realism of the British people will serve the country well in the weeks of fighting ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #16:1>
The first three days of the war have gone satisfactorily for the allies &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #17:1>
it should be put no higher than that .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #18:1>
Early expectations that aerial bombardment alone was going to deliver quick and easy victory are giving way this weekend to the grimmer realisation that we are in for a long , hard slog .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #19:1>
President Bush and the prime minister , John Major , both emerg<l>ing as consummate war leaders , have gone out of their way to puncture the absurd euphoria that characterised some of the first media reports .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #20:1>
It is now apparent that the allied bomb<l>ing of Iraq and its forces in Kuwait will have to continue for some time yet .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #21:1>
Even after a prolonged pounding , it is likely that much of Saddam Hussein 's war machine will survive intact , and will have to be engaged on the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #22:1>
&ldquo; That large [ Iraqi ] army is still sitting there and it will have to be rooted out , &rdquo; said General Tom Kelly at a Pentagon briefing on Friday afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #23:1>
A senior naval officer added that Saddam was still in control of that army .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #24:1>
Victory for the allies is not in doubt , but there is a long and bloody way to go yet .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #25:1>
The agreed allied aim is the liberation of Kuwait , but it must be pursued in a man<l>ner that also ensures the end of Saddam and the destruction of his war machine .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #26:1>
The United Nations resolutions authorising the allied use of force to free Kuwait also call for &ldquo; peace and security in the area &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #27:1>
That cannot be achieved as long as Saddam survives to terrorise the region .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #28:1>
He has already launched unprovoked attacks on three nations ( Iran , Kuwait and Israel ) .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #29:1>
Any victory which leaves him with the capability to do so again will not be a victory worth having .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #30:1>
There were absurd suggestions , only a few hours into the fight<l>ing , that there should be an early pause to allow Saddam to reconsider his position .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #31:1>
Fortunately , they were dismissed by the allied leaders .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #32:1>
But the greatest danger fac<l>ing the allies , which could thwart every<l>thing they have set out to achieve in this war , is that Saddam will call for a halt to hostilities soon and sue for peace without surrender .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #33:1>
Do not for a moment assume that such a move would mean peace in our time .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #34:1>
Saddam 's hero , President Nasser of Egypt , went from strength to strength on the basis of military defeats .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #35:1>
The Anglo-French force sent to retake the Suez canal in 1956 routed Nasser 's army .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #36:1>
But the Americans made it withdraw and Nasser emerged as the hero of the Arabs , strong enough to lead a united Arab world against Israel in 1967 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #37:1>
Nasser lost that war too , but he survived until his death three years later .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #38:1>
Saddam could easily follow a similar career path .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #39:1>
His gruelling , bloody struggle with Iran ended in stalemate , and even the few bits of land Iraq took have been handed back .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #40:1>
But Iraqi propaganda painted it a glorious victory for Saddam , and his hold on the country became stron<l>ger than ever .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #41:1>
Within two years he was raping and looting Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #42:1>
The war in the Gulf must not end the same way .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #43:1>
The only worthwhile victory will be one in which Saddam surrenders .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #44:1>
That need not mean allied tanks and troops going all the way to Baghdad , though if Saddam is determined to fight this war like his other hero , Adolf Hitler , it could come to that .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #45:1>
But it means the liberation of Kuwait must be accompanied by steps which en<l>sure the destruction of Iraq 's chemical and nuclear facilities ( and bombing alone might not do that ) , the substantial scaling<l->down of Iraq 's military capability and the securing of Iraqi war reparations for the rebuilding of Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #46:1>
If Saddam has not been killed in the fighting , then the terms of his surrender must be severe enough to ensure his overthrow by his own people .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #47:1>
The problems of the Middle East will not suddenly disappear with the Iraqi dic<l>tator 's demise .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #48:1>
But they are insoluble as long as he survives .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #49:1>
The British probably understand how dictators have to be dealt with better than most .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #50:1>
British resolve has been greater to get on with the conflict because the histori<l>cal shame of the 1930s , when dictators were allowed to spread their evil across Europe unchecked , still hangs over us .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #51:1>
The Americans , for their part , have been more reluctant to countenance hostilities because they see all potential conflicts through the funnel of Vietnam .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #52:1>
The lesson the British have learned is not to appease dictators because they cannot be assuaged .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #53:1>
The lesson America took from Vietnam was to avoid foreign military ventures altogether .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #54:1>
It is to President Bush 's great credit that he has overcome this historical legacy and commited American forces to their cur<l>rent task .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #55:1>
It is also to Britain 's great credit that it is standing shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the United States in this nec<l>essary venture , for it means that at least one European country is prepared to back the Americans when they are acting in the interests of the whole West .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #56:1>
Without Britain 's participation , the European con<l>tribution would be derisory , and America 's long-term commitment to the security of Europe seriously undermined .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #57:1>
As it is , the old wartime coalition has been revived and it represents the world 's best hope for the defeat of Saddam .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #58:2>
The duty of the banks
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #59:2>
HOW can a company be valued at over &pound-sign;2 billio billion billion in the summer and be worth noth<l>ing by the autumn ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #60:2>
How can a share which was recently the best-performing in the world - &pound-sign;1,000 invested at the start of the 1980s was worth &pound-sign;1.2m by the end - spiral to worthlessness in a matter of weeks ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #61:2>
After the collapse of Polly Peck Inter<l>national , plain folk will look on the work<l>ings of the City and business this weekend in bemusement and not a little concern .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #62:2>
They will be right .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #63:2>
It is something of a scandal to discover that a set of accounts - properly audited and signed , accepted by the biggest banks in the land , by the Stock Exchange , by lawyers and everyone else to give a true and fair view of a company 's affairs - can be out by a margin as monumental as this .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #64:2>
Polly Peck was not buoyed up only by small investors looking to make a fast buck .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #65:2>
The company was accorded its enor<l>mous value by the big pension funds and insurance companies , guardians of so many people 's life savings &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #66:2>
they are sup<l>posed to be experts at reading the runes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #67:2>
When it came to Polly Peck they were apparently struck blind , and the cost has been high .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #68:2>
The Post Office pension fund , for example , is minus &pound-sign;40m on its Polly Peck shares in the blink of an eyelid .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #69:2>
That adds up to quite a few postmen working overtime to give themselves something in retirement .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #70:2>
It also suggests gaping holes in auditing procedures and in the systems of regula<l>tion &semi; and a disturbing naivety on the part of the big investors .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #71:2>
Small investors took comfort from the fact that so many of the big institutions , with all their research and analytical capacity , were aboard .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #72:2>
In the end nobody - not the accountants , not the bankers who will have to write off millions , not the stockbrokers or the lawyers - spot<l>ted a thing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #73:2>
Department of Trade inspec<l>tors and the Serious Fraud Office between them may now uncover what was really going on , and for how long .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #74:2>
They must tell us why the alarm bells did not ring sooner , and who in the City is to blame .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #75:2>
The crash of Polly Peck is the biggest in British corporate history , but only in nom<l>inal terms .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #76:2>
Its impact , on politics or the economy , does not compare with the giant crashes of the past , such as Rolls-Royce in 1971 or Burmah Oil in 1975 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #77:2>
Polly Peck was a relatively new company , its activities largely based in Cyprus and Turkey &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #78:2>
it was part of the anomalous froth now being blown off a boom that had run for 10 years and which had thrown up the usual num<l>ber of excesses .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #79:2>
Polly Peck , whose core business was essentially picking fruit off the overladen trees of war-torn Cyprus , packing it into cardboard boxes and distributing it to the northern European markets , was a financially driven , stock-market-oriented company , rather than an industrial group of the old school .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #80:2>
It is important to the Turkish and Cypriot communities , where it employs thousands of people .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #81:2>
But in Britain the waves will close over its grave without a ripple .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #82:2>
Polly Peck 's demise is significant never<l>theless .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #83:2>
It was triggered by investigations of the Sunday Times into its activities , including some dubious share dealings .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #84:2>
But it was also a victim of high interest rates and a harsh economic climate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #85:2>
Many more companies are destined to follow in its footsteps .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #86:2>
Recession has arrived in Britain with a vengeance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #87:2>
Even the chan<l>cellor , John Major , almost acknowledged it last week .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #88:2>
Across the land , firms are cutting back spending , cancelling orders , laying off or not replacing staff - in short , taking all the actions that ensure that the summer slowdown deepens into winter recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #89:2>
There is nothing new , or necessarily disastrous , in all this .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #90:2>
Industrial cycles have been around since Napoleonic days , and will likely be around for centuries yet .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #91:2>
Every shopkeeper , hotelier , taxi-driver and hall porter knows as well as the chairman of ICI that no boom goes on forever , and that sooner or later there is a pause , even a downturn - yes , even a recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #92:2>
Every sensible person prepares for it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #93:2>
The Polly Pecks of this world do not .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #94:2>
Last week a firm of accountants warned that the total number of business failures could reach 25,000 by the end of the year , a new record .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #95:2>
Stock-market rumours about companies going bust abound , most of them spurious , some of them with more than a grain of truth .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #96:2>
Polly Peck-type prob<l>lems are a result of too many banks lending far too much money in the good times .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #97:2>
American , Swiss , French and - particu<l>larly - Japanese banks have all flooded into Britain offering money on terms de<l>signed to win a market share .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #98:2>
Polly Peck is merely an example of how one clever com<l>pany exploited the banks ' competitive ( or lemming ) instincts to lift its total debt to &pound-sign;1.4 bill billion billion on assets that are probably about &pound-sign;300m less than that .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #99:2>
Hundreds of companies are now in similar positions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #100:2>
The problem is that some of the banks are in poor shape , too &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #101:2>
that makes them dou<l>bly desperate to get their money back .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #102:2>
But they have responsibilities , and the spot<l>light must now fall on the banks to make sure they live up to them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #103:2>
In the deepening recession good com<l>panies as well as bad are being plunged into liquidity problems .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #104:2>
On the whole they have only themselves to blame , but the banks are culpable in encouraging them to over-expand in the good times , just as they once encouraged the Third world coun<l>tries to borrow , and then to demand their money back at the first whiff of trouble .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #105:2>
The governor of the Bank of England , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , laid down some ground rules for banks last week in helping their customers through the worst of the recession , which amounted to a plea to do what they can to save the good ones , and to let the bad ones go .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #106:2>
Although he is far too polite to say so explicitly , his message is : you got them into trouble , now get them out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #X107:2>

<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #X108:2>

<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #X109:2>

<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #X110:2>

<ICE-GB:W2E-002 #X111:2>

<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #1:1>
Unity : and who can provide it
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #2:1>
THE KEY word now is unity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #3:1>
And Michael Hesel<l>tine was absolutely right to set it at the heart of his Henley letter ( and subsequent postcards from Amman ) .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #4:1>
The &ldquo; Tory Party should remember that its essential appeal is the appeal of a nation united &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #5:1>
Pre<l>cisely .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #6:1>
But , as Mr Heseltine well knows , the unravelling events of the last 10 days have made any conventional expressions of unity , any forms of words or crafted com<l>promises , simply impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #7:1>
There can be no real unity for the Conservatives under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #8:1>
His letter isn't a turning point in the gather<l>ing crisis of her premiership :
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #9:1>
it is just one blow amongst many .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #10:1>
In a sense , the truly dreadful public opinion poll results yesterday are more important .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #11:1>
They show an electorate utterly fed up with her , a Labour lead bal<l>looning , and a humiliation coming in Bradford North that must hammer more nails in the coffin of her repu<l>tation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #12:1>
Success unifies a party .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #13:1>
But there is no success .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #14:1>
Failure and hopelessness divide .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #15:1>
There is plenty of that .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #16:1>
The big , racketing row is about Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #17:1>
She can't hold the ring there .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #18:1>
Her pother of prejudices and sub-Chur<l>chillian rhetoric instantly fracture any efforts for con<l>sensus .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #19:1>
But , beyond even the fault lines of Europe the litany of ministers she has lost - rehearsed with feline skill in the Heseltine text - renders her unfit for the task ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #20:1>
It is all sliding away from her .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #21:1>
As MPs return from their constituencies this week , brooding on the bleakness ahead that slide will inexorably continue .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #22:1>
The question for the Conservatives - and for Downing Street , especially - is : what 's to be done ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #23:1>
Many true leaders , at such a point , would not hesitate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #24:1>
They would judge that their continued presence , and continued convictions , made graceful retirement inev<l>itable .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #25:1>
There 's some pragmatism to that , even for Mrs Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #26:1>
If she cares about a strong British voice in European negotiations , she should see that her voice is utterly enfeebled because , when she speaks , she does so neither for Government nor party .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #27:1>
But the raging ego that cavorted across the Commons last Tuesday is hardly likely to register such realities .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #28:1>
No .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #29:1>
No .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #30:1>
No .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #31:1>
If she is to go , she will have to be driven out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #32:1>
At this juncture , mere observers of politics may retire to a prudent distance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #33:1>
It could not be clearer to the Conservatives that the Prime Minister has become a political Polly Peck .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #34:1>
It could not be clearer that their seats , powers , cars and pay cheques are all in pawn .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #35:1>
If they haven't the strength or the realism to do anything about it , then fatalism rules and their administration can benignly be confined consigned to history .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #36:1>
But the Tory par<l>ty 's history has realism engraved at its heart .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #37:1>
The exag<l>gerated cheers for a leader can freeze on the lips over<l>night .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #38:1>
The object of adulation can turn into Ted Heath .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #39:1>
There is a leadership contest scheduled and immi<l>nent .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #40:1>
It would be ridiculous in such circumstances if it were to pass uncontested .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #41:1>
And Mr Heseltine has proba<l>bly edged himself now to the point of no return :
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #42:1>
he 'll look foolish if he declines to stand .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #43:1>
This isn't stalking horse time .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #44:1>
This is the moment when , if unity truly mat<l>ters , the party must make a fresh start .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #45:1>
In many ways , the Heseltine prescription doesn't fit .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #46:1>
With his charisma and certainty , Mr Heseltine isn't so very far in style from Mrs Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #47:1>
He is as passion<l>ately for positive involvement with Europe as she is pas<l>sionately opposed to it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #48:1>
He would have his problems healing back bench divisions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #49:1>
But if , like Mrs Thatcher before him , he alone has the audacity for the challenge , he will deserve the spoils .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #50:1>
The problem for Cabinet colleagues he will seek to lead is acute .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #51:1>
Do they sink with the old captain , mouth<l>ing cardboard words of loyalty ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #52:1>
Or do they join the fray ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #53:1>
There 's no doubt , reading the Heseltine letter , who would be the best unifier if unity is all .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #54:1>
As he showed again in yesterday 's no-score television draw with Brian Walden , Douglas Hurd is the classiest act the governing circIe has .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #55:1>
But can he , and those who would support him find a way of extricating themselves from under the lady 's shawl ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #56:1>
&ldquo; I think it will be all right , &rdquo; said Mr Hurd in a crowning sentence of elliptical emollience in which every word can have a different stress which ren<l>ders a different overall meaning .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #57:1>
But it won't be all right :
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #58:1>
the question is whether he , or any of the other questors after unity , can now help to make it so .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #59:2>
The best big bang
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #60:2>
NOVEMBER 5 has been getting a bad press .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #61:2>
Last week 's newspapers were full of tales about a surge of popular enthusiasm for Halloween at its expense .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #62:2>
For some time , a somewhat apologetic tone has begun to creep into the established view of the annual celebra<l>tions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #63:2>
An understandable , if occasionally nannyish , atti<l>tude to the perils of fireworks has discouraged people from back garden festivities and has urged them out to supposedly safer civic displays .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #64:2>
At the same time , an unduly sensitive attitude to Guy Fawkes Night has en<l>couraged a kind of guilt complex , as though Bonfire Night can somehow still seriously be thought to fan long-extinguished flames of anti-Catholic sentiment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #65:2>
So it 's about time someone spoke up for Bonfire Night .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #66:2>
The great thing about November 5 - and also , one suspects , the real reason why it is now being dispar<l>aged - is simple .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #67:2>
It is the one major surviving national celebration which is truly popular , in the sense of be<l>longing to the people , and which also - crucial factor - cannot be taken over by television .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #68:2>
This distinguishes it from spectaculars like sports or civic events which are popular and on television , and from celebrations like Christmas , now dominated by the box .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #69:2>
Nobody ever had a bonfire in the sitting room - not intentionally , at any rate - while televised fireworks are a pallid substitute for the real thing exploding across the sky .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #70:2>
This makes Bonfire Night the enemy of advertising .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #71:2>
Notwithstanding the advertising of fire<l>works , it offers precious little for the admen , for two reasons : because aren't supposed to be sold to children and because Bonfire Night depends on people committing the greatest of contemporary defiances - leaving home at night when they could be watching ad<l>vertisments on television .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #72:2>
Compare and contrast the now much vaunted Halloween .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #73:2>
Don't be taken in by the idea that it is more interesting and exciting than No<l>vember 5 :
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #74:2>
it isn't .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #75:2>
The reason why a revived Halloween is approved is because it is a massive new advertising opportunity , in particular in the children 's market .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #76:2>
Hal<l>loween is all about exploiting the biggest television audi<l>ence of the lot , who will moan and sulk and throw tan<l>trums until they can get the sweets , masks and trash toys now aimed at them every October .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #77:2>
And this is not even to mention the dangerous Halloween subtext that to go out at night is to court horror and danger .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #78:2>
So stir yourselves tonight .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #79:2>
Lock the cat in , prepare the sausages and the parkin , get the children outside , light the blue touch paper and reflect over the ginger beer that you are part of the real festival of Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #80:3>
More to share than the burden
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #81:3>
WHEN MRS Thatcher briskly com<l>mitted British troops to the Gulf last year there was scant talk of sharing the financial burden with other nations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #82:3>
It was politically impossible to raise the matter where it should have been discussed : in the United Nations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #83:3>
Money and morality ( and Soviet support ) didn't mix .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #84:3>
Nor was there much thought of Britain asking , or even expecting , other nations to contribute bilaterally .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #85:3>
Undigni<l>fied .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #86:3>
And it would have run the risk of British soldiers being seen as mercenaries .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #87:3>
No such scruples or shynesses af<l>fected President Bush who , from the start , expected other nations to contribute and rattled his can with a robustness which has already netted pledges of $13 billion from Tokyo ( about half-a-day 's eco<l>nomic wealth for Japan ) and $13.5 billion each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 's gov<l>ernment-in-exile , all covering the first three months of the campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #88:3>
Meanwhile our new Chancellor , Norman Lamont , retreating from the Thatcherite high ground , could be found yesterday trying to cajole his European colleagues into coughing up more towards the &pound-sign;3.6 mill million million a day ( running ) cost of the British war effort : and even tagging wan threats about economic union to his entreaties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #89:3>
Assessing the real cost of the war is a highly speculative exercise : depending on how long it lasts , what costs would have been incurred anyway , who else might be dragged in , who else might share the cost - and what costs should be excluded from the budget on the grounds that the hard<l>ware lost will not have to be replaced .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #90:3>
On one interpretation , America 's involve<l>ment could perhaps be regarded as a mas<l>sive destocking exercise as the nation sheds itself of surplus Cold War arma<l>ments after glasnost .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #91:3>
But we should be wary of swallowing that whole , if only because recent events in the Gulf and in the Soviet Union are already prompting reassessments of the peace dividend .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #92:3>
One thing which needs to be knocked on the head sharply , though , is the propo<l>sition that a reasonably short war will give a timely boost to the recession-racked international economy - because oil prices will tumble lower than they other<l>wise would have done .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #93:3>
Some economists have even talked of the war paying for itself through ( oil-induced ) lower inflation and higher growth .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #94:3>
Be sceptical here .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #95:3>
Any benefits from this direction , however wel<l>come , come not from the war per se , but from the decision of the international authorities to release oil from strategic stocks .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #96:3>
It could ( indeed should ) have done this anyway as a counter-cyclical tool to kick-start the stalled world economy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #97:3>
The true situation carries a few hard lessons for Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #98:3>
First , the Hindsight Saga .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #99:3>
The time to get involved in burden sharing was earlier , when the White House moved into action .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #100:3>
But then we were ( too proudly ) doing nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #101:3>
Now there is only lost ground and lost revenue to be recovered .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #102:3>
Second , get the tin-rattling and the di<l>plomacy into synchronisation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #103:3>
Mr Lamont is having to plead poverty in Europe against a din of minor politicians de<l>nouncing the feeble , penny-pinching wimps of the Community .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #104:3>
That is , simply , dotty politicking .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #105:3>
Three , concentrate on the central dis<l>locations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #106:3>
We are currently writing off - far too emotionally - any prospect of a co<l>ordinated European defence policy , which would sensibly include a multi-national force on stand-by for rapid deployment to crisis points .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #107:3>
Where could that force be used ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #108:3>
Perhaps only in Europe &semi; but , after the Gulf , perhaps more widely .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #109:3>
That 's an argument to come .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #110:3>
But we 'll never have it if we insist on shunning the defence debate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #111:3>
Four , if the UN emerges intact from the crisis , it would be far better to see the cost of any future war channelled through New York .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #112:3>
That was obviously politically impossible this time .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #113:3>
But there is ( again ) clear need for that permanent , mobile force , properly and fairly financed , poised to keep the peace and to monitor whatever settlement emerges from the Middle East cauldron .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #114:3>
And , finally , there is a ( domestic ) les<l>son for a government which appears much more willing to borrow money to promulgate a war than to borrow to fi<l>nance the peace .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #115:3>
As happened during the Falklands expedition , the Government 's antipathy to borrowing is suddenly dropped on the grounds that the City mar<l>kets won't object to a on-off expenditure of this nature .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #116:3>
Suddenly , room has been found for an extra &pound-sign;2 to &pound-sign;3 billion of bor<l>rowing in this year 's hitherto sacrosanct targets .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #117:3>
If that is so in crisis , then it is high time that the Government tried to educate the markets to see the benefits of borrowing money for long-term seed-corn projects like education , training , research and the encouragement of investment by manufacturing industry .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #118:3>
The planning of the conflict , so far , has been a meticulous exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2E-003 #119:3>
It would be nice , if premature , to think that it might lead to the resuscita<l>tion of the concept of planning in the econ<l>omy at large .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #1:1>
Heseltine 's misguided detractors
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #2:1>
SEVERAL unfounded objections to Michael Heseltine 's leadership challenge have been advanced by some of Margaret Thatcher 's supporters .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #3:1>
The most widespread charge , made by her campaign manager , George Younger , among others , is that it is wrong to hold a contest while British troops are de<l>ployed in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #4:1>
If anything , the reverse is true .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #5:1>
The authority of the Prime Minister has been severely damaged by the more and more public split in the Cabinet and Conser<l>vative Party over policy towards Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #6:1>
This difference needs to be settled by a leadership election , not papered over .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #7:1>
One of the most vital tasks for the victor will be to reunite the party round an agreed European policy , for only then will the authority of the British Prime Minister be repaired .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #8:1>
As for policy towards Saddam Hussein , Mr Heseltine has been no less resolute than Mrs Thatcher in insisting that the dictator must withdraw from Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #9:1>
Moreover , British forces have not been sent to the Gulf in order to defend our Prime Minister .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #10:1>
She might like , in response to gloating from Baghdad at her difficulties , to remark on the favourable con<l>trast between her openness to domestic chal<l>lenge and the more restrictive attitude taken by Saddam Hussein .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #11:1>
The contest for the Con<l>servative Party leadership will not last long and , as various observers have pointed out , the changes of Prime Minister in 1916 and 1940 occurred when the nation was in far worse difficulties , fighting for survival rather than deploying troops for a war which may or may not happen .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #12:1>
A second criticism made of Mr Heseltine is that he said he could not foresee circum<l>stances in which he would run .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #13:1>
The reply to this is simple .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #14:1>
Circumstances have changed , as Sir Geoffrey Howe 's speech demon<l>strated , and Conservatives generally regard it as a virtue to take account of changed cir<l>cumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #15:1>
The Secretary of State for Employment , Michael Howard , yesterday said of Mr Hesel<l>tine : &ldquo; He has been the most divisive figure in the party for the last five years . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #16:1>
Mr Howard underestimates the Prime Minister .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #17:1>
By the intransigent manner in which she has ap<l>proached the vital question of Britain 's rela<l>tions with the rest of the European Commu<l>nity , she has done more to divide the Con<l>servatives than anyone else .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #18:1>
Not just Mr Heseltine 's resignation &semi; but those of Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe have re<l>vealed her inability to maintain unity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #19:1>
Nicholas Ridley was also obliged to resign from the Cabinet on the issue of Europe , but in his case because he shares with Mrs That<l>cher and a few other Conservative MPs an overriding and atavistic hostility towards the EC &semi; an emotion so strong that maintaining the pragmatic policy commended on Tuesday by Sir Geoffrey becomes impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #20:1>
Mr Rid<l>ley yesterday declared : &ldquo; The wrong reason for seeking office is a burning desire to be Prime Minister or a Cabinet minister without a clear idea of what you have to do . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #21:1>
In other words , he accuses Mr Heseltine of ambition - as if that motive could ever be wholly ex<l>cluded from politics - and lack of clarity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #22:1>
But Mr Heseltine seems to have a much clearer understanding of the need for party unity and a positive approach to Europe than Mrs Thatcher does .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #23:1>
If the Prime Minister 's supporters cannot do better than this , they deserve to lose .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #24:2>
Bush needs public support
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #25:2>
IN A few weeks , the United States will have almost half a million servicemen and women in the Gulf region .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #26:2>
Such a force could never be described as purely deterrent or defensive .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #27:2>
The dispatch of massive reinforcements has brought home to the American public and to the world that a war to drive Saddam Hus<l>sein 's troops out of Kuwait is very likely .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #28:2>
In that conflict , American forces would bear the heaviest casualties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #29:2>
At home , George Bush is being sharply criticised for not having ade<l>quately explained why he is virtually doubling American forces in the Gulf , or why national interests are at stake .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #30:2>
Mr Bush 's critics are right .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #31:2>
His original aims - the restoration of Kuwait 's sover<l>eignty , honouring the United States 's com<l>mitment to security and stability in the Gulf , and the protection of American citizens abroad - were defined on 8 August , six days after the invasion of Kuwait , and backed up by economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #32:2>
Since then much has changed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #33:2>
Kuwait has been raped and looted , and many of its citizens murdered .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #34:2>
Western citizens have been heartlessly used as hos<l>tages and to provide a human shield .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #35:2>
Sanc<l>tions are now widely seen as unlikely to force President Saddam to relinquish Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #36:2>
A huge force has been assembled in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #37:2>
Yet not since his speech on 8 August has Mr Bush addressed the American people with a coherent analysis and justification of his administration 's objectives , and ( within the bounds of security ) of the strategy that will be used to secure them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #38:2>
Typical Bush comments such as &ldquo; I 've had it with that kind of treatment of Americans &rdquo; are no substi<l>tute : as one American commentator ob<l>served , they show a confusion between auto<l>biography and foreign policy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #39:2>
Neither has Congress debated whether war is justified to secure the goals agreed at the UN .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #40:2>
Over that question there looms the long shadow of possible casualties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #41:2>
Most of the high estimates are based on the early use of allied ground forces in a frontal assault to ex<l>pel Iraqi troops from their well-fortified posi<l>tions defending Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #42:2>
Such an attack would take a terrible toll .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #43:2>
There are strong arguments for using ground forces only after a heavy initial aerial and naval bombard<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #44:2>
As Henry Kissinger has argued in the Los Angeles Times , bombs , shells and missiles could be used to destroy Iraq 's military and industrial complexes as well as its air and mis<l>sile forces .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #45:2>
In such an attack , communication and supply lines between Iraq and Iraqi troops in Kuwait would be cut .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #46:2>
Allied ground troops might be needed only to hold Kuwait after the Iraqi soldiers had been flushed out by hunger , and again attacked from the air .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #47:2>
Such a plan might run into opposition from the American army , which would not want to be sidelined :
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #48:2>
inter-service rivalry is a reality of life in the Pentagon , and General Colin Powell , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , is an army man and Vietnam veteran .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #49:2>
Mr Bush must not allow such considerations to affect his choice of strategy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #50:2>
At the same time he must remember one of the principal lessons of Vietnam : that wars cannot be suc<l>cessfully pursued without strong public sup<l>port .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #51:2>
With a UN resolution sanctioning the use of force , a powerful address on TV and a Congress debate behind him , he would be much more strongly placed to weather the political strains of war and its aftermath .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #52:3>
A certain election-loser
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #53:3>
IN HER spirited report to the House of Commons on the Rome summit meeting , Margaret Thatcher appeared to indicate that the defence of the British Government 's sov<l>ereignty against encroachments from Brus<l>sels would be a central theme of the next election campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #54:3>
&ldquo; I hope , &rdquo; she said , &ldquo; that when the next election comes , people who want to come to this House will come to up<l>hold its powers and its responsibilities , and not to denude the House of them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #55:3>
We have surrendered some of them to the Commu<l>nity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #56:3>
In my view we have surrendered enough . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #57:3>
The Labour Party 's 1983 election mani<l>festo , which committed it to a non-nuclear defence policy and , be it remembered , to withdrawal from the European Community , became known as &ldquo; the longest suicide note in history &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #58:3>
A Conservative Party manifesto hostile to Britain 's closer integration into the European Community might qualify as Death Wish II .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #59:3>
First and foremost , such a campaign would bitterly divide the party .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #60:3>
The long debate over full participation in the Eu<l>ropean Monetary System revealed the rifts over economic and monetary union .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #61:3>
To fight an election on the issue that most divides the party would be madness .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #62:3>
For many Conservatives , it is an article of personal and political faith that Britain must play a full part in European unification .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #63:3>
Dur<l>ing the long years of Labour 's hostility to the EC , it was the Tories who kept the European flame burning in Britain .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #64:3>
For the roles to be reversed would be a tragedy for many Con<l>servative MPs and voters .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #65:3>
Second , an anti-Brussels campaign would lose the Conservatives the support of its nat<l>ural allies in business and the City .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #66:3>
Those in the front line of the British economy are united in believing that Britain must remain a full playing member of the EC :
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #67:3>
should it drop into a second league or tier , much could be lost - including the City 's pre-eminence as a European financial centre .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #68:3>
Third , to campaign on sovereignty might attract some votes from older Britons who still see the Continent as some form of threat .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #69:3>
But all the evidence suggests that young peo<l>ple are strongly pro-European .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #70:3>
In judging governments and institutions , they are more likely to be impressed by results than by tradi<l>tion or history .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #71:3>
By saying &ldquo; No ! &rdquo; to Brussels , the Conserva<l>tives might win a few votes from older La<l>bour supporters .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #72:3>
But they would lose many votes , from potential young supporters , to Labour or to the Liberal Democrats .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #73:3>
Such a campaign would inevitably appear backward-looking and nationalistic .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #74:3>
Michael Heseltine , a convinced European , made this point in yesterday 's Daily Mail when he wrote : &ldquo; Winning elections is about a vision .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #75:3>
is about enthusiasms .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #76:3>
is about the future . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #77:3>
Drawing lines of defence against Brussels would seem anything but visionary .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #78:3>
It would also be very damaging to Britain 's reputation abroad , where this country 's preoccupation with the past causes perplexity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #79:3>
Mrs Thatcher knows well enough that no election can be fought , referendum-like , on a single issue .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #80:3>
Questions such as the future control of Britain 's currency would be over<l>taken by more immediate matters : inflation , the poll tax , NHS , schools and unemploy<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #81:3>
Her Cabinet colleagues will seek to di<l>vert her from any such intention .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #82:3>
If she ig<l>nores their advice , her remarkable career is likely to come to an ignoble end .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #83:4>
Dishonesty at the top
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #84:4>
&ldquo; GROTESQUE , unbelievable , bizarre , un<l>precedented &rdquo; were among the adjectives used by Charles J Haughey , Prime Minister of the Irish Republic , to describe an earlier scandal involving himself .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #85:4>
These terms are not applicable to the latest case in which he has been entwined .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #86:4>
It is better called usual , believable , unsurprising .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #87:4>
This time the trouble arose because the Deputy Prime Minister , Brian Lenihan , who is also his party 's presidential candidate , gave two conflicting accounts of his dealings with President Hillery in 1982 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #88:4>
Mr Lenihan denied that in January of that year he had attempted to put pressure on the president to invite Mr Haughey to form a government .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #89:4>
A tape re<l>cording was then published in which Mr Lenihan freely admitted he had rung the president .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #90:4>
Confronted with this evidence , Mr Lenihan said that &ldquo; on mature recollection &rdquo; he had not telephoned the president .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #91:4>
In a poll published yesterday in Dublin , 57 per cent of respondents said they thought Mr Lenihan had made the call , and certainly the tape-recording had , if the phrase can be for<l>given , the ring of truth about it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #92:4>
This lie is in itself a fairly pathetic thing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #93:4>
It does not compare with the &ldquo; grotesque &rdquo; epi<l>sode later in 1982 when Mr Haughey had be<l>come prime minister and the police discov<l>ered a suspected murderer ( afterwards convicted ) staying at the Attorney General 's flat .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #94:4>
The Attorney General in due course re<l>signed , though only after he had attempted to take a holiday in America .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #95:4>
Mr Lenihan likewise resisted resignation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #96:4>
The opposition duly tabled yesterday 's mo<l>tion of no confidence , leaving Mr Haughey dependent on the support of his coalition partners , the Progressive Democrats .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #97:4>
They originally broke away from Mr Haughey 's party in disgust at the unprincipled way in which he led it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #98:4>
During yesterday 's proceed<l>ings , the leader of the Labour Party , Dick Spring , described the prime minister as &ldquo; the virus which has caused the cancer that is eat<l>ing away at our body politic &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #99:4>
From a moral point of view , Mr Spring is unquestionably right .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #100:4>
It must be admitted that Mr Haughey is a stylish virus , more entertaining than some of his detractors .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #101:4>
While he has many horrible faults , he is immune to priggery .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #102:4>
Moreover , Irish voters have wisely never given him an overall parliamentary majority .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #103:4>
There is no knowing what mischief he might have caused if they had .
<ICE-GB:W2E-004 #104:4>
He has recently been held in check by the Progressive Democrats , and has adopted the relatively sound economic poli<l>cies advocated by his opponents .

Voice of authority
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #2:1>
IT IS clear from the Prime Minister 's demean<l>our and words that his commitment to the use of force in the Gulf is untouched by enthusi<l>asm for the prospect of war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #3:1>
Sometimes , as with Churchill during the Second World War and Mrs Thatcher during the Falklands , prime ministers have seemed to relish the task of governing in time of battle .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #4:1>
Mr Major displays no such relish , but that does not mean that he is unequal to the challenge .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #5:1>
Indeed , his obvious lack of personal bellicosity is appropriate to the current situation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #6:1>
He knows that opinion in Britain needs reassurance on the justice of our involvement in a war over Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #7:1>
Persuasion that the cause is right , and honest information about it , are preferable to any<l>thing smelling of jingoism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #8:1>
The Government has made plans to keep the public informed and its own position clear during the war in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #9:1>
Mr Hurd , the Foreign Secretary , and Mr King , the Defence Secretary , are to become front-line spokesmen for the Government dur<l>ing the conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #10:1>
Excellent though they both are , they may not be enough .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #11:1>
The situation is different from that during the Falk<l>lands war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #12:1>
The mass media have undergone radical change since then .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #13:1>
Worldwide availability of satellite and cable news services , the multiplicity of news net<l>works and the sophistication of broadcast technology mean a Gulf war will be brought into the sitting rooms of combatant nations with an immediacy unseen in previous wars .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #14:1>
Although the Government is not look<l>ing to make political capital out of this tragedy , it could easily suffer political damage if its view of events is not presented clearly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #15:1>
Bad presentation could weaken mo<l>rale at home .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #16:1>
It is important the public should have proper accounts and explanations of developments not just from American spokesmen - who , as America is making the major contribution to the allied effort , will be most in evidence - but from a senior figure in the British Government , free of other departmental res<l>ponsibilities and therefore able to put over the Govern<l>ment 's view without distraction .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #17:1>
Whatever the good intentions of using Mr Hurd and Mr King in this role , the demands upon them simply in prosecuting the war will be immense .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #18:1>
It will be imprac<l>ticable for them to be available as often as the media will now demand .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #19:1>
Mr Wakeham , as Energy Secretary a member of the War Cabinet , is the minister in charge of presentation of policy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #20:1>
That important role is one which , as a former Chief Whip and Leader of the Commons , he has the political feel to discharge better than most .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #21:1>
However , Mr Wakeham 's departmental res<l>ponsibilities , too , will become onerous if there is severe disruption of oil supplies , nor is he a very accomplished public communicator .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #22:1>
The obvious man to put the Government 's message over is Mr Chris Patten , who as chairman of the Con<l>servative party has no departmental duties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #23:1>
He is already playing a leading behind-the-scenes role in planning for the presentation of information .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #24:1>
One of his predecessors , Mr Cecil Parkinson , had the role of spokesman during the Falklands war and made a suc<l>cess of it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #25:1>
Mr Patten has the authority of Cabinet rank .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #26:1>
He combines calm sincerity with high intelligence and has that rare gift ( for a politician ) of inviting trust .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #27:1>
Mr Major should make him the full-time spokesman , with a place in the War Cabinet , without delay .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #28:2>
Socialist folly
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #29:2>
IN EARLIER times , rich men built follies &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #30:2>
today , more often than not , follies are created only by socialist local authorities close to bankruptcy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #31:2>
Sheffield City Council , in Labour control for more than half a century , struggling for revival after the collapse of its steel industry ( with the loss of 60,000 jobs in four years ) , took on the 1991 World Student Games .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #32:2>
Having spent tens of millions , Sheffield 's councillors are chagrined to find that in terms of popular interest , these games rate low .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #33:2>
Deeper in the red than ever and with grim prospects for Sheffield 's poll tax payers , the city , as we report else<l>where , has approached the Environment Secretary .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #34:2>
In this respect only , Sheffield chose shrewdly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #35:2>
In years past Mr Heseltine has shown marked sympathy towards formerly grand cities , such as Liverpool , which were down on their luck .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #36:2>
At this meeting , how<l>ever , there were good reasons for the Secretary of State to respond firmly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #37:2>
The ready inclination of cities to bid for large events , such as World Student Games , in the hope that they will thereby secure fame and fortune , needs sharply to be banged on the head .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #38:2>
For one thing , city councillors simply are not equipped to take on and sell enormous projects of this kind .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #39:2>
Since 1959 six of the previous 15 World Student Games have been staged in formerly Eastern bloc countries , seeking pro<l>paganda and prestige irrespective of the cost .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #40:2>
All expe<l>rience of these games so far has shown that they do not pay their way , and require a hefty contribution from public funds .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #41:2>
The taxpayer owes Sheffield nothing for such a scheme as these student games .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #42:3>
The epitaph of Sir Geoffrey Howe
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #43:3>
SIR GEOFFREY HOWE 'S personal statement upon his resignation from the Government was dignified , witty , measured , formidable .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #44:3>
Coming from a former minister of his experi<l>ence and seniority , it was the most damaging attack that the Prime Minister has yet suffered upon her leadership , and indeed ended with an overt call to his parliamentary colleagues to review their loyalty to her .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #45:3>
It is both inevitable and right that Conservatives should give the most careful consideration to the for<l>mer Deputy Prime Minister 's words before making their personal decisions about what view to take of their party 's dilemma .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #46:3>
Sir Geoffrey was generous about the Prime Minis<l>ter 's past achievements , and warm in his recollection of their old personal partnership .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #47:3>
But when he began to address his central theme of Mrs Thatcher and Europe , he spared nothing in offering a forceful condemnation of her performance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #48:3>
He declared that , on the issue of British policy towards Europe , style and substance were &ldquo; two sides of the same coin &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #49:3>
He strongly criti<l>cised the Prime Minister 's failure to allow British entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism five years ago , when economic conditions were more favourable .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #50:3>
He acknowledged that the Delors plan and conduct of the recent Rome summit were deserving of criticism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #51:3>
But he argued that the Prime Minister 's broad approach , laden with its deep suspicions of European schemes and intentions , increasingly risks isolating Britain from the planning of the future of the Continent , with consequences that could persist for generations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #52:3>
He suggested that the European perception of Brit<l>ain and of British attitudes focuses decisively upon the behaviour and demeanour of the Prime Minister her<l>self , and thus that even her spontaneous expressions of dismay towards Brussels do disproportionate damage to our diplomacy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #53:3>
He evoked the memory of two Con<l>servative icons , Churchill and Macmillan , in support of the contention that our future must lie with Europe and that there is a &ldquo; middle way &rdquo; between the grandiose federalism of M Delors and the negativism of Mrs Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #54:3>
Finally , and most damaging , he accused the Prime Minister of destroying the negotiating position of her own Government before talks have even begun , by her personal style and declared hostility to the visions apparently shared by the Eleven , and even to her own Chancellor 's concept of the &ldquo; hard ecu &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #55:3>
We have often expressed dismay in these columns about the Prime Minister 's personal style in address<l>ing the issue of Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #56:3>
But we have avowed our strong support for her position on the issues of substance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #57:3>
It has also seemed to us paramount that , whatever differ<l>ences of detail and even of policy which may exist among Conservatives , the party should not rend itself asunder on Europe , but should maintain its historic stature as a coalition of interests .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #58:3>
In his speech yester<l>day , Sir Geoffrey 's style was moderate , but his sub<l>stance was deeply divisive .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #59:3>
He demanded , essentially , that Conservatives should now choose sides on Europe and nail their colours to the mast .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #60:3>
After so many years in which party unity behind the leader has been rightly perceived as the first priority in order to gain and retain power , and to exercise government , Sir Geoffrey now asks Tories to cast aside this central principle of politi<l>cal survival , to ignore the Prime Minister 's immense contribution upon a host of domestic and other interna<l>tional matters and to impale themselves upon the single issue of Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #61:3>
It is a profound sadness to behold a major political figure , who has performed so much public service over so many years , now advocat<l>ing a course which , if pursued , can serve only the electoral prospects of the Labour party .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #62:3>
Sir Geoffrey 's speech has intensified speculation at Westminster that a formal challenge to Mrs Thatcher 's leadership of the Conservative party has become inev<l>itable .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #63:3>
Given his own longstanding commitment to Europe , his obsession with this theme and , indeed , the extinguishing of his career in government as a conse<l>quence of it , deserve understanding .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #64:3>
But before Con<l>servative MPs follow any fevered rush to the brink of the political cliff , they should pause and ask them<l>selves the question :
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #65:3>
Whose view of the Government 's predicament , and of its European policy , deserves their trust and support ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #66:3>
That of Sir Geoffrey Howe ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #67:3>
Or that of the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor , who are convinced they can work alongside the Prime Minister in pursuit of a policy which will enable Britain to negotiate constructively and positively with our part<l>ners of the European Community without abandoning ourselves to fantasies of a federal Europe ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #68:3>
Sir Geof<l>frey 's speech yesterday was an epitaph to his own long and distinguished career in government .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #69:3>
It must not be allowed to pass as an epitaph for this Conservative administration .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #70:4>
Allied advantage
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #71:4>
EVERY war possesses a grim rhythm .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #72:4>
That of Vietnam was created over years of frustration and disappointment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #73:4>
The Middle East conflict in 1967 was a rare example of rapid movement and speedy decision .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #74:4>
The Second World War domi<l>nated the entire youthful experience of a generation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #75:4>
As the Gulf conflict unfolds , a new generation is being compelled to learn how to live with the knowledge that thousands of lives , and perhaps the future of the Mid<l>dIe East , are being determined by the actions of the allied and Iraqi forces .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #76:4>
There is an inevitable tendency for media and pub<l>lic opinion to veer dramatically from day to day .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #77:4>
The euphoria which greeted the news that early air attacks had penetrated Iraq with minimal losses has given way to deep fears about the consequences of Baghdad 's firing of missiles at Israel .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #78:4>
The principal test of the days to come - for politi<l>cians , the media , the public - will be to keep our collective nerve and maintain a sense of balance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #79:4>
This is easier said than done when , as W.F. Deedes points out on this page , we possess so little reliable informa<l>tion about what is happening .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #80:4>
Neither we nor , almost certainly , President Bush and Mr Major know how much of Iraq 's armoury remains intact , the extent of Saddam Hussein 's capacity still to impede the allied ground forces , and how many of his chemical and biological weapons have escaped destruction .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #81:4>
It is the nature of the fog of war that such doubts exist .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #82:4>
Yet the clearest signs from the past 48 hours are that the allied air forces continue to be able to attack the full range of vital targets in Iraq with only minimal losses .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #83:4>
It may be that Saddam 's strategy is based upon declining to commit most of his forces to meet these attacks , in the hope of keeping as much as possible of his artillery and air force in being , for later use .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #84:4>
Yet it is hard to believe that this attempt is likely to be success<l>ful against the weight of bombardment directed against Iraqi facilities and the high level of target intelligence the allies seem to possess .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #85:4>
Fears about an attack on Israel deadly enough to force an Israeli response must persist .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #86:4>
There will be a continuing trickle of sad news about casualties , and possibly even about successful Iraqi missile strikes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #87:4>
But there seems no reason to doubt that the balance of advantage will remain with the allied forces .
<ICE-GB:W2E-005 #88:4>
Their commanders , who have looked assured on our screens since their offensive was launched , have seen nothing yet to threaten their confi<l>dence - or our own in them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #1:1>
Voters make all kinds of marks
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #2:1>
JOHN MAJOR 's coolness under fire seemed to desert him momentarily yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #3:1>
Commenting on the outcome of the Ribble Valley by-election , which proved another stunning upset for the Government , the Prime Minister dismissed it &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #4:1>
it had merely been another by-election in which the Liberal Democrats had been the convenient dustbin for the protest vote .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #5:1>
Though used no doubt to steady his own ranks , this was hardly the most measured statement and its slight will be remembered by many of the protesters when next they are in the polling booth .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #6:1>
It may have been an uncharacteristic slip by Mr Major , but it served to emphasise the spectacular nature of the Ribble result and the gravity of its implications .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #7:1>
Asked what were the three main issues of the contest , one voter replied : &ldquo; The poll tax , the poll tax and the poll tax . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #8:1>
That , indeed , seemed to be the case .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #9:1>
Nothing else appeared to intrude : no Gulf factor , no Major factor -
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #10:1>
Tory supporters simply wanted to tell the Government to bury the community charge .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #11:1>
And they did so by deserting in their thousands to the Liberal Democrats &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #12:1>
and they were joined there by Labour voters seeing a chance to cause an upset .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #13:1>
Both sets of transients achieved the result they wanted and thus provided problems for the parties they consider to be their normal homes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #14:1>
Mr Major expects his dissidents to return at the election but there is a big perhaps .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #15:1>
That will happen only if the Government manages to replace the poll tax with a more acceptable alternative .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #16:1>
On that front , time is running out , in relation to the local elections in England in May and to the general election whenever it is called .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #17:1>
The position is further complicated by those in the Tory Party who think a return to a property tax would be the final betrayal of Mrs Thatcher .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #18:1>
There is , therefore , the potential for a serious split in the party over the issue .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #19:1>
For Labour the implications are hardly more encouraging .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #20:1>
True , it would not have expected to win Ribble , the fourteenth safest Tory seat in the country , nor would such a victory be essential to a general election win .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #21:1>
But the performance of Paddy Ashdown 's troops must send quivers of alarm into every corner of the party 's headquarters in Walworth Road .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #22:1>
The 24 per cent swing from Tory to Liberal Democrat will give the latter 's supporters a tremendous charge , the effect of which will still be evident come the election .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #23:1>
It could be strong enough , in short , to deprive Labour - which has to win the 230 seats in which Mr Ashdown 's party are in second place if it is to regain power - of victory .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #24:1>
His successful candidate , Mike Carr , is probably right when he says that the Ribble result will bury the poll tax &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #25:1>
Labour 's worry is that , in the longer run , it might also bury its electoral chances as well .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #26:2>
Galleries in the dark
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #27:2>
IT IS perhaps inevitable that the Scottish Arts Council should be held responsible for the fact that art galleries in Edinburgh have been closing at an alarming rate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #28:2>
As the main source of funding for the Fruitmarket Gallery , and as a substantial backer of the 369 Gallery , the council is the obvious target for protests when these galleries get into financial difficulties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #29:2>
The campaign mounted to save them is concerned not only with the immediate problem but also with the lack of what it sees as a long-term policy for the visual arts in Scotland , inadequate funding , and an absence of &ldquo; accountability and democracy in the administration of present funding and policy . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #30:2>
These questions will be addressed at a public meeting in the Traverse Theatre on Monday .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #31:2>
The SAC 's chairman , Sir Alan Peacock , has made clear that it will not attend that debate but the council is hoping that future consultations will provide &ldquo; a constructive forum &rdquo; for discussing visual arts policy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #32:2>
Meanwhile the most constructive thing which the council can do is to ensure that the Fruitmarket Gallery reopens in the near future , and is not left boarded up , while the gallery 's re-structured management wrestles with its financial and administrative problems .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #33:2>
There are signs that the owners of the property , Edinburgh District Council , may be prepared to reduce the rent from a realistic to nominal level , and it is hoped that &ldquo; caretakers &rdquo; can be installed to hold exhibitions there in the summer , and particularly during the Festival .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #34:2>
If ever a gallery suffered from a combination of low attendances and insufficient sales then it has been the Fruitmarket .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #35:2>
The 369 Gallery in the Cowgate , by contrast , has been much more successful at selling art and generally serving artistic and educational interests .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #36:2>
Its problems , nevertheless , are more complicated than those of the Fruitmarket .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #37:2>
The Scottish Arts Council has not withdrawn support for it , but is waiting for the board to decide what is to happen to the property .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #38:2>
The SAC should support any efforts to retain the educational aspects , and to provide artists with all the facilities they require .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #39:2>
This would not conflict with any plans to set up a commercial gallery under the same roof .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #40:2>
In the &ldquo; Lower Depths &rdquo; of Edinburgh , where the 369 is situated , the district council is anxious to promote as much artistic activity as possible , and the Scottish Arts Council should continue to co-operate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #41:3>
Paper warriors
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #42:3>
THE story is told of a war correspondent ( no , not that war ) who was privileged to file his story with an opening sentence which ran something like this : &ldquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #43:3>
I narrowly escaped with my life today as enemy sniper fire whipped into the trench where I lay doggo with our brave lads . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #44:3>
His fortunate escape , from which much mileage was milked , caused great rejoicing back at the office .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #45:3>
Curiously , however , other newspapers with correspondents at the front line seemed slightly miffed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #46:3>
One reporter received the memorable if ungrammatical telegram : &ldquo; Daily Bugle shot at .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #47:3>
Why you not shot at ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #48:3>
It is this deep pool of competitive skirmishing and one-upmanship into which the independent broadcasting regulatory body was asked to dip its toe yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #49:3>
The Sunday Post had complained about a television commercial promoting the new Sunday Scot .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #50:3>
In particular , it objected to its own readers being portrayed as dusty , shuffling old men holding copies of the Sunday Past .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #51:3>
The popular end of the newspaper market has never been noted for modesty and sensitivity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #52:3>
Generally , however , the tabloids tend to keep their arguments in the family , preferring to score points off each other in their own columns - probably to the mystification of their readers - rather than call in an independent umpire .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #53:3>
The tabloid wars in Scotland recently produced a ludicrous and entirely harmless little spat .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #54:3>
Tabloid A plucked at its readers ' heart-strings by announcing that it was going to extradite an abused donkey from Spain .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #55:3>
Tabloid B clearly wished it had thought of this first .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #56:3>
It then claimed it had achieved custody of the hapless quadruped and faked up a photograph , giving its donkey the same name as the editor-in-chief of Tabloid A .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #57:3>
But it 's when the happy little game strays into the field of advertising that hackles are bound to rise .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #58:3>
Before the case went to the broadcasting referees , both sides had apparently considered some kind of legal action .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #59:3>
Luckily , our Lords of Session were spared .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #60:3>
The case of Sunday Past v Sunday Skit might have tested their patience just a little .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #61:4>
The final test of allied aims
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #62:4>
ALTHOUGH it is of course too early to tell for certain , the land war seems to have begun well for the allies .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #63:4>
The stories filtering back through the news blackout speak of Iraqis surrendering in large numbers , light resistance to tank assaults , and columns heading north across the Kuwaiti border at speed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #64:4>
The accounts given by the first prisoners ( including two improbably surrendering to The Scotsman ) seem to bear out the suggestion that the massive bombardment of Iraqi positions has taken its toll over the past few weeks .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #65:4>
If progress is maintained , we might , just might , be contemplating a short war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #66:4>
The commander-in-chief of the coalition forces , General Schwarzkopf , sounded exceedingly upbeat at his briefing yesterday , but he was right to remind everyone that this is only the start of the campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #67:4>
It is conceivable that Iraqi resistance will crumble and that the action will come to a rapid end .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #68:4>
But by past experience it is wiser to be cautious .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #69:4>
At the start of military action in January some assessments were considerably more optimistic about the speed with which the bombing would lead to the collapse of Iraq than in fact turned out to be the case .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #70:4>
Now , too , the US and other soldiers may begin to meet stiffer resistance and greater difficulties as they move beyond the Iraqi front-lines and as the supply links begin to stretch .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #71:4>
However , as the fighting progresses it is important that the politicians should not lose sight of the war aims as circumscribed by the relevant UN Security Council resolutions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #72:4>
They are to liberate Kuwait and not to occupy Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #73:4>
If and when the resistance of the occupation forces falters and fails and Iraq lies open to the coalition troops , the temptation to keep moving must be resisted .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #74:4>
After the promising start of concerted UN action to deter the aggression against the emirate , the world body is in danger of being seen increasingly as an appendage of the US state department .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #75:4>
If the UN is to retain its credibility the coalition must adhere strictly to its mandate , and not allow military security considerations to have the final say .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #76:4>
The comments emanating yesterday from Moscow in the wake of its collapsed peace plan emphasise the point .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #77:4>
The Soviets expressed regret that a real chance to solve the conflict by peaceful means - &ldquo; to achieve the goals set out by the UN Security Council resolutions without further human casualties and material destruction &rdquo; - had been missed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #78:4>
Historians in the future may argue about whether Saddam Hussein was merely playing games to gain time or whether President Bush threw away the chance of a settlement in his eagerness to inflict a crushing defeat on the Iraqi leader .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #79:4>
The stage when that was still a relevant consideration has now been passed and it looks likely that the war will end only when Baghdad 's forces have surrendered .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #80:4>
The real test of allied aims comes at that point .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #81:4>
The sight of an Arab power being attacked and defeated by other Arabs in league with western forces could leave a lasting legacy of bitterness in the minds of Iraq 's sympathisers and neutral countries sceptical about western intentions in the Middle East .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #82:4>
Furthermore , a distinction must be made between Arab governments friendly to the West and sections of their population , which see the downfall of the Iraqi regime as the work of US imperialism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #83:4>
The suffering which Saddam has imposed on fellow Arabs in Kuwait - and , indeed , on his own population - would be dismissed by them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #84:4>
The political damage may be limited if the fighting is over relatively quickly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #85:4>
But if too much is taken for granted , too many humiliations visited on Iraq and its people , defeat for Saddam Hussein might easily turn into a victory for him among Arab public opinion .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #86:5>
Fighting recession
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #87:5>
THERE is good news and there is bad news in the latest Fraser of Allander medium-term economic forecast for The Scotsman .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #88:5>
The good news is that the downturn will be shallower in Scotland than the recession of the early 1980s or that experienced in the southern part of the United Kingdom .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #89:5>
Growth , it appears , is likely to resume in the second half of 1991 and hold steady into the middle of the decade .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #90:5>
But the bad news is that the initial impact on jobs is likely to be severe - 26,000 this year , according to the model - and it could take until 1994-1995 to recover 1990 employment levels .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #91:5>
These figures largely exclude the &ldquo; peace dividend &rdquo; job losses &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #92:5>
over 100,000 Scottish jobs depend on defence , and the FAI forecast estimates that 8-12,000 could go .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #93:5>
There is a need to understand now how to minimise the effect of recession , and to prepare for its end .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #94:5>
It will produce significant shifts in the labour market - from heavier to lighter manufacturing , from manufacturing to service industries , from full-time to part-time working .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #95:5>
The main focus of economic planning should be on meeting the medium-term impact of the recession , particularly on employment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #96:5>
Logically , since the effects will vary widely across Scotland , the new Local Enterprise Companies should be a useful mechanism for this .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #97:5>
It is all the more lamentable , therefore , that their budgets , particularly on the training side , are being so savagely squeezed in this of all years .
<ICE-GB:W2E-006 #98:5>
The downturn may have medium-term impact , but planning should always be carried out with an eye on the long-term .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #1:1>
Keeping cool while the war hots up
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #2:1>
TEN DAYS into the Gulf War and the British are once again learning what it is like to man the home front .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #3:1>
For the first few days it was easy , at least for those without friends and relatives among the fighting forces , to suppose that we were little more than spectators .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #4:1>
The technical brilliance of mod<l>ern television seemed to promise that we would be able to follow this war almost as closely as the allied generals who were planning it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #5:1>
Watching Patriot missiles rush into the night sky to explode and destroy the Iraqi Scuds was like taking part in a brilliant computer game .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #6:1>
The dangers of the media enchantment that enveloped the early stages of the war were revealed when the allied operation began to have its downs as well as ups .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #7:1>
This was nothing to surprise the professional soldier .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #8:1>
The public , though , had been confused by hopeful assur<l>ances that the war would not be drawn out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #9:1>
Unfortunately , the televi<l>sion screen that brought us the action so vividly and with such speed encouraged unreal expectations about the length of the conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #10:1>
Neither blanket television coverage nor 24-hours-a-day radio news is well suited to reporting events that drag on , let alone a war with no clear time limit .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #11:1>
Ten days into the war and we are learning that the first duty of those on the home front is to show patience .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #12:1>
Soldiers know that war is mostly boredom inter<l>spersed with moments of terror and sublime relief .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #13:1>
On the home front , tolerance of boredom is laced with anguish for the casualties ( like the bruised pilots dis<l>played on Iraqi television or the Israeli and Arab victims of Scud missiles ) and flashes of relief when the news from the front is good .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #14:1>
And we are learning yet another necessary lesson .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #15:1>
The media coverage of the first days ' fighting was so overwhelming that we for<l>got that it was very far from complete .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #16:1>
This is not to cri<l>ticise the the many brave and competent men and women among the journalists in the Gulf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #17:1>
Nevertheless , instant television coverage and rapid transmission of news<l>paper correspondents ' sto<l>ries represent immediacy , not completeness .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #18:1>
Cable News Network pulled off a remarkable coup in Bagh<l>dad , but its pictures from the Iraqi capital risked knocking our judgment off balance by providing such vivid cover<l>age of what in fact was only a fraction of the initial air war against Saddam Hussein .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #19:1>
Reporters with the allied forces are also limited in their movements and the material they can send home .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #20:1>
The Gulf will not be like Vietnam , where an enterprising correspondent could talk or bluff his way almost anywhere in the country , and even pay visits to Vietnamese Communist forces .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #21:1>
We are now beginning to understand how misplaced is the sense of omniscience we get from watching the action on our television screens .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #22:1>
Like those on the home front in earlier wars we shall often be imperfectly informed of what is happening , and this too puts our patience to the test .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #23:1>
Soldiers have to cope with the fog of war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #24:1>
The home front has to learn to live with the partiality of real information about that war : not so much fog as a void .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #25:1>
Patience is also called for if those at home are to appreci<l>ate the extent to which this war is being fought in two different dimensions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #26:1>
Mr Douglas Hurd 's visit to Paris last week was a commend<l>able first step towards Euro<l>pean contingency planning for the peace , but our atten<l>tion and emotions are natu<l>rally chiefly engaged in the military operations and the anticipated casualties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #27:1>
For Saddam Hussein , however , this war is above all a politi<l>cal act .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #28:1>
The Allies have gone to war reluctantly and against their preference .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #29:1>
Mr John Major 's statements have expressed very well this mood of regret , with a wel<l>come lack of triumphalism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #30:1>
To accuse Saddam Hussein of being a monster ( which he is , and chiefly towards his own people ) is to miss the point of his quite different approach to the fighting .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #31:1>
Though he does not deserve to , he has struck a note in the Arab world to which we must pay heed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #32:1>
The Iraqi dictator is bene<l>fiting from decades of Arab frustration : frustration at Arabs ' inability to co-oper<l>ate , let alone unite &semi; frustra<l>tion at the West 's lack of interest in a Palestinian solu<l>tion &semi; frustration at the West 's continuing ability , decades after the disappear<l>ance of formal colonial rule , to dominate the region .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #33:1>
Much has been said in recent days about the West 's own unthinking help to Iraq by sales of weapons .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #34:1>
But the frustration of an Arab world for which nothing is more disastrous than a war of Arab against Arab has been of immeasurably greater help to Saddam , and the West bears its share of responsibil<l>ity for that too .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #35:1>
The home front has a duty here .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #36:1>
Those who stay at home are often more tempted by revenge than those who have to fight .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #37:1>
It would be inexcusable if we did not use the weeks of war ahead to make it plain , not least to ourselves , that our enemy is Saddam Hussein , not the Iraqi people and still less the Arabs .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #38:2>
A stark choice that can't be avoided
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #39:2>
&lsquo; WE PASS the brink at mid<l>night , 15 January . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #40:2>
Those were the blunt words of the American Secretary of State , James Baker , to the air crews poised to launch the first strikes against Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #41:2>
What he did not tell them - what neither he nor anyone else can know - is whether the order to release the rockets will come this week , next week or , one still hopes with diminishing confidence , never .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #42:2>
The deadline was an arbi<l>trary device , sought by Washington to bring matters to a head and is now serving that purpose only too well .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #43:2>
There are many people , on both sides of the Atlantic , who wish it could have been different .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #44:2>
Sanctions were only just beginning to bite .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #45:2>
A country of 19 million people was never going to be able to sustain an army of a million , equipped with such sophisti<l>cated weaponry , without any foreign revenues at all .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #46:2>
In time sanctions were bound to succeed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #47:2>
For all its attractions , however , the grim truth is that the sanctions route is no longer open .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #48:2>
For the Ameri<l>cans , the time required was simply not available .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #49:2>
There was also a case for relieving the suffering Kuwaitis sooner rather than later .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #50:2>
Only now has it become clear that sanctions were effectively abandoned as the main line of international policy last autumn , when the Americans massively increased the build-up of forces and persuaded the UN to impose the deadline for withdrawal .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #51:2>
The Labour Party , among others , has not faced up to this reality .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #52:2>
The outlook now contains two unpalatable elements .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #53:2>
One is a war of potentially horrific dimensions which , even if it liberates Kuwait or destroys Saddam Hussein , will be seen by much of the Arab world as a victory for US imperialism , poisoning relations with the West for another generation and creating an unpredictable and possibly no less danger<l>ous regional landscape .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #54:2>
Peace would leave Saddam in place to go on destabilis<l>ing the Middle East and endangering the world 's oil supplies .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #55:2>
It is no good now , with the deadline for hostilities just two days ahead , wishing like the man from Tipperary that the journey had started somewhere else .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #56:2>
Sanctions may still have their uses if there is a partial withdrawal or half-hearted negotiations , but the real option has nar<l>rowed to a stark and early choice between peace and war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #57:2>
That choice is up to Saddam Hussein .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #58:2>
Unless he withdraws from Kuwait , the allies have no choice but to drive him out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #59:2>
It is still too early to despair .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #60:2>
The UN Secretary-General , Javier Perez de Cuellar , is in Baghdad with a list of peace proposals .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #61:2>
A general security conference for the whole Middle East that took in the Palestine question , discussed a reduc<l>tion of weapons on all sides and led to an American with<l>drawal in favour of UN and Arab forces , is no mean offer .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #62:2>
It would enable Sad<l>dam to extricate himself from Kuwait while claiming to have changed the map of the Middle East for the ben<l>efit of all Arabs .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #63:2>
It could even lead to more perma<l>nent moves towards a regional peace agreement .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #64:2>
Of course there are many obstacles to such a plan .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #65:2>
Israel would not accept it easily , especially if Saddam survives intact .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #66:2>
And who can blame them ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #67:2>
The Americans will not countenance linkage or any solution that enables Saddam to claim a victory .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #68:2>
But the one hope for peace to emerge last week was America 's apparent readi<l>ness to allow others to bro<l>ker a deal that would not seek to punish Saddam per<l>sonally .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #69:2>
Total withdrawal is the sine qua non :
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #70:2>
after that there is much that is open to discussion .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #71:2>
Will Saddam Hussein see it that way ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #72:2>
Those who believe that , underneath , he is a cool calculator rather than a mad dreamer , think he will , though he may hag<l>gle about concessions to the last .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #73:2>
Hence the optimism being expressed by the Alge<l>rians , Jordanians and those close to the UN Secretary-General .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #74:2>
Behind even some of the Western rhetoric , hardened by the need to keep up the psycho<l>logical pressure , is an under<l>standing that Saddam Hussein 's style is to go just beyond the wire but then to embrace the unacceptable if his own survival dictates it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #75:2>
But what if he refuses ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #76:2>
For peace you need trust , and for a leader so fearful for his own safety the dangers of withdrawal may be too great to accept .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #77:2>
Even if he does , he may wish to push it well beyond the deadline , for rea<l>sons of pride as much as any<l>thing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #78:2>
In that case , the talking must be allowed to go on .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #79:2>
The hawks may find that hard to swallow .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #80:2>
The military may feel it makes their job more difficult .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #81:2>
But the stakes are too high not to let President Mitterrand fly to Baghdad and the Arabs to try one last push , if there is a serious chance of success .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #82:2>
If Saddam does in the end refuse to withdraw , the allies have no options left .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #83:2>
This century has already shown that there are times when right demands might , and this will be one of them .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #84:2>
Sad<l>dam cannot be allowed to get away with this aggression .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #85:2>
He has a good offer on the table .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #86:2>
If he does not take it , the rockets of justice will have to fly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #87:3>
Putting justice to rights
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #88:3>
WITH the release of the Birmingham Six , what Lord Den<l>ning once called &lsquo; an appalling vista &rsquo; has become plain fact .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #89:3>
As Master of Rolls in 1980 , he justified his dismissal of the men 's civil damages claim for assault in terms of the havoc it would cause if they were to win .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #90:3>
Their victory , he said , &lsquo; will mean the police were guilty of perjury , that they were guilty of violence and threats , that the confessions were erroneous &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #91:3>
The consequences would be such that every sensible person would say : &lsquo; It cannot be right that these actions should go any further . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #92:3>
In moving swiftly to appoint a Royal Commission , the Home Secretary appears to appreciate the seismic scale of the blow to the judicial system .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #93:3>
Crown lawyers tried to the last to treat the convictions of the Birmingham Six like a curate 's egg : good in parts .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #94:3>
Their performance , coupled with the record of the judges detailed elsewhere by Chris Mullin , has undermined the public 's faith in British justice .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #95:3>
It is right that Mr Baker has chosen the vehicle of a Royal Commission to do the necessary work of examining the structures of that justice so that the fundamental issues of adversarial or inquistorial methods be considered in detachment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #96:3>
But as Lord Runciman and his colleagues deliberate , the Home Secretary must take other , immediate steps to restore confidence .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #97:3>
On Friday , Mr Baker justified his relaxed timescale by referring to the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act , claiming it meant that a repetition of the case of the Six was already virtually impossible .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #98:3>
Yet the next cause c&eacute;l&egrave;br waiting in the wings of the Appeal Court , that of the three men convicted of killing PC Blakelock in the Tottenham riot , bears a disturbing resemblance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-007 #99:3>
Like the Six , their convictions rest on uncorroborated and disputed confessions , but PC Blakelock was killed a year after Pace received the Royal assent .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #1:1>
United in disarray
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #2:1>
THE Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are unlikely to appreciate the irony of their situation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #3:1>
But after 40 years , during which they pursued resolutely separate paths towards socialism , they now find events in their countries converging on a broad front .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #4:1>
The main common factor all along has been that both were federa<l>tions containing ancient hostilities within their boundaries .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #5:1>
But other shared influences nowadays include a deteriorating economic performance , a highly centralised government , and the presence of one historically dominant republic which has the federal capital in its midst .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #6:1>
Obviously , such parallels can be stretched too far .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #7:1>
The disturbances in both capitals at the weekend had marked differences :
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #8:1>
in Belgrade the protesters were demonstrating against the Com<l>munist domination by Mr Slobodan Milosevic , President of the Serbian republic , while in Moscow the protests were in favour of the leader of the Russian republic , Mr Boris Yeltsin .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #9:1>
But both were symptoms of nationwide disarray which is calling into question the survival of the two states .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #10:1>
Last week , it was possible to assume that Mr Gorbachev would emerge as victor in his referendum on Sunday through which he will seek to secure the future of the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #11:1>
The phrasing of his question to voters refers tenden<l>tiously to a renewed federation of &ldquo; equal sovereign republics &rdquo; , but with the Russian republic accounting for half the total population of the union , equality is scarcely possible .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #12:1>
Indeed six of the republics , which feel themselves to be equal only in their powerlessness beneath Moscow 's yoke , have refused to hold the referendum although , perver<l>sely , this step will have the effect of increasing Mr Gorbachev 's chances of victory .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #13:1>
But in any case , their electorates are too small to have stood much chance of influencing the outcome .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #14:1>
However the demonstration on behalf of Mr Yeltsin in Moscow on Sunday which seems to have attracted about half a million supporters , shows the degree of disaffection in the heart of the union even before most of the people in the crowd had heard details of the doom-la<l>den economic forecast from Gosplan , the central planning agency .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #15:1>
Given that the present dissension in the union has arisen partly from a decline of three per cent in gross national product during 1990 , the prospect of a decline during 1991 of 11.6 per cent threatens to take the country to the edge of the abyss .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #16:1>
For this is a country which is not only unaccus<l>tomed to the swings and roundabouts of boom and recession , but it is also going into a catastrophic slide from a starting<l->point of empty shops , queues and reduced living standards .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #17:1>
Though the economic plight of Yugo<l>slavia is less acute , growth during the 1980s was almost flat , and there is pronounced inequality between the republics .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #18:1>
Earnings in the prosperous north are roughly twice what they are in Kosovo towards the South .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #19:1>
Neverthe<l>less , as in the Soviet Union , there appears still to be a residual loyalty to the idea of a federation , albeit without the Communists , without the Serbian-dominated army , and without the vio<l>lence .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #20:1>
In both cases , the weaker repub<l>lics are aware of their need for a watertight umbrella , while the stronger will want to negotiate a measure of extra independence .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #21:1>
For both federations , therefore , the eventual outcome could be a two-tier structure , on the very lines which were scorned in Brussels last year at a time when Britain was feeling the same need for elbow-room within the EC as the Baltic republics feel within the Soviet Union .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #22:1>
In the meantime , Mr Gorbachev might achieve greater respect if he dropped the pretence that his republics would enjoy equality - let alone sovereignty .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #23:2>
Unhappy landings
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #24:2>
THERE was a time during the 1970s when the buses in West Yorkshire carried an advertisement for an indepen<l>dent airline which read : &ldquo; Fly via Schiphol , London 's third airport . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #25:2>
The slogan might be worth reviving now that another independent airline , flying from Humberside , has jibbed at the extra landing charges at Heathrow , and has boosted its traffic to the Dutch airport by 60 per cent .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #26:2>
For long-distance travellers heading east or south , the connections with the KLM airline make Schiphol an attractive option .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #27:2>
In the long run , this is the kind of competition which might prevent the British Airports Authority from pursu<l>ing a greedy policy of pricing out of Heathrow all but the biggest and most crowded of the long-haul jets .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #28:2>
In the short term , however , any such policy could lead to a great deal of inconven<l>ience for those who are travelling overseas and want connecting feeder flights which serve their regional air<l>ports .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #29:2>
Feeder flights , however , tend to use small aircraft , and small aircraft are more vulnerable to exotic increases in landing charges at Heathrow .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #30:2>
Twenty-six per cent is the figure that will take effect , appropriately , on April 1 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #31:2>
Taking the long view again , it might be an advantage to Britain if Heathrow lost some of its reputation as the prime starting-point for all foreign travel - a cachet which used to be enjoyed by Victoria Station in the days when something called the Golden Arrow was hauled by something called a steam engine .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #32:2>
Gatwick has always been too far on the wrong side of London to be useful to people from most parts of Britain , but after Stansted Airport has been officially opened by the Queen this week , and has brought first-class air travel to the north-east side of London , the balance might be redressed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #33:2>
And to judge by the photographs , Stansted might even be a pleasure to use .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #34:2>
But as long as present traffic patterns persist , Heathrow is likely to remain substantially the preserve of British Airways which holds almost 40 per cent of the landing slots there .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #35:2>
And now that the wrangle over the transatlantic flights by TWA and PanAm has been resolved , it will probably remain the normal starting point for New York , just as Victoria was for Paris .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #36:2>
Try as one might , it is hard to foresee the day when membership of the EC eclipses the need to travel occasionally to the United States &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #37:2>
equally , it is hard to deny that it would be inconvenient if Yorkshire people were obliged to fly to New York by way of Schiphol .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #38:2>
It follows , therefore , that Heathrow is likely to hold a near-monopoly of flights westward .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #39:2>
Given that the Government is mili<l>tantly opposed to monopolies - to the extent that it has just negotiated rights for a second British airline to fly to the US - it would surely not wish to see all this traffic funnelled into the maw of a single , rather greedy airport .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #40:2>
And if the airport were to be unhappy at the prospect of being obliged by political pressures to abandon such a lucrative hold on the transatlantic services , all it has to do is defuse the argument by allowing a reasonable ratio of feeder flights from the regions , at reasonable cost .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #41:2>
The only remaining problem will be that it may take several years before the logic of this situation triumphs over the desire to make a quick profit .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #42:3>
No concessions
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #43:3>
VISITORS to Hong Kong would testify that the colony needs a new airport .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #44:3>
While the descent to Kai Tak runway is picturesque - by which one means that the incoming airliner squeezes through a corridor of flats and tenements , afford<l>ing excellent interior views of kitchens and their occupants - Hong Kong is much in need of a large new inter<l>national airport in keeping with its status as one of the Pacific 's commercial and industrial capitals .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #45:3>
Recognising this need , the Govern<l>ment announced plans to create a new airport and to improve the port .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #46:3>
The cost of the project was to have been about &pound-sign;9,000m , with much of the money coming from the private sector .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #47:3>
This investment was intended to provide the infrastruc<l>ture necessary to Hong Kong 's contin<l>ued economic development .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #48:3>
It was also intended as a confidence-building mea<l>sure , a pledge that the people of Hong Kong were assured a happy and pro<l>sperous future even after the colony reverted to mainland China in 1997 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #49:3>
It had been assumed that develop<l>ments of this sort would please the government in Beijing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #50:3>
The most encouraging features of the Sino-British accord of 1984 was China 's acknowledg<l>ment that Hong Kong 's economic well<l>being was vital to the future of the republic .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #51:3>
This was the reason why the Communists offered a one-country-two-systems arrangement that would have allowed Hong Kong to retain its capita<l>list structures for the next half century .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #52:3>
Seven years on , the Chinese are sud<l>denly objecting to the plans for the new airport .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #53:3>
By Beijing 's calculation , the project is too costly .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #54:3>
It would deplete Hong Kong 's reserves .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #55:3>
Although this objection could be disregarded , on the very good grounds that what happens in Hong Kong between now and 1997 is none of China 's business , Beijing 's displeasure amounts to a substantial veto .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #56:3>
Financiers are unlikely to flock to a project that has all the makings of an international dispute .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #57:3>
The prime purpose of the Foreign Secretary 's trip to Beijing last week was to resolve this thorny problem and to seek an improvement in relations between Britain and China .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #58:3>
These worthy aims perhaps explain why Mr Douglas Hurd was prepared to go to China in the first place , there to shake hands with some of the Chinese leaders directly implicated in the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #59:3>
The trip appears to have been a failure .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #60:3>
Although negotiations are continuing , the Chinese have not relaxed their opposition to a new airport .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #61:3>
In effect , they are demand<l>ing the right to interfere in Hong Kong 's affairs long before sovereignty passes to Beijing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #62:3>
This is a depressing development that is certain to further undermine confi<l>dence in Hong Kong .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #63:3>
Many thousands of the colony 's ablest and brightest young business people have already emigrated , unable to imagine a future as subjects of the authorities in Beijing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #64:3>
Many others in Hong Kong have acquired foreign passports , knowing that they can leave at a moment 's notice .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #65:3>
Although the rest of the world seems prepared to forget the bloodshed in Beijing , the event retains much of its horror and proximity for the people of Hong Kong .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #66:3>
The Chinese are making no attempt to court the colony .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #67:3>
Any talk of democratic development is interpreted by Beijing as being either subversive or slanderous , and it begins to look as if the aged clique of Chinese Communists would quite happily sacrifice Hong Kong 's economic riches if it enabled them to cling to power without renewed challenge from dissidents and supporters of democracy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #68:3>
The arguments are fully understood in Beijing :
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #69:3>
it is just that they are being wilfully disregarded .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #70:4>
While Europe waits
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #71:4>
AGREEMENTS about the next step forward for Europe have a habit of &ldquo; emerging &rdquo; , in much the same mys<l>terious way that leaders of the Conserva<l>tive party used to &ldquo; emerge &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #72:4>
In the case of the Tories , the process produced a great deal of suspicion and was therefore abandoned in favour of majority voting &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #73:4>
in the case of Europe , the process produces delays , but the EC is not ready for majority voting on financial issues , so compromises have to be tried for size until one achieves unanimity .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #74:4>
There is therefore no cause for alarm because Europe 's finance ministers failed to agree yesterday on founding a central bank to handle the Community 's transition towards a single currency .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #75:4>
As far back as last October , Britain voiced its dissent to the idea of creating a European central bank as a kind of hollow receptacle into which the Euro<l>pean currency would eventually be placed .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #76:4>
But now the Danes , the Germans and the Dutch are also having second thoughts about setting up such a bank before the 12 economies in the EC have achieved greater &ldquo; convergence &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #77:4>
This is a magnificently imprecise term , intended to drown the shuffling of a great many cold feet . .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #78:4>
In the confident days when the Single European Act was approved , it was possible to think in terms of structuring a European cur<l>rency around the rock-solid Deutsch<l>mark .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #79:4>
But today the Deutschmark is no longer looking such a solid foundation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #80:4>
Indeed Chancellor Kohl clearly has his own doubts , resulting from the soaring costs of German unification .
<ICE-GB:W2E-008 #81:4>
He has recently indicated that he will not submerge the D-mark into a European currency until there is a more democra<l>tic control over the EC as a whole .

Now let Irish government act
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #2:1>
AFTER the atrocious killing by human bombs of British soldiers in Ulster , the task of identifying the murderers begins .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #3:1>
We have surely now arrived at a turning point in relations between Britain and Eire .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #4:1>
Following a series of failures by the Irish government and courts to go through with the process of catching , prosecuting and punishing IRA criminals , this must surely be the last chance to show that the South really means to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement work .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #5:1>
If this vile outrage cannot stir it into action , what can ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #6:1>
The Garda appear eager to help , though their resources are inadequate .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #7:1>
The one thing now lacking is the political will .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #8:1>
And the deficiency seems to be greatest at the top - in the Irish Prime Minister Charles James Haughey himself .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #9:2>
Exporters love EC
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #10:2>
A LARGE majority of British Export firms are , according to a new survey , in favour of adopting both a common European currency and the proposed European Social Charter .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #11:2>
It is perhaps not so surprising that exporters should enthuse about being freed from the ups and downs and the extra costs of doing business in Marks , Francs , Lira and so on , because that would make their job easier .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #12:2>
But one might expect them to be more cautious about the Charter , which calls both for a minimum wage and workers on the board .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #13:2>
Perhaps they welcome the Charter because they fear undercutting by low-wage countries in the Mediterra<l>nean .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #14:2>
Certainly the high social charges imposed by the Charter would blunt the competitive edge of such econo<l>mies .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #15:2>
But they would also add to British wage costs and make us less competitive both in Europe and against America and Japan .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #16:2>
The impression the survey gives , how<l>ever , is that our exporters will readily put up with these disadvantages because they believe that a united Europe is inevitable and that on balance it is better to be fully inside it than out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #17:2>
It is a view that the Prime Minister would do well to note .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #18:3>
Embarrassing
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #19:3>
IN STRASBOURG , meanwhile , the European Court of Human Rights - which , by the way , has nothing to do with the Common Market - has ruled that sex criminals cannot be held in jail indefinitely on the Home Secretary 's say so .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #20:3>
This may be correct according to natural law , but it does not accord too well with commonsense .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #21:3>
In a number of cases , freed rapists unable to control their sexual urges have repeated their crimes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #22:3>
These show the need for the Home Secretary to have a discretion<l>ary power to protect members of the public .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #23:3>
Appointing a judicial commit<l>tee to do this job , as the Strasbourg Judges demand , would not work as effectively , as some recent major errors of the Court of Appeal underline .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #24:3>
How will this embarrassing confronta<l>tion end ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #25:3>
Britain accepts the jurisdic<l>tion of Strasbourg in principle but is not ultimately bound by it as it is , for instance , by the Rome Treaty .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #26:3>
It is to be hoped that some way will be found of fudging the issue and that we shall carry on much as before .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #27:4>
Those who won't ask don't get
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #28:4>
WHEN the call to war came , Britain was ready .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #29:4>
No other ally of the United States has committed so many of its fighting men and so much of its armour to the international campaign to free Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #30:4>
From the start , our forces have marched shoulder to shoul<l>der with those of America .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #31:4>
But when it comes to rattling the collecting tin , the Bush administration has left Her Majesty 's Government standing .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #32:4>
Since September , the only remaining superpower on earth has not been ashamed to knock on every friendly front door to demand substantial contributions to its war chest .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #33:4>
And , by heck , how the money - or at least the promissory notes - have rolled in : $32 billion from Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and other Gulf states &semi; $11 bil<l>lion from Japan &semi; $5 from Germany ( announced yesterday ) .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #34:4>
Unfortunately , Margaret Thatcher , Prime Minister in the early months of the crisis , could not bring herself to ask for cash .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #35:4>
Though she could wield her handbag to great effect in the tussle over European farm payments , maybe she considered it demeaning to pass round the hat to foreigners on behalf of a British war effort .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #36:4>
Whatever the reason , the result has been only too predictable .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #37:4>
For every &pound-sign;1 the United States has so far been offered , Britain has been promised a little over 1p .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #38:4>
On that side of the Atlantic they count their receipts in billions ,
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #39:4>
on this side we have been fobbed off with millions .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #40:4>
This won't do .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #41:4>
And , belatedly , John Major and his Ministers have woken up to the fact .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #42:4>
They have begun to realise that modesty will get them exceedingly modest returns .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #43:4>
So now the aim is to secure from other countries an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of that netted by the American Treasury .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #44:4>
We would be wet behind the ears to imagine that the United States - running a gargantuan Budget deficit - will willingly pass on to us , with an avuncular &lsquo; Aw shucks &rsquo; , wadges of the folding it is now holding .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #45:4>
We are going to have to conduct our own fund-rais<l>ing campaign .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #46:4>
Today , the Foreign Secretary , Douglas Hurd , will call on the Germans .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #47:4>
Clearly , they have been stung by criticism of their ineffectual role to date in the conflict .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #48:4>
Although their constitution may forbid them to fight in the Gulf , it does not prevent them from putting their hand into their pocket .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #49:4>
This they are at last doing on behalf of the United States and Israel .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #50:4>
They should do the same , specifically , for Britain 's desert army .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #51:4>
Countries like Germany and Japan , so dependent on oil supplies from the Middle East , have a vested interest as well as a global duty to finance those in the front-line of the offensive to drive the Iraqi army of occupation out of Kuwait .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #52:4>
Indeed , the ruling family of Kuwait itself - enviably rich in overseas investments - should surely reward right royally all governments ( that of Britain prominent among them ) which have forces ranged against Saddam .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #53:4>
The cause is just .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #54:4>
The costs must be fairly shared .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #55:5>
A better way of taxing
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #56:5>
POLL TAX is dead ,
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #57:5>
long live the coun<l>cil tax !
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #58:5>
The Government now seems to be on the way to avoiding the traps into which the new property<l->based local tax could easily fall .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #59:5>
The system of valuing the properties in broad bands should make assess<l>ment straightforward .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #60:5>
By giving re<l>bates to single occupiers and adding no more for multiple occupation it has dodged the need to have a regis<l>ter .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #61:5>
Collection should therefore be easy and cheap .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #62:5>
A welcome innovation is the vital ac<l>countability clause .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #63:5>
By this , profligate councils will have to raise their prop<l>erty levy to pay for any overspending but this will go up by the same pro<l>portion for every band and should be seen by most people as fair .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #64:5>
This arrangement should go a long way to meet the need to bring home to electors the price they pay for council extravagance .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #65:6>
Storming home
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #66:6>
THE original intention of the U.S. mil<l>itary was that General Schwarzkopf , the commander of the allied forces in the Gulf , should have a quiet home<l>coming .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #67:6>
Probably this was because it was thought inappropriate to stage a vic<l>tory celebration at a time when so many Kurds were dying .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #68:6>
That , how<l>ever , is not the way the American public saw it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #69:6>
They wanted a con<l>quering hero 's welcome with bands playing plus the usual razzamatazz .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #70:6>
The instincts of the American public were sound .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #71:6>
The allied victory in the Gulf war was real and General Schwarzkopf and his forces performed their task successfully with minimum casualties .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #72:6>
They fulfilled the prime war aims of freeing Kuwait and elim<l>inating the threat of Iraqi aggression against her neighbours and the rest of the world .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #73:6>
The decision to stop early what had become a turkey shoot was a laudable attempt to avoid further unnecessary slaughter .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #74:6>
General Schwarzkopf claims that continuing the fighting a few days longer would have made no difference to the fate of the Kurds , whose rebellion was put down by Iraqi troops held back from the front .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #75:6>
The problem of establishing stability in the region remains .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #76:6>
It was never go<l>ing to be easy because the allies do not want a permanent military com<l>mitment or a neo-colonial role in Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #77:6>
Yesterday 's muted ceremony in Tampa , Florida and the pageantry to come , including a tickertape welcome in New York , are therefore justified .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #78:6>
We all have much for which to thank General Schwarzkopf .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #79:6>
Although the tasks of creating a dura<l>ble peace in the Gulf are still with us , they would be much greater but for the brilliant feats of allied forces under his command .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #80:7>
Simple truth
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #81:7>
IN this age of the microchip all sorts of gadgets have been invented , such as microwaves , video recorders and fax machines which were supposed to make life easier .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #82:7>
Yet , because the makers have been trying to pack in so many extra facilities , many have become fiendishly complicated .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #83:7>
As a result their sales are sliding and serve them right .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #84:7>
The machine must serve the customer , not the other way round .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #85:8>
Mr Heseltine spells it out
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #86:8>
AT LAST we have details of the re<l>placement of the ill-fated poll tax .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #87:8>
On the face of it , there is much to com<l>mend .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #88:8>
It has avoided the complexity of its predecessor .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #89:8>
It is a single tax , apparently easy to calculate per household .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #90:8>
The collecting cost should be low , though valuing every house in the country will not be cheap .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #91:8>
The tax is also pitched at a reasonable level .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #92:8>
Nobody should find it crushing , as some found both the poll tax and the rates .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #93:8>
The range of payment bands , from two-thirds to two and a half times the average , seems fair .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #94:8>
The fact that rebates can rise up to 100 per cent for those who can't af<l>ford it avoids the poll tax problem of expensively chasing small amounts .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #95:8>
As for the structure of local govern<l>ment , we still do not have the details , which are to be left to a commission to sort out .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #96:8>
This is wise .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #97:8>
The Govern<l>ment is still keen to move towards one<l->tier authorities to improve accounta<l>bility , which is fudged when spending is shared .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #98:8>
But there is no clear rule , applicable everywhere , about whether power should ideally reside in district , county , county borough or metropoli<l>tan borough .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #99:8>
The changes are to be discussed with those most involved .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #100:8>
It is good that the Labour Party , though opposed to the new tax , is willing to discuss the proposed author<l>ities .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #101:8>
So at least the revised shape of local government , if not its finances , should have a chance to endure .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #102:9>
Sanctions must go
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #103:9>
THE South African government is now preparing to scrap the last laws allow<l>ing for racial segregation in the uni<l>versities .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #104:9>
It is a further milestone down the road towards complete aboli<l>tion of apartheid .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #105:9>
With racial discrimination largely end<l>ed , President de Klerk yesterday told our businessmen that it is time to remove remaining barriers to invest<l>ment .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #106:9>
His claim was fully justified .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #107:9>
In any case , the economic sanctions did most harm to the blacks .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #108:9>
South Africa needs to grow at 6 per cent or more a year if black unemployment is not to rise but that will not happen without an influx of capital from the outside world .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #109:9>
Happily the sanctions are withering .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #110:9>
Spurred on by Britain , the European Community recently dropped its em<l>bargoes on investment and on imports of South African coal , steel and gold coins .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #111:9>
Commonwealth ministers are expected to recommend the easing of sporting restrictions next month and there are high hopes that South Af<l>rica will be allowed to compete in the 1994 Olympics .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #112:9>
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 's visit later this year , perhaps followed by one by Mr Major , should be a further indication of the republic 's return to the comity of nations .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #113:9>
Meanwhile Mr de Klerk 's government can itself make some further useful changes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #114:9>
Its high protectionist tariffs should be lifted and its business de<l->regulated .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #115:9>
The large state sector should be privatised , the proceeds go<l>ing to the black population either in the form of schools and hospitals or distributed as shares .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #116:9>
This would fos<l>ter a truly free enterprise economy in which the blacks would have a vested interest .
<ICE-GB:W2E-009 #117:9>
It would be good for democracy and for personal freedom .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #1:1>
A president adrift
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #2:1>
GEORGE BUSH has reached the water<l>shed of his presidency , both in domestic and foreign affairs .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #3:1>
The decisions he takes in the next few weeks will define his place in the history books .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #4:1>
With almost 200,000 troops broiling in the Saudi Arabian desert , Washington paralysed by a budget crisis and the econ<l>omy tottering on the verge of recession , America 's 41st president will need all the resolve and wisdom he can muster .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #5:1>
His recent record has not been encouraging .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #6:1>
It is not only a question of appearances , degrading though it is for the American government to be currently operating on a five-day emergency loan , like a semi-bank<l>rupt cement factory .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #7:1>
The doubts go to the heart of the Bush administration , to the character of the president himself .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #8:1>
Bush has become indecisive , and at times down<l>right incompetent .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #9:1>
As a result , he has allowed events to career out of his control .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #10:1>
The Washington shorthand for this is that Bush has emerged in his true colours as a wimp - an old label from his days as vice president .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #11:1>
On a personal level , this is slander :
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #12:1>
nobody who flew 58 bombing mis<l>sions over Japanese territory in the South Pacific during the second world war de<l>serves to be called a wimp .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #13:1>
But as political analysis it is justified .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #14:1>
Of course , the American presidency is , constitutionally , a very weak office .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #15:1>
Any president faced with a Congress controlled by the opposition party , as Bush is , risks being reduced to impotence if he allows himself to be pushed around .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #16:1>
The only way to rule eff<l>ectively in these circumstances , as Ronald Reagan repeatedly showed , is to appeal to the public over the head of Congress , with a clearly-defined set of presidential goals .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #17:1>
If Capitol Hill thinks the American people are behind the White House , it will soon buckle under .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #18:1>
Bush 's problem is that he does not have a clear set of goals on his domestic or foreign agendas .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #19:1>
The fear is that he is rudderless because he has no guiding principles - that all he really stands for is Old Money , Brooks Brothers suits and a vague sense of noblesse oblige .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #20:1>
Consistency and clarity were the essen<l>tial features of the president 's Gulf policy when he ordered 250,000 men into Saudi Arabia two months ago .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #21:1>
They seemed to have clear orders : to confront , and if nec<l>essary destroy , Saddam Hussein 's military machine .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #22:1>
This is no longer the case .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #23:1>
Conflicting signals are now emerging from the Bush administration , whose Gulf pol<l>icy seems to have descended into drift and dither .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #24:1>
Last week in Dallas , Mr Bush called Saddam &ldquo; Hitler revisited &rdquo; , and raised the prospect of Nuremberg-style war trials for the Iraqi leader and his cronies .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #25:1>
But on the same day in London , Mr Bush 's defence secretary , Richard Cheney , gave the opp<l>osite message :
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #26:1>
American troops , he said , could be in Saudi Arabia for years , reject<l>ing speculation about a military attack on Iraq .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #27:1>
James Baker , the secretary of state , told Congress the same thing :
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #28:1>
&ldquo; Some may urge action simply for the state of action , but the only truly effective action we can take now is to continue Iraq 's diplomatic , economic and military isolation . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #29:1>
Senior administration sources say the president 's aim is now containment of Saddam , not confrontation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #30:1>
If so , Bush had better stop talking about Hitler and start explaining exactly how containment would work .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #31:1>
Iraq has the world 's fourth largest mili<l>tary machine .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #32:1>
Within five years , it will probably be able to launch intermediate<l->range ballistic missiles with chemical and nuclear warheads which could threaten central and southern Europe .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #33:1>
It is not clear how Mr Bush 's current strategy would con<l>tain that .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #34:1>
A start would be Iraq 's uncondi<l>tional withdrawal from Kuwait , with no payoffs &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #35:1>
that could topple Saddam by coup .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #36:1>
But suggestions that Saddam be given cash compensation , an oilfield or an island , would only encourage future extor<l>tion &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #37:1>
and even unconditional withdrawal is not enough .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #38:1>
If Saddam 's military machine is not de<l>stroyed by war , it must be steadily emas<l>culated by other means .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #39:1>
This should involve maintaining military and eco<l>nomic sanctions against Iraq , even after it withdraws from Kuwait , until Saddam agrees to destroy his chemical and nuclear weapons programmes .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #40:1>
Such a step would require intrusive verification .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #41:1>
It is , of course , far-fetched to think that any of this can be achieved without war .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #42:1>
But the momentum has gone out of America 's anti-Saddam crusade , and the Bush administration 's statements on the Gulf grow increasingly far-fetched .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #43:1>
At home , Mr Bush is also determined to fudge reality , for the fundamental reason that he will not decide whether or not he is a Reaganite .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #44:1>
If he is , he must stand up for low taxation , deregulation and cuts in government spending .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #45:1>
If he is not - and most Republicans think he isn't - he must give some substance to his so-far empty rhetoric about a &ldquo; kinder and gentler &rdquo; America .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #46:1>
At the moment , Bush is me<l>andering in a bog of pragmatism .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #47:1>
He has abandoned his &ldquo; no new taxes &rdquo; campaign pledge , but made little attempt to explain to the American people why such a fun<l>damental departure from Reaganomics was necessary .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #48:1>
No wonder his budget went down to a backbench revolt by Reaganite congressmen .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #49:1>
Some sort of budget deal will no doubt be cobbled together - it always is - but an even greater danger is looming for Bush : recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #50:1>
Like Britain , America is entering an eco<l>nomic downturn after a long period of expansion .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #51:1>
The danger is that in America a normal cyclical recession could turn into a full-blown depression .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #52:1>
Corporate debt has reached levels not seen since the end of the 1920s and the banks are stuffed full of bad loans .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #53:1>
The Federal Reserve Bank has warned Mr Bush that a severe recession could bankrupt hundreds of big banks and businesses .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #54:1>
A full-blown financial collapse of the kind last seen in the 1930s is not out of the question according to some doomsters .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #55:1>
Two years ago , when Bush was running for the White House , such warnings seemed exaggerated .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #56:1>
They may still be &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #57:1>
but most Americans are now more worried about their country 's economy than they have been for two decades .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #58:1>
According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll last week , 79% think their country is &ldquo; pretty seriously off on the wrong track &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #59:1>
Resolve in the Gulf and determined leadership on the budget and the economy could still make Mr Bush the president nobody ever really thought he could be .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #60:1>
The jury is still out , but not for long .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #61:1>
Your move , Mr President .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #62:2>
Over to Major
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #63:2>
WISE Tories should be relieved that their party lost the Monmouth by-election :
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #64:2>
the defeat has killed off any lingering tempta<l>tion in John Major 's mind to call a June election .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #65:2>
The prime minister is anxious to be his own man , and feels he cannot be until he has won his own mandate in a general election .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #66:2>
But June would have been an absurd risk for him to take , since Lab<l>our would most probably have emerged with the largest number of seats in the House of Commons , perhaps even with a small overall majority .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #67:2>
So Mr Major will have to be patient , and use the time to demonstrate that he is his own man by showing who is really in charge of eco<l>nomic policy .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #68:2>
The prime minister should disprove Labour 's smear that he is a ditherer by smashing the cosy conspiracy of com<l>placency which has developed between the Treasury and the Bank of England to keep the economy mired in recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #69:2>
That means overruling his chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England to force a decisive cut in interest rates .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #70:2>
If he fails to act now , it could cost him the election whenever it is called .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #71:2>
With Norman Lamont cooing breath<l>lessly in support , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , the bank 's governor , has moved to the centre stage of economic policy-making by arguing publicly that , despite Friday 's dra<l>matic fall in the headline inflation rate , there should be no further cuts in interest rates until the underlying rate of inflation begins to tumble .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #72:2>
In any case , say both men from ivory towers far removed from what is actually going on in the real econ<l>omy , the worst of the recession is already over &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #73:2>
the good times are just around the corner .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #74:2>
Both arguments are wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #75:2>
Interest rates did not soar in Britain because the underlying inflation rate shot up &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #76:2>
they rose in response to the increase in the headline retail price index .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #77:2>
Now that is falling , the chancellor and the governor want to change the goalposts .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #78:2>
They should not be allowed to get away with it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #79:2>
Real interest rates in Britain are on a par with those in France and Germany .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #80:2>
But infla<l>tion there is set to rise &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #81:2>
in Britain it is falling .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #82:2>
That is reason enough for another cut in interest rates .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #83:2>
The nonsense about underlying inflation rates is another .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #84:2>
Underlying inflation , around 6.7% by the widely respected measure devised by The Sunday Times , remains stubbornly high because of past rises in the RPI and because industry is in recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #85:2>
Pay deals are being struck to reflect recent double<l->digit inflation &semi; yet productivity is falling because the economy 's output is slumping .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #86:2>
The result is that unit labour costs are up by more than 10% , which keeps underlying inflation high .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #87:2>
A cut in interest rates would quickly work its magic on the RPI through reductions in the mortgage rate &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #88:2>
it would also help pull the economy out of the slump .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #89:2>
A lower RPI and a growing econ<l>omy would soon have unit labour costs tumbling , and along with them the under<l>lying rate of inflation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #90:2>
If the chancellor and the governor are serious about tackling inflation , they should be cutting interest rates now .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #91:2>
The greater danger is that they believe their own economic forecasts : that things are already on the mend .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #92:2>
On past perfor<l>mance that would be a great mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #93:2>
A year ago , when Mr Major presented his first ( 1990 ) budget , the Treasury forecast that Britain 's economy would grow by 1 1/2% in the year to mid-1991 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #94:2>
Even last December Mr Lamont was still talking of &ldquo; a fairly shallow downturn &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #95:2>
But when he came to present his first budget last March , the Treasury was by then estimating that the economy would actually decline by 3% by mid-1991 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #96:2>
This 4 1/2% forecasting error on the course of the economy is massive by anybody 's reckoning .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #97:2>
Yet Mr Lamont still blithely predicts the economy will grow by 2% between mid-1991 and mid-1992 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #98:2>
As long as interest rates remain at 12% no<l>body can take such a forecast seriously .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #99:2>
Common sense , the evidence of shattered company profits , factory closures and the statistics themselves all suggest that the economy , which has been falling since last July , is still pointing downwards .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #100:2>
Last month 's 84,100 rise in unemploy<l>ment , the largest April increase on record , underlined the depth of the recession .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #101:2>
So , too , did the latest official investment fig<l>ures for the first quarter , down 20% on a year earlier .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #102:2>
Mr Lamont clumsily observed that the sharply rising jobless total was &ldquo; a price well worth paying &rdquo; for getting infla<l>tion down .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #103:2>
Hundreds of thousands of Tory-inclined voters who now find them<l>selves unemployed , however , do not understand why they are paying the price for the government 's own economic in<l>competence .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #104:2>
The voters in Monmouth showed what they are prepared to do about it .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #105:2>
The government needs to deliver clear signs of economic recovery before it can risk the verdict of the nation .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #106:2>
On present policies it will run out of time .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #107:2>
Bank base rates , at 12% , are as high as they were in the autumn of 1988 , the height of the boom .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #108:2>
But economic conditions could hardly be more different .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #109:2>
Money supply growth is weak , the housing market is flat , unemployment is rising rapidly and wage settlements are falling .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #110:2>
Treasury-Bank of England fears of a resurgence in inflation are mistaken .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #111:2>
Do they not remember the economy 's recovery from the slump of the early 1980s ?
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #112:2>
Between autumn 1981 and autumn 1982 , base rates almost halved from 16% to 9% .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #113:2>
Yet infla<l>tion fell to less than 4% in time for the 1983 election .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #114:2>
The inflation fall now in prospect reflects the interest rate squeeze of 1989-90 .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #115:2>
Maintaining high interest rates pro<l>longs the pain for no gain .
<ICE-GB:W2E-010 #116:2>
Moreover , the nearer we get to the election the more the interplay of recession and weak Tory sup<l>port will weigh down on sterling and make interest rate cuts difficult .

8
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #2:1>
There was a thick rubber lifebelt clamped round his chest , constricting his breathing when it ought to have helped and then the pumping started again , the dark throbbing of an oily engine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #3:1>
He was almost underwater , deep in the bilges of a leaking ship and the storm outside was increasing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #4:1>
He could see gaps in the timbers that should have protected him and through them the sea appeared like a monster 's icy rolling green eye .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #5:1>
Then the ship lurched up out of the trough and glistening bright light crashed in upon him through the bars .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #6:1>
Beyond him in the sky was Clamp floating like a cloud , his legs spread and his face calm and serene as if in death , but before he could call him , the ship bucketed again into the deep ocean and there were sharks battering at the wreck to reach him - white sharks , their smooth heads ramming forward and their sudden jaws gaping .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #7:1>
Fragments of flesh hung from their mouths and a haze of pink tinted the water .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #8:1>
Their pig eyes were red and unseeing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #9:1>
&lsquo; But I 'm your master , &rsquo; he tried to explain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #10:1>
The sharks were unheeding because blood was darkening the water and strands of black seaweed oozed from wounds in the sharks ' sides .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #11:1>
One of the timbers cracked and pinned his legs &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #12:1>
the engine beat frantically , urgently and his eyes opened on a bedroom of shadows .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #13:1>
The side of his bed was weighed down with his father 's bulk and his shoulder was being pumped up and down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #14:1>
&lsquo; I want words with you , you young bugger .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #15:1>
Get yourself downstairs , double-quick time . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #16:1>
The weight lifted and curtains scraped open .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #17:1>
His bedroom faced the works and sickly lamplight from the yard swilled into the room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #18:1>
His eyes winced against the glare but he managed to see the clock - just five AM .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #19:1>
What the hell was going on , he thought , but then his duvet was thrown back harshly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #20:1>
&lsquo; I said to get a move on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #21:1>
Downstairs ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #22:1>
He tumbled out of bed , pulling at his loose pyjama trousers , retying the cord .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #23:1>
It was cold and he went to grab his pullover , but his father pushed him round towards the door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #24:1>
He stumbled downstairs , conscious of heavy footsteps behind him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #25:1>
The kitchen fluorescent tube flickered and steadied , bringing cold , hard light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #26:1>
The fridge hummed and the smell of yesterday 's pie lingered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #27:1>
&lsquo; What 's up ? &rsquo; he managed to say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #28:1>
&lsquo; You can tell me . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #29:1>
Dad pointed at the table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #30:1>
Clamp 's collar , leash and muzzle lay there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #31:1>
&lsquo; He 's not gone , has he ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #32:1>
Brett gasped and rushed to the window .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #33:1>
No .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #34:1>
There was his dog , statuesque in the frozen night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #35:1>
The boy turned back , puzzled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #36:1>
&lsquo; I came home after a long shift . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #37:1>
Dad squatted by the gas fire , flicked a Swan Vesta and held it to the jets .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #38:1>
It popped into life , a blue flame as cold as the room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #39:1>
Brett shivered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #40:1>
Dad stood up stiffly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #41:1>
&lsquo; There 's another two hundred layoffs due after Christmas and I could be one of them , &rsquo; he said heavily , rubbing his fingers over his stubble , and turning back to the table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #42:1>
Now he was in the kitchen he didn't seem as impatient .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #43:1>
&lsquo; Still , that 's all beside the point , like as not .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #44:1>
I get home , as I said , to find your mother in tears , Cassie screeching on about Jack being dead and your dog being to blame and you well out of sight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #45:1>
I 've enough on my hands sorting out your bloody sister , so I leave you till morning .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #46:1>
She 'll not be so quick with her tongue again , I 'm thinking . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #47:1>
He bunched his fists remembering the way she 'd refused to back off , had insulted her mother and how he 'd given her a backhander just to shut her tongue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #48:1>
&lsquo; Don't tell me you heard nothing . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #49:1>
Of course he 'd heard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #50:1>
He 'd heard the shouts and shrieks , had heard Cassie running up the stairs and heard her banging on his door shouting out that he was a bloody murderer , but he was better off where he was , keeping a low profile .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #51:1>
&lsquo; Well , after I 've shown Cassie who 's who and what 's what and sorted out your mother , who only wants a bit of peace and quiet - not much to ask - I take a little nosey up the garden and what do I find ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #52:1>
He paused , strumming on the table with a thick finger .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #53:1>
&lsquo; Well , what do I find , Brett ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #54:1>
You tell me . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #55:1>
Brett swallowed , cleared his throat and forced out the words .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #56:1>
&lsquo; There was an accident .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #57:1>
Clamp killed Jack .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #58:1>
He 's in the sack in the loft . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #59:1>
&lsquo; An accident ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #60:1>
Dad 's voice was quiet , sounded reasonable as if he were considering the possibility for the first time , but then he shook his head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #61:1>
&lsquo; I don't believe in accidents - never have - not with lazy little sods like you around . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #62:1>
Brett opened his mouth to protest , but Dad raised his hand to stop him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #63:1>
&lsquo; You 'd better not , Brett .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #64:1>
You 're in deep enough already - no need to make it worse . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #65:1>
He picked up the muzzle suddenly and dangled it in front of his son .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #66:1>
&lsquo; What have you been up to with this then , eh ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #67:1>
It 's not bloody Meccano , you know . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #68:1>
&lsquo; It got dented .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #69:1>
I straightened it out , &rsquo; Brett said sulkily , warily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #70:1>
&lsquo; And what about this ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #71:1>
Dad threw the collar across the table at him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #72:1>
He clutched at it and his trousers slipped onto his hips .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #73:1>
Brett 's voice rose slightly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #74:1>
&lsquo; Clamp broke it , broke the chain . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #75:1>
&lsquo; Not the leash ring he didn't , &rsquo; Dad snarled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #76:1>
&lsquo; Take a good look .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #77:1>
You clipped him to the buckling ring , the identity disc ring -
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #78:1>
soft as putty , that is .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #79:1>
Your bloody carelessness cost me old Jack . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #80:1>
Brett looked down at the stiff cold collar , inspected the fittings .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #81:1>
Dad was right and his stomach felt like water .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #82:1>
&lsquo; And what about this muzzle then ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #83:1>
There 's another story there , isn't there ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #84:1>
Another bleeding cowboy stupidity . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #85:1>
&lsquo; Sorry Dad , &rsquo; Brett mumbled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #86:1>
&lsquo; I don't want to hear it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #87:1>
There 's no room for sorry out there , mate , and there 's no room here neither - not at your age . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #88:1>
Dad 's hands went to his belt buckle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #89:1>
&lsquo; It was a mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #90:1>
Anyone can make a mistake , &rsquo; Brett said desperately .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #91:1>
&lsquo; Mistakes have to be paid for . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #92:1>
The belt slipped out of its loops and hung like a snake from his father 's right fist .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #93:1>
&lsquo; I 'll not be hit for it , Brett muttered , his teeth clenching , fire rising to his cheeks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #94:1>
&lsquo; I 'm fourteen , almost fifteen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #95:1>
You can bloody well keep your hands off . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #96:1>
For a moment his father looked as though he would leap across the room at him , but then he seemed to steady himself with a huge effort of will .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #97:1>
&lsquo; You 'll bend over that table , lad , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #98:1>
&lsquo; You 'll take your punishment and we 'll say no more about it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #99:1>
&lsquo; I 'll bloody not . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #100:1>
Dad slowly rolled the belt round his wrist and pulled at the other end as if it were the old razor strop used in Perkins the barber 's down the road .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #101:1>
&lsquo; It 's not a ruddy pantomime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #102:1>
I 'm not playing oh no you 're not , oh yes you are games with you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #103:1>
The choice is yours .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #104:1>
You either take your medicine or you don't see that dog again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #105:1>
He goes straight into Sandover 's kennels and I 'll train him from there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #106:1>
Please yourself . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #107:1>
&lsquo; He 's my dog .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #108:1>
You gave him me . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #109:1>
&lsquo; Stop bleating .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #110:1>
Make your choice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #111:1>
Cassie 'd be over the moon if you let him go .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #112:1>
She thinks you 're cruel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #113:1>
That 's what she says all the time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #114:1>
It 'd be easier all round if he went .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #115:1>
There he is , watching what 's going off .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #116:1>
He 's not daft , but if you can't handle him properly , I will . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #117:1>
&lsquo; He wouldn't do as you say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #118:1>
He 's my dog . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #119:1>
&lsquo; He 's not exactly following the training I laid down for him , is he ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #120:1>
It 's all accidents and mistakes with you ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #121:1>
&lsquo; No it 's not , &rsquo; said Brett hotly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #122:1>
&lsquo; He 's coming on fine and you know it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #123:1>
I reckon you 're just scared of Sandover - scared you 're not doing what he says . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #124:1>
The belt whipped on the tabletop in a sudden crack of anger .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #125:1>
&lsquo; Shut it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #126:1>
Dad spat out the words .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #127:1>
&lsquo; You 'll not talk your way out of this one .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #128:1>
Make your decision before I make it for you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #129:1>
There was no real choice to be made , Brett knew .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #130:1>
If he had to suffer to keep Clamp , so be it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #131:1>
He managed to walk over to the table and lean over it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #132:1>
He would not cry and he would hold the anger inside himself so that his father would feel ashamed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #133:1>
&lsquo; Get on with it then , &rsquo; he said through gritted teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #134:1>
Crack !
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #135:1>
The belt smashed into the table by his side and his whole body flinched .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #136:1>
He whirled round to see his father casually hoisting his trousers and refitting his belt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #137:1>
&lsquo; Fair enough , lad , &rsquo; he said , smiling as if this had been his intention all along .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #138:1>
&lsquo; Point 's been made -
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #139:1>
no hard feelings and you 'll remember to follow instructions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #140:1>
Now I 'm off to bed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #141:1>
It 's time for you to put some clothes on and walk Clamp .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #142:1>
Give him a long run and lots of steak from now too . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #143:1>
Dad left the room , whistling a little through his teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #144:1>
He never let anyone win anything , Dad didn't , thought Brett .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #145:1>
He had to have the last word , be the boss , and Brett hated him for it , felt cheated of the pain and the righteous indignation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #146:1>
In a strange way , as Dad closed the door behind him , his father seemed the smaller man for leaving him so , as if he 'd ducked out at the last minute , couldn't take the responsibility of inflicting pain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #147:1>
Since Brett had been brought up to see physical suffering as a natural product of punishment , the lack of it now seemed to him to be a weakness and a cause for anger at the same time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #148:1>
All he could do was bottle the burning feeling tightly inside , stuff a cork in as hard as he could and then let the thin oozings of rage carry him out on the morning trail .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #149:1>
He needed only the shreds of feelings to carry him through the daily routine if he made Clamp the centre of his power to burst out of the contemptible bonds that his father had imposed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #150:1>
He stormed up the stairs and crashed the door behind him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #151:1>
At least he had his own bedroom where he could hide when the feelings hissed inside , bursting for release .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #152:1>
He leaned his forehead on the cold paintwork of his door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #153:1>
&lsquo; I couldn't sleep , &rsquo; Cassie said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #154:1>
He whirled round .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #155:1>
That was all he needed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #156:1>
Cassie was sitting on his bed , her face puffy in the grey light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #157:1>
He dragged in a deep breath , renewing his strength for the battle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #158:1>
There was no room for his sister 's pleading .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #159:1>
He stared at her , hostile .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #160:1>
&lsquo; You can get out , &rsquo; he grunted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #161:1>
&lsquo; I was worried about you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #162:1>
Brett didn't answer , just walked to the chair where his clothes were strewn .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #163:1>
&lsquo; I called through the door last night , but you didn't say anything . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #164:1>
Brett picked up his shirt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #165:1>
&lsquo; I 've got to take out the dog , &rsquo; he said as finally as he could .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #166:1>
&lsquo; Not stopping you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #167:1>
Cassie crouched forward , holding her arms tightly around her as if suffering from stomach pain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #168:1>
Mum sometimes sat like that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #169:1>
Brett pushed spiky fingers through his hair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #170:1>
&lsquo; Oh yeah -
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #171:1>
I 'm to do it in my pyjamas , am I ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #172:1>
Cassie sighed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #173:1>
She 'd expended her anger the previous night and felt too tired to argue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #174:1>
&lsquo; I told Dad what I thought last night , &rsquo; she said quietly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #175:1>
&lsquo; You must have heard . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #176:1>
&lsquo; Had my headphones on -
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #177:1>
didn't miss much . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #178:1>
He quickly pulled off his pyjama top and wriggled into shirt and jumper .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #179:1>
&lsquo; Besides he told me this morning . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #180:1>
&lsquo; Please , Brett , &rsquo; said Cassie , &lsquo; I hate it when you 're angry all the time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #181:1>
Mum worries about you and that dog .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #182:1>
You 'll only hurt yourself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #183:1>
For a moment his sister 's words seemed to touch him with a memory of another time , another existence when he had looked at the sky and the earth as warm and welcoming , a place of love and trust , but then he recognized the trap Cassie had laid , to emasculate him , to reduce him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-001 #184:1>
How could he be a man without his dog ?

Chapter Seventeen
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #2:1>
The Doorway
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #3:1>
&lsquo; I know , &rsquo; Sally said as they walked back towards Anne and Tommy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #4:1>
&lsquo; It hurts my head , and it 's fading fast , but I know what it all means . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #5:1>
Anne was sitting up and crushing a tearful Tommy to her bosom by the time Dave and Sally sat down next to her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #6:1>
Her head was buried in Tommy 's neck and she was weeping .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #7:1>
Both of them were covered in spatters of a clear substance that looked like Clearasil gel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #8:1>
Apparently , that and the doorway was all that was left of Bad Eddie and his beating heart dolly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #9:1>
Anne looked up when Sally touched her arm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #10:1>
Her face was puffy and red and she looked tired .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #11:1>
&lsquo; Was it you ? &rsquo; she asked suspiciously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #12:1>
Dave nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #13:1>
&lsquo; We got you away from Bad Eddie , if that 's what you mean , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #14:1>
&lsquo; And there 's no need to worry ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #15:1>
we 're on your side , &rsquo; he added .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #16:1>
&lsquo; I 'm Sally Harrison and this is Dave Carter , &rsquo; said Sally .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #17:1>
&lsquo; Your name is Anne Cousins .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #18:1>
We know that . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #19:1>
Anne didn't seem to be listening .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #20:1>
&lsquo; He tricked me , &rsquo; she said thickly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #21:1>
&lsquo; He made me promise to be his if he found Tommy and my husband . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #22:1>
&lsquo; We know , &rsquo; Sally said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #23:1>
&lsquo; We just got inside his head and looked at The Knowledge .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #24:1>
It 's okay ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #25:1>
you 're alright now and so is Tommy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #26:1>
&lsquo; Where are we ? &rsquo; Anne asked , sniffing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #27:1>
Her right hand nervously picked at Tommy 's shock of blond hair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #28:1>
&lsquo; It 's all different . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #29:1>
Dave gave her one of the moist tissues from the plastic dispenser .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #30:1>
&lsquo; The Limbo Side , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #31:1>
&lsquo; There are no people here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #32:1>
Or at least , there are not meant to be . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #33:1>
&lsquo; I came through the Ghost Train .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #34:1>
I was looklng for Tommy and Derek .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #35:1>
I thought I was in hell , &rsquo; Anne said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #36:1>
&lsquo; Fairly close , &rsquo; Sally said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #37:1>
&lsquo; But not quite . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #38:1>
&lsquo; Your husband is over here , too ? &rsquo; asked Dave , remembering their meeting with him in the park .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #39:1>
Derek was astute &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #40:1>
for all his jittery craziness , he 'd known what was going on long before Dave and Sally had .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #41:1>
Sorry , Derek ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #42:1>
things just didn't work out , Dave thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #43:1>
&lsquo; He vanished , &rsquo; Anne said , &lsquo; Just like Tommy did .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #44:1>
He said he was going to look for him , so I suppose he 's over here somewhere , unless ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #45:1>
Sally shook her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #46:1>
&lsquo; I knew about him , but it 's gone now , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #47:1>
&lsquo; It 's all fading . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #48:1>
&lsquo; We haven't seen him , &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #49:1>
&lsquo; Not since we were on the other side . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #50:1>
&lsquo; He must be here somewhere , &rsquo; Anne said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #51:1>
&lsquo; What are we going to do ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #52:1>
&lsquo; We 'll find him , &rsquo; Dave said , looking at Sally and then glancing at the darkening sky .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #53:1>
&lsquo; I want my d-daddy , &rsquo; Tommy sobbed without looking up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #54:1>
&lsquo; He is alive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #55:1>
He is ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #56:1>
&lsquo; Sure he is , Tiger , &rsquo; Sally said , &lsquo; and we 'll find him soon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #57:1>
But we 're going to have to do something else first &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #58:1>
time is running out . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #59:1>
Anne frowned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #60:1>
&lsquo; What do you mean ? &rsquo; she asked , sniffing , then dabbing her nose with the tissue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #61:1>
&lsquo; We 're in trouble , Anne , and 're going to have to do something soon or ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #62:1>
&lsquo; Or indeed , &rsquo; Dave said nodding sombrely .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #63:1>
&lsquo; Or what ? &rsquo; Anne said , looking from Dave to Sally and quickly back again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #64:1>
Dave noticed that she shared her jerky , nervous movements with her husband .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #65:1>
He 'd been like that when he 'd approached them outside the funfair that day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #66:1>
&lsquo; Or the Ultimate negative force of the universe is going to come crashing through from where it resides and change things forever , &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #67:1>
&lsquo; Or maybe a bit longer &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #68:1>
the details are a little hazy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #69:1>
Anne shook her head , not understanding .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #70:1>
&lsquo; Don't you know ? &rsquo; Sally asked her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #71:1>
&lsquo; Didn't you get The Knowledge ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #72:1>
Anne sighed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #73:1>
&lsquo; I didn't get anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #74:1>
Just pain and fear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #75:1>
I couldn't see inside his mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #76:1>
He dragged me back and forth across the town .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #77:1>
We only stopped once and I thought I was going to die of exhaustion . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #78:1>
She looked up at Dave , her eyes huge and brimming with tears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #79:1>
Hold on to her or something , Sal , Dave thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #80:1>
Comfort her for God 's sake .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #81:1>
I can't do it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #82:1>
He didn't know if Sally had heard him or not , but she went over to Anne and Tommy and encircled them with her arms .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #83:1>
`S'okay , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #84:1>
&lsquo; We 'll be all right . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #85:1>
Dave sat and looked up at the sky for what seemed like a long time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #86:1>
Tommy had fallen asleep by the time Anne had calmed down and she rocked him gently back and forth in her arms .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #87:1>
&lsquo; What 's going to happen ? &rsquo; she asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #88:1>
&lsquo; What 's going on ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #89:1>
Sally took her hand and squeezed it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #90:1>
&lsquo; I don't know if I can explain very well , but I 'll do my best , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #91:1>
&lsquo; I don't know about the rest of the universe ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #92:1>
it 's too confusing and it doesn't matter anyway , so I 'll just tell you what I 'm sure of .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #93:1>
Okay ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #94:1>
Anne nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #95:1>
&lsquo; Our world co-exists with two others , just like the Bible says .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #96:1>
Only the rest of it isn't very biblical at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #97:1>
This Limbo land - where we are now - doesn't figure in the Bible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #98:1>
As far as I can tell , Limbo is a feat of metaphysical engineering that holds the three together .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #99:1>
&lsquo; There is supposed to be a balance between the three sides - Earth Side , the Good Side and the Bad Side but something has gone wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #100:1>
The balance has been lost and the Bad Side is coming out on top .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #101:1>
There 's something from there that desperately wants to get in here and make this place its own .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #102:1>
It wants to do that because it can get to Earth Side - our world - from here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #103:1>
There have always been gaps through which it can exert its influence on our world and it likes to do this .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #104:1>
I don't know why .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #105:1>
It 's too big and too different for us to know why , but it does it and we can see the results . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #106:1>
&lsquo; And until now it could only do it in a small way , &rsquo; Dave added .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #107:1>
&lsquo; The bad things that happen are because of its weak influence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #108:1>
Tidal waves , hurricanes , people who go mad and run through towns blasting people with Kalashnikov rifles .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #109:1>
All the big disasters are caused by the negative influence that filters through from the Bad Side . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #110:1>
He frowned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #111:1>
&lsquo; I don't think the little things are though .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #112:1>
Are they , Sal ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #113:1>
&lsquo; It doesn't matter , &rsquo; Sally replied .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #114:1>
&lsquo; The point is this :
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #115:1>
Fred Purdue and his pals have opened up a passage between Limbo and our side , and the thing we 're up against wants to get through in a big way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #116:1>
Fred has stirred it up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #117:1>
Against all the cosmic rules and forces that are there to prevent interference , Fred has opened the way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #118:1>
He 's provided the bad thing with the negative energy it needs to get through . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #119:1>
&lsquo; But what does it want ? &rsquo; Anne said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #120:1>
&lsquo; Souls ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #121:1>
Does it want human souls ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #122:1>
Sally shook her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #123:1>
&lsquo; I think it wants to own everything ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #124:1>
it wants everything to be it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #125:1>
Bad Eddie said there are gaps in The Knowledge , and he was right ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #126:1>
there are gaps .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #127:1>
We 've seen them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #128:1>
Maybe it wants human souls , maybe it just wants to fill those gaps .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #129:1>
Whatever it wants , the results will be the same .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #130:1>
No more us .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #131:1>
No more birds singing in summer trees .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #132:1>
No more anything except absolute cold and absolute darkness . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #133:1>
&lsquo; And it 's going to achieve what it wants unless we stop it , &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #134:1>
&lsquo; There 's this thing called The Claw .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #135:1>
It 's some kind of an incarnation of the negative force .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #136:1>
It 's the owner of the Bad Side .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #137:1>
It 's after us because it wants these crosses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #138:1>
It seems to need them to get it through to the real world .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #139:1>
Sally and I were unlucky enough to buy them cheaply , &rsquo; he added sardonically .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #140:1>
&lsquo; But how can you stop it ? &rsquo; Anne said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #141:1>
&lsquo; If it 's an embodiment of everything evil , how will you stop it ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #142:1>
&lsquo; There are gaps in The Knowledge , that 's how , &rsquo; Sally said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #143:1>
&lsquo; The Claw is not omniscient , much as it would like us to believe it is .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #144:1>
It doesn't know everything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #145:1>
There are big confusing blanks in The Knowledge where we and the crosses are concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #146:1>
I think the crosses are from the Good Side .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #147:1>
They are powerful and it wants them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #148:1>
Badly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #149:1>
Like Dave said , the crosses are the key to its escape .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #150:1>
And we 're going to take them to it and see what happens . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #151:1>
&lsquo; We 're going through the door , &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #152:1>
&lsquo; The one that used to be Bad Eddie .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #153:1>
That 's what it 's there for , to go through . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #154:1>
&lsquo; But why are you going to take the crosses to it ? &rsquo; Anne said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #155:1>
Dave shrugged and gave her a wan smile .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #156:1>
&lsquo; It just feels right . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #157:1>
&lsquo; Don't you know what you 're doing ? &rsquo; Anne asked , horrified .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #158:1>
&lsquo; Not until we do it , &rsquo; Sally said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #159:1>
&lsquo; We don't exist in The Knowledge so we couldn't find out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #160:1>
We have to just follow our noses and hope .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #161:1>
All we do know is that we have to go over to the Bad Side and try and stop it before it comes over here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #162:1>
If it breaks through to this side , we 're sunk . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #163:1>
Tommy woke up and looked blearily at his mother .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #164:1>
&lsquo; Daddy 's coming , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #165:1>
Dave looked out over the blighted grass towards AdventureLand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #166:1>
A tall , upright figure dressed in blue denim was striding purposefully towards them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #167:1>
&lsquo; Roddy , &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #168:1>
&lsquo; Here 's Roddy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #169:1>
Roddy Johnson was carrying the body of a man across his shoulders , but he was moving easily as if the man weighed no more than a sailor 's kit bag .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #170:1>
&lsquo; Daddy ! &rsquo; Tommy cried excitedly , leaping from his mother 's lap and running down the bank towards Roddy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #171:1>
&lsquo; Tiger , wait ! &rsquo; Anne shouted , but the boy didn't stop .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #172:1>
&lsquo; What if he 's dead ? &rsquo; she moaned piteously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #173:1>
&lsquo; He 's alive , &rsquo; Sally said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #174:1>
&lsquo; Oh shit ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #175:1>
Dave swore as Tommy Cousins skidded to a halt in front of Roddy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #176:1>
Even from this distance he saw the boy go rigid .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #177:1>
&lsquo; Something 's wrong with Derek ! &rsquo; Anne wailed , getting to her feet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #178:1>
&lsquo; I knew it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #179:1>
He 's dead ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #180:1>
She swayed back and forth on the spot , her shoulders shuddering .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #181:1>
The Marks &ampersand; Spencer bag was once again clutched firmly in her right hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #182:1>
Not for the first time , Dave wondered what was inside .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #183:1>
&lsquo; No ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #184:1>
Tommy screamed , his cracked voice riding clearly through the still air .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #185:1>
&lsquo; No no no no NOOOO ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #186:1>
He turned away from Roddy and pressed his hands over his ears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #187:1>
Dave guessed his eyes were clamped shut , too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #188:1>
Roddy strode past Tommy , and Derek Cousins 's limp arms and legs waggled at the child as Roddy swaggered by .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #189:1>
&lsquo; Look at him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #190:1>
Look at him ! &rsquo; Anne screamed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #191:1>
&lsquo; He 's transparent !
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #192:1>
It 's happened to him too !
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #193:1>
Oh God , please ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #194:1>
&lsquo; He 's alright , &rsquo; Sally insisted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #195:1>
&lsquo; He 'll be okay , Anne .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #196:1>
Calm down ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #197:1>
She took the weeping woman in her arms once more while Dave caught Tommy and swept him from the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #198:1>
Tommy 's face was flushed and tearstained .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #199:1>
&lsquo; Okay Tiger , &rsquo; he said , as Roddy drew close .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #200:1>
&lsquo; Hiya , Foureyes , &rsquo; Roddy said , striding up the bank .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #201:1>
&lsquo; Long time no see . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #202:1>
He stopped in front of Dave and dumped Derek Cousins unceremoniously on the grass .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #203:1>
Dave had spotted the stain on the front of Roddy 's clothes as he had approached , but he 'd thought it was grease or dirt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #204:1>
The oval mark ran up from the tops of the legs of Roddy 's jeans and stopped just below his ribs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #205:1>
It was thickest and darkest around the front of his trousers and it could have been any kind of liquid .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #206:1>
But where it was crusted on his white tee shirt it was the dirty reddish-brown colour of dried blood .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #207:1>
&lsquo; What happened ? &rsquo; Dave said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #208:1>
Roddy cocked his head to one side and screwed his face up into a parody of concentration .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #209:1>
&lsquo; When exactly ? &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #210:1>
Dave pointed to the stain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #211:1>
&lsquo; Looks like blood , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #212:1>
&lsquo; Oh that , &rsquo; Roddy said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #213:1>
&lsquo; Cut myself didn't I ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #214:1>
He pulled up his shirt and showed Dave a thin scabbed line just below his navel that had obviously been made with his flick-knife .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #215:1>
He tapped his pocket and grinned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #216:1>
&lsquo; I was cleaning it and it went off , &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #217:1>
There 's no way it could have bled enough to make that huge mark , Dave thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #218:1>
But he didn't question Roddy about it any further .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #219:1>
Somehow , it didn't seem wise .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #220:1>
&lsquo; I brought you a present , &rsquo; Roddy said , digging Derek in the back with the toe of his boot .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #221:1>
&lsquo; But I see you 've got some presents of your own .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #222:1>
I thought you said your tart was in hospital , &rsquo; he added suspiciously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #223:1>
&lsquo; She got better , Roddy , &rsquo; Dave said , looking closely at Roddy 's face .
<ICE-GB:W2F-002 #224:1>
He was sweating , but there was something else different about him and Dave couldn't quite put his finger on what it was .

<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #1:1>
Monday 14 August
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #2:1>
Emma left the hotel car-park at seven-fifteen , two hours after she had left her bed , glad to be up and about in the early morning light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #3:1>
She had paid her bill and booked a room for the next day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #4:1>
Behind her , in the car , her bags were packed , soiled linen neatly on one side , the plastic wallet sandwiched between her toilet bag and her hairdrier .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #5:1>
She was going home to collect decent mourning clothes for the funeral and to see if the brooch did tally with the receipt , as she suspected .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #6:1>
But she wanted , needed , to see Lesley again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #7:1>
All night she had tossed and turned , dreaming sometimes of being at a disadvantage , afraid , and helpless to help herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #8:1>
In the dawn greyness she had listened to the birds ' first brave cheepings and had given way to her overpowering urge to confront Lesley once more .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #9:1>
&lsquo; To see if she is real , &rsquo; she thought , not comprehending why she should say something so foolish .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #10:1>
And now she was heading for Manchester and that executive des.res. with the untidy kitchen and immaculate study .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #11:1>
She switched on the radio , hoping for diversion , but the news was of the runner Steve Ovett and his tearful outburst of yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #12:1>
P. W. Botha , the South African premier , was to resign .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #13:1>
She tried to welcome the good news but it seemed not to matter on this dull , suffocating English day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #14:1>
Emma checked the dashboard clock .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #15:1>
If she wanted to catch Lesley en d&eacute;shabille she would have to be early , but not so early that she arrived before Keith left for SyStems .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #16:1>
She eased her foot on the accelerator and settled in her seat for a leisurely 120 miles to Manchester .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #17:1>
While the signs slipped by ... Scotch Corner , Wetherby , Leeds ... she thought about the brooch .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #18:1>
&pound-sign;480 : a fortune to a man with no job back in 1957 .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #19:1>
She tried to summon up the brooch , to remember what had made it so special .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #20:1>
It had to be the same one ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #21:1>
how many sheep-shaped brooches could there be ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #22:1>
And the stones , stuck on the sheep 's back like a saddle ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #23:1>
She had thought them paste , but if they were gems that would go some way to explaining the price .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #24:1>
She might be sitting on a valuable item .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #25:1>
It had cost John Gaunt the price of his house ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #26:1>
that was certain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #27:1>
The golden sheep - what had the receipt said ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #28:1>
A ewe<l->lamb - was beginning to take on intriguing proportions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #29:1>
Her father had commissioned it :
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #30:1>
that in itself was unusual .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #31:1>
It wasn't something you did every day , if ever ... unless you were the Duke of Windsor or Richard Burton .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #32:1>
Had it been a bribe to bring her mother back to the fold ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #33:1>
Was that the significance of the lamb ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #34:1>
If so , he must have loved her very much .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #35:1>
And her mother had kept it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #36:1>
She had never used it but she had kept it safe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #37:1>
Emma felt her eyes prick suddenly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #38:1>
How awful if they had really loved one another but been too proud to admit they were wrong and reunite .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #39:1>
By the time she reached the city outskirts she was feeling decidedly sentimental .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #40:1>
Perhaps she should stay away from Lesley today ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #41:1>
But in her heart of hearts she knew that if she did so she would regret it later on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #42:1>
Better to do it now and get it over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #43:1>
Then , when she had picked at her wound , she would treat herself to a hairdo and a good lunch to raise her morale before she saw Poppy and took out the sad clothes of mourning for another airing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #44:1>
When she was almost there she stopped at a corner newsagent to buy gifts : a glossy monthly for Lesley , a brightly coloured picture book for Tom , and a glass globe full of swirling snow for Zo&eumlaut; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #45:1>
Keith 's house looked the same , neat raw brick and everything utterly symmetrical .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #46:1>
It looked as though Mr Wet or Mrs Dry would pop out any moment to say the weather had changed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #47:1>
If only it would !
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #48:1>
When she released her seat-belt her dress clung wetly to the small of her back and her thighs burned from contact with the seat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #49:1>
She was sure that Lesley would be dressed this time , on top form and still euphoric about the return of her husband .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #50:1>
But it was the same waif-like figure that greeted her , this time with a whoop of joy and two skinny arms right around the visitor 's neck .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #51:1>
&lsquo; Come in ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #52:1>
come in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #53:1>
Tom , look who 's here ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #54:1>
Aunty Emma ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #55:1>
Lesley 's hair was caught back this time , fastened into a fuzzy turquoise holder , but the cotton nightie and wrapper were the same , the bare legs and feet with the chipped pink nails identical .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #56:1>
Tom appeared in Batman pyjamas , uncertain at first , looking to his mother to dictate the mood .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #57:1>
She nodded and smiled , pushing him forward to hold up his face for a kiss .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #58:1>
&lsquo; There now , you were wondering when Aunty Emma was coming back . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #59:1>
He turned suddenly and ran , to reappear a moment later with a bright yellow racing car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #60:1>
&lsquo; Brmm , brmm , &rsquo; he said , making swooping motions to simulate fast travel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #61:1>
&lsquo; You go into the lounge ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #62:1>
it 's sunnier there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #63:1>
I 'll bring coffee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #64:1>
Take Aunty Emma to see your garage , Tom ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #65:1>
there 's a good boy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #66:1>
There were cars strewn on the shag-pile carpet and the baby sat in a yellow high-chair , a soiled bib around her neck and traces of breakfast around her mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #67:1>
A half<l->filled mug of coffee stood in the hearth , beside an opened paperback , laid face down to keep the reader 's place .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #68:1>
Margaret Drabble 's The Radiant Way -
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #69:1>
so that was what Lesley read !
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #70:1>
But drinking coffee and reading in an undusted room , children and mother still in their night<l->clothes , the breakfast dishes undoubtedly unwashed in the sink if not still on the table - it was ... Emma sought for a civilized word ... sloppy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #71:1>
&lsquo; There now ... this is nice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #72:1>
Keith went ages ago .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #73:1>
He 's going in early while you 're away , and working all hours .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #74:1>
I hardly see him , except at weekends . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #75:1>
Lesley talked with animation , the restraint of their first meeting all gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #76:1>
&lsquo; She thinks we 're friends , &rsquo; Emma said to herself , and felt ashamed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #77:1>
&lsquo; Zo&eumlaut; seems fine , &rsquo; she said aloud .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #78:1>
As if she 'd heard , the baby started to whimper .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #79:1>
Lesley raised her eyes to heaven .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #80:1>
&lsquo; She 's probably hungry .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #81:1>
Let 's get our coffee while we can .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #82:1>
She never stops feeding ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #83:1>
still , I suppose it 's better than being picky . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #84:1>
So she was going to feed the baby .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #85:1>
Emma felt a quiver of excitement , of terror almost , the feeling you might get from probing delicately at a stitched wound , wondering if the sutures would hold or the flesh would gape suddenly , allowing the innards to spill forth in an endless , bloody stream .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #86:1>
The baby 's whimperings gathered strength and volume , and Lesley took a huge gulp of her coffee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #87:1>
&lsquo; Better get it over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #88:1>
She had egg and bacon breakfast and it seemed enough , but she wants some milk . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #89:1>
She stood up and began to extricate the baby from the chair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #90:1>
&lsquo; You don't mind , do you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #91:1>
She was slipping breast from cotton covering .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #92:1>
&lsquo; Only some people are so funny if you do it outside , and sometimes you can't help it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #93:1>
Keith says I shouldn't take any notice ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #94:1>
he says they 're only jealous ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #95:1>
Emma nodded , trying to take her eyes off the baby 's cheeks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #96:1>
In , out , in , out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #97:1>
Her ears sang with the pain of it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #98:1>
Clever Keith , finger right on the spot as usual .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #99:1>
Jealousy , that was what consumed her now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #100:1>
She gripped her cup and saucer , resisting the urge to raise her hand to her own breasts , to feel them swell and engorge , to take the baby from the usurper and clamp the questing mouth to her own nipple .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #101:1>
&lsquo; You like children , don't you ? &rsquo; Lesley said , smiling and pouring salt into the wound .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #102:1>
&lsquo; I don't know much about them really , &rsquo; Emma said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #103:1>
&lsquo; I 'm an only child , so I had no young brothers or sisters .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #104:1>
And we 're a small family , so no cousins either . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #105:1>
Suddenly she could hear her aunt 's voice :
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #106:1>
&lsquo; You 've got two cousins , our Billy and our Vera . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #107:1>
What a mess she was in ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #108:1>
what a labyrinth of lies and half-truths was closing around her , her own and those of a generation gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #109:1>
&lsquo; Poor thing , &rsquo; Lesley said sympathetically .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #110:1>
&lsquo; I 've got heaps of relations .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #111:1>
Too far away at the moment , but at least I know they 're there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #112:1>
Most of them came for Zo&eumlaut; 's christening .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #113:1>
I know Keith asked you , but you couldn't make it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #114:1>
The Doulton nursery set was lovely , though .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #115:1>
Too good to use .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #116:1>
It 's in the cabinet for when she grows up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #117:1>
&lsquo; I was in London that weekend , &rsquo; Emma said , &lsquo; or I 'd have been here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #118:1>
She lied easily this time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #119:1>
In fact she had spent the day between bed and bath , weeping
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #120:1>
The baby was falling asleep , its mouth going slack in concert with its drooping lids , then jumping into pump action again as the eyes snapped open .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #121:1>
Emma watched , fascinated , her coffee growing cold in her hand , until at last Lesley took her nipple between first and second fingers and removed it gently from the baby 's mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #122:1>
&lsquo; There now , &rsquo; she said , slipping the breast into hiding , rising smoothly to lay the baby down on the dralon settee and put a cushion alongside it as a prop .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #123:1>
&lsquo; She is dralon and shag-pile , &rsquo; Emma thought exultantly - her triumph turning to ashes as the girl 's face looked toward her , alight with friendship .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #124:1>
&lsquo; I 'm so glad we got to know each other , Emma .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #125:1>
It 's a pity poor little Zo&eumlaut; had to suffer to bring it about , but it 's an ill wind , isn't it ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #126:1>
Emma nodded and smiled as Lesley returned to her chair , curling her legs up and holding the toes of one foot in tiny , determined fingers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #127:1>
Had they fucked last night ... or this morning ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #128:1>
Did he wait until the baby was sated and then reach out ... ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #129:1>
&lsquo; You must be glad to have Keith back ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #130:1>
&lsquo; Oh yes . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #131:1>
Lesley pulled a little face .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #132:1>
&lsquo; It 's been like a second honeymoon ... and he 's been wonderful with Zo&eumlaut; . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #133:1>
&lsquo; She means to hurt me , &rsquo; Emma thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #134:1>
&lsquo; She must know it goes through me like a knife . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #135:1>
Aloud , she said : &lsquo; I don't know what it 's like to be husband-less but I can imagine . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #136:1>
Lesley tucked her hair behind her ear again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #137:1>
&lsquo; Forgive me for asking ... tell me if I 'm nosy and I 'll shut up ... but is there someone ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #138:1>
You 're so attractive ... &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #139:1>
&lsquo; There is someone , &rsquo; Emma said , keeping her voice as steady as she could .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #140:1>
&lsquo; Serious ? &rsquo; Lesley asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #141:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; Emma said , &lsquo; it 's serious .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #142:1>
He 's important to me , but how it will end I don't know .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #143:1>
It 's too early to say . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #144:1>
&lsquo; Is he nice ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #145:1>
&lsquo; Yes , he 's nice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #146:1>
Very like Keith in many ways . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #147:1>
This was dangerous but she couldn't help it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #148:1>
&lsquo; Oh ho , &rsquo; Lesley said . &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #149:1>
Hold on to him , then .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #150:1>
He 's worth having . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #151:1>
&lsquo; I mean to hold on to him , &rsquo; Emma said , and then , &lsquo; I have to go , I 'm afraid , &rsquo; she said abruptly , and got to her feet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #152:1>
In the car , Lesley 's quick kiss burning into her cheek , Emma let the tears come .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #153:1>
They were tears of fury , not at Keith for his duplicity or Lesley for her prior claim , but that she , Emma Gaunt , who had won a well-deserved reputation for competence , should allow herself to be swept , rudderless , towards the rapids that were surely waiting round the bend .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #154:1>
And should even paddle furiously to bring calamity nearer !
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #155:1>
In the beauty parlour she waited while they flicked through lists .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #156:1>
Yes , she could have her hair done at one by Michelle while Gina did her nails , and before that Velody could give her a cleanse and facial massage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #157:1>
She submitted to a pink gown and was laid on a paper-covered couch like a virgin prepared for ritual sacrifice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #158:1>
&lsquo; You 've got one or two pores , &rsquo; Velody said , bringing down the inspection light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-003 #159:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; said Emma in a penitential manner , and closed her eyes while her hair was bound back by a tissue band .

CHAPTER 4
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #20:1>
Does it really alter my appearance that much ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #21:1>
I wondered , staring at my shorn reflection in the hairdresser 's mirror .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #22:1>
If anything , it seemed to sharpen my features , reminding me how much I 'd hated the obligatory short back-and-sides while I was in the Army .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #23:1>
Ironic , since fashion has gone full-circle and kids actually ask to have their hair cut short now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #24:1>
I paid up and went back to the hotel to collect my bag and briefcase ( although the room was still reserved for me ) , then drove off in suit and sober dark overcoat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #25:1>
It was another cold , cloudy day with the promise of more snow , although that from yesterday hadn't settled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #26:1>
I was in luck -
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #27:1>
just as I arrived at the hospice , someone else left , so I could park at the front .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #28:1>
My instincts were to keep well away from the back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #29:1>
Then up the steps , through the double doors and into a wide , brightly-lit corridor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #30:1>
A receptionist sat behind a glass partition to the right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #31:1>
&lsquo; My name 's Jones , &rsquo; I told her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #32:1>
&lsquo; I have an appointment with Dr Westerleigh at ten . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #33:1>
&lsquo; Would you like to take a seat while I tell him you 're here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #34:1>
I sat and looked around .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #35:1>
The corridor , which was more of an entrance hall really , was decorated in bright cheerful colours , although when you looked closely , the paint was grubby and cracked in places and the carpet worn .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #36:1>
The bust of a moustachioed worthy stood on a plinth nearby with a table and vase of flowers beside it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #37:1>
I 'd already given some thought to my approach and went over it again in my head now - although much would depend on circumstances .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #38:1>
I had to find out where the controlled drugs were kept , and how they were ordered , delivered and paid for .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #39:1>
This meant getting involved in administration - not what you 'd expect from a charity official .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #40:1>
Well , I 'd have to be a nosy and interfering charity official .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #41:1>
&lsquo; Dr Westerleigh will see you now , Mr Jones . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #42:1>
I stood up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #43:1>
&lsquo; Oh , thanks ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #44:1>
&lsquo; He 's on the second floor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #45:1>
Take the lift , down the corridor facing you , then his room 's on the right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #46:1>
Can you find your own way ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #47:1>
I 'm rather busy at the moment . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #48:1>
A telephone beside her rang to make the point .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #49:1>
The lift , which was at a crossroads a little further down the corridor on the left , was the old-fashioned kind with a cage and bars you pull across , and was large enough to take a couple of stretchers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #50:1>
As it jerked upwards , I glanced at my watch .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #51:1>
A little after ten .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #52:1>
I found the corridor and walked almost to the window at the end before knocking at the door marked just R.C. Westerleigh .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #53:1>
There was no answer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #54:1>
I pushed it open and stepped into a small outer office , for a personal secretary perhaps , although it obviously wasn't in use .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #55:1>
Another tangible sign of a stretched budget .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #56:1>
Then the inner door was opened by a man of about fifty , an inch or two taller than me with a short , neatly trimmed beard and greying hair swept in wings over his ears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #57:1>
&lsquo; Mr Jones ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #58:1>
I 'm sorry , I was on the phone . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #59:1>
He held out a hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #60:1>
&lsquo; Richard Westerleigh . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #61:1>
His handshake was dry and firm and his smile reached his clear grey eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #62:1>
&lsquo; Do come in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #63:1>
Let me take your coat . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #64:1>
He hung it on a coat-stand near the window , then indicated a chair before taking his own seat behind his desk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #65:1>
&lsquo; Did you have a good trip ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #66:1>
&lsquo; Yes , I did , thank you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #67:1>
&lsquo; How did you travel ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #68:1>
by train ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #69:1>
&lsquo; No , I decided to drive . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #70:1>
&lsquo; Rather you than me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #71:1>
What was the traffic like ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #72:1>
&lsquo; It wasn't too bad , once I left the M25 . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #73:1>
&lsquo; Good , good , &rsquo; he said encouragingly , like a friendly GP .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #74:1>
He glanced down and I saw that the letter we 'd sent him was open on his desk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #75:1>
&lsquo; I was delighted to get your letter , of course , and very pleased to hear about the Council 's increased interest in the Hospice Movement .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #76:1>
Is this something recent , or have you felt this way for a while ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #77:1>
&lsquo; Comparatively recent .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #78:1>
We believe that the demand for hospice care is going to increase in the future and we want to know more about it to help us formulate our policy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #79:1>
That 's why I suggested a visit of two or three days . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #80:1>
&lsquo; I see . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #81:1>
He smiled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #82:1>
&lsquo; It sounds as though it 's in our interest for you to stay as long as you like .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #83:1>
Are there any particular areas you want to see ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #84:1>
&lsquo; Well , everything , really .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #85:1>
Patient care , obviously , but also , since our involvement would be financial , I 'd like to know how you 're funded and how your administration works . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #86:1>
&lsquo; I see , &rsquo; he said again
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #87:1>
He picked up a pencil , rocking it between a thumb and finger .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #88:1>
&lsquo; It might be an idea if you were to spend some time with each head of department here , let them show you their areas of work . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #89:1>
&lsquo; That be ideal . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #90:1>
&lsquo; We usually have coffee at about eleven , so I 'll introduce you to them then .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #91:1>
In the meantime , perhaps I could give you an outline of our approach here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #92:1>
&lsquo; By all means . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #93:1>
He leaned back in his seat , playing with the pencil as though it was a set of worry-beads .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #94:1>
&lsquo; You were right just now about the demand for hospice care increasing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #95:1>
We live in a society which can't with death any more , so it pretends it doesn't happen and has made any talk of it a social taboo . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #96:1>
He leaned forward .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #97:1>
&lsquo; Try to imagine the predicament of a man , or woman , who is dying , whose very instinct tells them that they are dying , and yet no one around them will admit it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #98:1>
They 're forced to keep up the dreadful pretence of immortality and their suffering is increased because of it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #99:1>
His words tied in so well with some of the things my brother Frank had said that I found myself listening more closely .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #100:1>
&lsquo; Here , &rsquo; he said , &lsquo; we have a policy of complete openness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #101:1>
Our patients know they haven't very long to live .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #102:1>
If they want to fight their illness , well , we might encourage them , depending on the circumstances , but what we don't encour<l>age is pretence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #103:1>
By being open about death , we hope to remove some of the fear of it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #104:1>
&lsquo; I 've never really understood that , &rsquo; I said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #105:1>
&lsquo; When it comes down to it , dying is dying , and I can't think of any way of making it attractive . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #106:1>
The pencil stopped moving for a moment .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #107:1>
&lsquo; Perhaps the most important thing we do , &rsquo; he said carefully , &lsquo; is to listen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #108:1>
When a person knows they haven't long to live , they 're bursting with things they want to say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #109:1>
We encourage them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #110:1>
We take the time to listen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #111:1>
That probably does more good than anything . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #112:1>
He 's right there , I thought , remembering how Frank had craved my company after his last relapse .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #113:1>
&lsquo; The next thing , &rsquo; he continued , the pencil on the move again , &lsquo; is to understand how much fear of death is really fear of pain , because that 's something we can banish with the appropriate drugs . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #114:1>
I said quickly , &lsquo; You believe in using drugs to suppress all pain ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #115:1>
&lsquo; Most certainly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #116:1>
We now have regimens of medication that will completely erase pain and yet leave the patient mentally alert .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #117:1>
That 's important .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #118:1>
They 're not vegetables ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #119:1>
they still have a degree of free will . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #120:1>
&lsquo; What drugs do you use ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #121:1>
&lsquo; Morphine and its derivatives are still the best . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #122:1>
&lsquo; Morphine 's a controlled drug , isn't it ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #123:1>
&lsquo; Yes , it is . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #124:1>
&lsquo; So I imagine you have pretty strict regulations concerning its use . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #125:1>
&lsquo; Naturally we do ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #126:1>
it 's the law . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #127:1>
It was said easily enough , but the pencil was dead still now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #128:1>
&lsquo; As you 'll see for yourself , our regulations here are completely in accordance with the law . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #129:1>
Good , I thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #130:1>
That gives me an opening to pry further down the line .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #131:1>
I said , &lsquo; Can I ask you a couple of straightforward questions ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #132:1>
&lsquo; Please do . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #133:1>
I opened my briefcase and took out a notepad .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #134:1>
&lsquo; How many patients do you have here ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #135:1>
&lsquo; About thirty in-patients at any one time and perhaps three times that number of outpatients . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #136:1>
&lsquo; And how many staff ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #137:1>
&lsquo; Let me see ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #138:1>
three medical , ten nursing , five administrative and ... eight ancillary . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #139:1>
I jotted down some figures .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #140:1>
&lsquo; That 's quite a high staff to patient ratio . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #141:1>
&lsquo; It has to be , if we 're to do our job properly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #142:1>
As I said before , we have to do a lot of listening .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #143:1>
Our nurses are chosen as much for their ability to listen sympathetically as for their nursing qualifications . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #144:1>
&lsquo; How about your admin staff ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #145:1>
Five seems a lot for a unit of this size . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #146:1>
His eyes narrowed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #147:1>
&lsquo; Not really .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #148:1>
Our finances are extremely complicated and we need a large office to handle all our accounts . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #149:1>
&lsquo; I wonder if a computer could handle - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #150:1>
&lsquo; I think you 'll find the administrator more than happy to talk to you about his work , &rsquo; he said , firmly overriding me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #151:1>
&lsquo; Very well .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #152:1>
You said just now that your finances are complicated .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #153:1>
Would you mind telling me how you 're funded ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #154:1>
&lsquo; Not at all . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #155:1>
He leaned back and the pencil started moving again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #156:1>
&lsquo; St John 's is a charity in its own right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #157:1>
This building is owned by a trust fund and the Hospice is governed by a committee of trustees -
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #158:1>
in fact James Pilning , our administrator , is a trustee himself , and I 'm sure he 'd be pleased to explain how it works . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #159:1>
&lsquo; Isn't that a little irregular ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #160:1>
I mean , to an extent , it makes him his own employer , doesn't it ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #161:1>
&lsquo; You may have a point there , &rsquo; he agreed , not in the least put out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #162:1>
&lsquo; However , the situation was already in situ when I came here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #163:1>
&lsquo; I see . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #164:1>
I did , too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #165:1>
He was telling me that he didn't like it but couldn't do anything about it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #166:1>
&lsquo; I was telling you about our funding , &rsquo; he continued .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #167:1>
&lsquo; Apart from the general public and other charities , we were funded by Cale Area Health Authority until the reorganization three years ago when Areas were replaced by Districts .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #168:1>
Since then , we 've been funded , very reluctantly , by three District Health Authorities , which - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #169:1>
&lsquo; Three separate Authorities ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #170:1>
Do you handle them as three separate budgets ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #171:1>
&lsquo; Yes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #172:1>
They say that since we own the building , they won't increase the amounts of money with inflation , which means in effect , we 're worse off every year . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #173:1>
He leaned forward .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #174:1>
&lsquo; This building .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #175:1>
Not many people realize how many of these beautiful Georgian buildings were in fact jerry-built , eighteenth-century style .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #176:1>
We 're sitting in one now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #177:1>
Two years ago , we had to replace the roof at a cost of &pound-sign;90,000 .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #178:1>
I thought St John 's was going to close then , but a wealthy patient died and left us enough money to cover it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #179:1>
&lsquo; That was fortuitous . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #180:1>
&lsquo; For us , yes . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #181:1>
He sat back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #182:1>
&lsquo; Now , the building needs more repairs , only &pound-sign;40,000 this time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #183:1>
Only .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #184:1>
It might as well be forty million . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #185:1>
His eyes held me with their intensity .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #186:1>
&lsquo; Perhaps you can understand now why we were so glad to get your letter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #187:1>
It 's not just extra equipment , or more books for the patients ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #188:1>
it 's our survival . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #189:1>
&lsquo; Yes , I can see that , &rsquo; I said into the anti-climax that followed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #190:1>
I felt rather cheap .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #191:1>
He said , suddenly changing the subject .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #192:1>
&lsquo; Has anyone shown you your room yet ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #193:1>
&lsquo; No , I came straight up here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #194:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry , what must you think of my manners .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #195:1>
I 'll take you up now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #196:1>
Do you have a suitcase ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #197:1>
&lsquo; It 's in my car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #198:1>
I 'll go and get it , shall I ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #199:1>
&lsquo; D' you need a hand ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #200:1>
I shook my head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #201:1>
&lsquo; No , thanks . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #202:1>
&lsquo; I 'll wait here for you , then . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #203:1>
As the lift dropped , I was thinking : Yes , there 's a lot of tension there ... and he did react when I mentioned controlled drugs ... although that could be because of Bill 's visit ... and the tension might be because of money problems ... but how much easier it would be to hide any financial discrepancies among three separate budgets ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #204:1>
It wasn't until I was walking down the main corridor that I realized that I hadn't told him about Maurice and made a note to do it as soon as I got back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #205:1>
Outside , it had started snowing again , large drifting flakes that had already begun to settle in the park .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #206:1>
I hauled my case from the back seat of the car and lugged it up the steps to the corridor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #207:1>
Two nurses were about to push a patient in a wheelchair into the lift .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #208:1>
&lsquo; Room for me as well ? &rsquo; I called .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #209:1>
&lsquo; Oh , I should think so , &rsquo; said one of them , a jolly , red-faced girl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #210:1>
&lsquo; Except that we 're going down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #211:1>
I expect you want to go up . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-004 #212:1>
I nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #1:1>
( 14 )
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #2:1>
FOR several days Amy 's step was brisker than usual .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #3:1>
Her movements were more supple .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #4:1>
Her face , to those of her own sex who had an eye for such transformations , radiated a contentment not habitual to her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #5:1>
The matron and some of the sisters with whom she worked at the hospital remarked on a sparkle in her eye not consonant with the war news , which was grim , and the information that her husband was about to be seconded to the Near East .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #6:1>
Pritchard was quick to notice that the corners of her mouth turned upwards instead of down , and the tight , disapproving lines about the nostrils had given way to an unwonted joyousness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #7:1>
She remarked upon the inexplicable change to Mrs Staples whose only comment was to nod her head first from top to bottom and then from left to right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #8:1>
&ldquo; Butter wouldn't melt in 'er mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #9:1>
She 's that amiable that it wouldn't surprise me if she addressed a word to you next time she comes into the kitchen . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #10:1>
This prospect had the opposite effect upon Mrs Staples to that intended .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #11:1>
The cook was galvanised into action .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #12:1>
She dropped her crochet work on the floor , got up and walked to the lavatory where she locked herself in with a loud clack of the bolt and remained incarcerated for twenty minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #13:1>
Alas , Amy 's euphoria did not last longer than ten days at most .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #14:1>
It began to dwindle when it dawned upon her that she was very much in love .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #15:1>
That the appetite comes with eating may be an adage as old as the hills &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #16:1>
but the appetite only once aroused may be no less voracious .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #17:1>
Amy craved for a renewal of that rough treatment which she received from Ernst and was pleased to call love .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #18:1>
But how was it to be brought about ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #19:1>
She had not , as Ernst remarked caustically to Dodds that very afternoon , once bothered to meet the German prisoner who for months past had been working , voluntarily , in her kitchen garden , or even convey to him a word of gratitude , so great had been her dislike of having to speak to the man unknown .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #20:1>
Now that the man was known , at least in the biblical sense , it would be awkward for her to make his acquaintance on the footing of mistress inspecting his handiwork in her garden under the proprietary supervision of old Dodds .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #21:1>
Dodds would certainly not leave her side for an instant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #22:1>
And even if he were to do so , she could hardly propose to Ernst a further rendezvous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #23:1>
How and where could one take place ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #24:1>
Her lot struck Amy as bitter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #25:1>
She was prevented from meeting a man with whom she was infatuated , a man who spent every day of the week three hundred yards from her own house by the proprieties , by those absurd social conventions which dictated what was becoming a lady of her position , and furthermore by duty to King and country .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #26:1>
She shuddered as she remembered her prejudices which amounted to spurning with contumely and disgust the enemy at her door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #27:1>
Her duty to her husband , fighting on foreign field for his and her freedom , she did not consider at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #28:1>
These thoughts were spinning round her head as she sat at supper when Pritchard walked into the dining-room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #29:1>
Prim and correct in her starch and streamers Pritchard laid on Amy 's table-mat a plate of semolina pudding over which a skin of a peculiarly repellent texture suggesting that the substance had been boiled not in milk , but chalk , was visibly forming .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #30:1>
&ldquo; I don't think l can face this concoction , &rdquo; Amy said as the corners of her mouth turned down and her nostrils gave a snort as in olden days .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #31:1>
Pritchard was quick to notice that more than the sight of Mrs Staples 's latest war-time recipe was disconcerting her mistress , although she had no clue to the cause .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #32:1>
&ldquo; To think of the Belgian refugees what would welcome a dish like this , &rdquo; she said with a studied tactlessness calculated to induce a revelation of the new turn of affairs which was influencing Amy 's manner .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #33:1>
Pritchard had over the years learned the fine art of scaling the heights of impertinence without quite over-stepping them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #34:1>
&ldquo; Damn the Belgian refugees !
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #35:1>
They can have it , &rdquo; Amy exclaimed with unusual warmth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #36:1>
Pritchard never remembered the mistress using such a wicked word before , not in all her days .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #37:1>
&ldquo; Yes , damn the refugees , and damn Mrs Staples too ! &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #38:1>
Amy cast down her napkin upon the table-cloth with that magnificent gesture with which the adoring saints must have cast their golden crowns around the glassy sea , and got up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #39:1>
&ldquo; Oh , Pritchard , &rdquo; she then said in a voice changed from the terrible to the pitiable , &ldquo; do you think this ghastly war will last for ever ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #40:1>
Will things ever be normal again &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #41:1>
and will food ever be edible again ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #42:1>
She forced a laugh .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #43:1>
The confidential interrogative encouraged Pritchard to air her views , which were invariably second-hand , having seldom come further than from the neighbouring internment camp .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #44:1>
&ldquo; Me brother Sam gives it another twelvemonth , m'm . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #45:1>
&ldquo; On what authority , pray ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #46:1>
&ldquo; He be very thick with the Commandant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #47:1>
Colonel Flagstaff did tell him that the exchange of prisoners pretended concern in Whitehall lest the Germans might be thinking on an invasion .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #48:1>
They is sending the criminal types of prisoner to more distant camps in the north , for safety reasons .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #49:1>
If they invades then they is sure to be dispelled . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #50:1>
&ldquo; Oh , are all the prisoners being exchanged then ? &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #51:1>
There was a note of anxiety in Amy 's voice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #52:1>
&ldquo; Not all , m'm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #53:1>
But you 've no doubt heard from Mr Dodds that that Ernest is one of them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #54:1>
Has left already .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #55:1>
Today was his last in the garden .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #56:1>
Mr Dodds says he is quite sorry , and even shook him by the hand when he said goodbye , which is going a bit far to my way of thinking , though he be a fine upstanding young fellow . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #57:1>
&ldquo; No , I had not heard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #58:1>
Nobody tells me anything , &rdquo; Amy said slowly as she sat down again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #59:1>
&ldquo; That will do , Pritchard . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #60:1>
&ldquo; Thank you , m'm . &rdquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #61:1>
( 15 )
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #62:1>
PRITCHARD had her own ideas why Ernst was among &ldquo; the criminal type &rdquo; of prisoners being exchanged at sudden notice , or rather sudden as far as the War Office was concerned , for that ponderous ministry moved slowly even at the height of war .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #63:1>
But she could get nothing out of Sam .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #64:1>
He merely pointed out , when she pumped him , that he was a very insignificant cog in the camp machinery , and that all policy was determined by the Commandant , whose name incidentally was Wagstaffe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #65:1>
Her brother 's manner of parrying her inquisitiveness merely confirmed her suspicion that he did know the reason for Ernst 's departure .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #66:1>
Indeed he did , but it was not the one she suspected .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #67:1>
The weather being fair and warm Pritchard decided one evening that instead of the usual knitting and crocheting routine in the dreary servants &rsquo; hall with no view from the windows , it would be a nice change to go for a stroll in the park .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #68:1>
When she broached the idea to Mrs Staples it was met with a severe negative , expressed not in words but nervous blinking of the eyes , implying that she for one would not accompany her for fear of being seen from the front windows of the house by the mistress .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #69:1>
Olive assured her that Mrs Fiennes-Templeton would like them to enjoy the air in the pleasure ground .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #70:1>
Since the cook would by no means of persuasion be induced to set foot outside the house Pritchard wandered off by herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #71:1>
It was midsummer and the evenings were as long as the shadows which elongated the shape of the house in a jagged jig-saw across the grass terraces and made the stumpy chimney-stacks into sharp arrows of doom .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #72:1>
The enormous tulip tree , a glowing blaze in the dying sun viewed from the corner of the house which she skirted on emerging from the back yard , arrested Pritchard 's attention .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #73:1>
The long , thin flange of darkness which it cast across the lake like some gigantic net , enhanced the tree 's bulk and girth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #74:1>
Which of the Templetons had planted it , and when , Pritchard could not remember .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #75:1>
She remembered the Squire telling her - unlike the mistress he liked to impart anecdotes when she was at her busiest - that it was the largest of its kind in the midlands .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #76:1>
Certainly it was so prominent a punctuation in the landscape that one was positively drawn towards it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #77:1>
It seemed to beckon one to come and pay homage to its hoary virility and power to augment its majesty as each year passed by .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #78:1>
Pritchard was no poet but she was accustomed to respect all wonders of nature as well as artifice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #79:1>
As she descended the third and fourth terraces she recalled that it was just about there that she had come across Rupert on the last evening of the Easter holidays .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #80:1>
His face was careworn and creased with anguish .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #81:1>
He was almost breathless from having run towards her uphill from , it could only be , the lake .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #82:1>
Where exactly had he been ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #83:1>
The walk round the lake was nowadays obstructed by overgrown brambles and laurels .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #84:1>
He could not have walked the whole way round it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #85:1>
Besides the path led nowhere else , it being raised between the lake and a wide fosse , always full of stagnant water , which separated the park from the home farm , now under plough .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #86:1>
On reaching the tulip tree Pritchard was immediately confronted by the temple .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #87:1>
She had always disliked this building .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #88:1>
To her it was cold , unsanctified , sinister .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #89:1>
She had seldom entered it all the years she had been in service at Templeton .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #90:1>
She was not adventuresome .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #91:1>
It now occurred to her that Rupert must have been there when he heard her calling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #92:1>
This evening her curiosity urged her to go inside and look around .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #93:1>
Her domestic training impelled her to mutter timid exclamations of disapproval that the room was so dirty and untidy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #94:1>
It called aloud for someone with a broom and duster .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #95:1>
There were flakes of plaster fallen from the ceiling on to the floor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #96:1>
They had lately been trodden on , as though by the feet of persons scuffling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #97:1>
One of the benches had been sat upon for the mattress was all over the place , and crumpled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #98:1>
Her eye lit upon the remains of a torch along the skirting .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #99:1>
She picked it up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #100:1>
An odd sort of torch she thought , and not one she had seen in any of the Stafford ironmongers ' shops .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #101:1>
On the nickel bottom which had broken from the cheap hinge she noticed the manufacturer 's name and address stamped .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #102:1>
Peering through her thick lenses Pritchard could only make out from the awkward lettering that it was not English .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #103:1>
&ldquo; Humph ! &rdquo; she said to herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #104:1>
There were foot-marks too in the alcove , in front of , and what was stranger still , behind the horrid grey head of a leering gentleman - she could only suppose it was a gentleman - without a nose on a pedestal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #105:1>
There were marks of fingers upon the dusty head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #106:1>
She peered at the back of the head which had likewise been tampered with .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #107:1>
This was made evident to her by further finger-marks on the dust .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #108:1>
She peered and she peered until she saw a thin slither of paper protruding from behind the neck of the horrible gentleman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #109:1>
She pulled at it and extracted Ernst 's letter to Rupert .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #110:1>
This was thrilling , a reward for her meticulous detective work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #111:1>
Pritchard took the envelope to the door and sat on the top step under the portico .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #112:1>
It was still broad daylight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #113:1>
Adjusting her spectacles she began to tackle the pencilled writing on the back of the envelope .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #114:1>
The script was extremely difficult to decipher , being written in a long , sloping hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #115:1>
By dint of much heavy breathing , running of the index finger under the lines and laboured movement of the lips Pritchard succeeded in deciphering the gist of Ernst 's message .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #116:1>
&ldquo; Dear R &rdquo; -
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #117:1>
that must be Master Rupert .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #118:1>
And it was quite obvious who E was .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #119:1>
He could not accept the memento , he couldn't .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #120:1>
What would that be ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #121:1>
The missing gold pencil perhaps .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #122:1>
Wouldn't be a thief .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #123:1>
Oh , the bad boy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #124:1>
But the pledge in the shed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #125:1>
The Hun would always keep that , whatever he meant by it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #126:1>
Well , well !
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #127:1>
Pritchard issued a low exhalation of breath which was more a confirmation of suspicion than a note of surprise .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #128:1>
She held the sealed letter up to the waning light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #129:1>
No , she would not open it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-005 #130:1>
Nor would she mention her discovery to a soul , not even Mrs Staples .

CHAPTER 9
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #14:1>
Coram 's Mews turned out to be an alley .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #15:1>
The first sight of it produced a sinking feeling in Dee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #16:1>
It looked like the sort of place where muggers might lurk and accidents wait to happen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #17:1>
And she was seeing it at its best in the pale late afternoon sunlight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #18:1>
Instinctively she knew that when darkness fell , only one of the three ancient streetlamps would be working - if that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #19:1>
No. 5 was half way down the Mews .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #20:1>
A scattering of glass fragments beneath the streetlamp opposite it confirmed her worst suspicions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #21:1>
This was the deepest , darkest part of the Mews .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #22:1>
She shuddered to think of Connie walking down this cobbled alley late at night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #23:1>
It couldn't be safe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #24:1>
The flat was over a disused garage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #25:1>
The whole Mews appeared to be made up of a double row of garages , most of them abandoned , with broken windows and FOR SALE signs hanging dispiritedly over sagging wooden doors .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #26:1>
What was the college thinking of to let young women students leave the protection of their Hall of Residence for a dump like this ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #27:1>
If they were thinking at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #28:1>
Perhaps Professor Standfast had been in charge for longer than she had supposed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #29:1>
Worse , the narrow street door beside the overswinging garage door was ajar .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #30:1>
A flight of rickety stairs led up to No. 5A over the garage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #31:1>
Dee mounted them and was relieved to find that the inner door , at least , appeared to be closed and locked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #32:1>
Somewhat to her surprise , the doorbell was working and she could hear the sharp peal on the other side of the door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #33:1>
She waited , looking around the cramped passageway .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #34:1>
The paint was peeling everywhere &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #35:1>
it would be a surprise if it wasn't .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #36:1>
But what were those dark furry patches growing up from the floorboards ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #37:1>
There was a faint smell of damp and mould pervading the atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #38:1>
They were a long time answering the doorbell .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #39:1>
Perhaps nobody was home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #40:1>
Dee rang the doorbell again , hope rising .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #41:1>
This time she was aware of a slight rustle of sound on the other side of the door ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #42:1>
something hit against it with a soft thump .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #43:1>
Impatiently , Dee rang again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #44:1>
&lsquo; Who is it ? &rsquo; a voice called cautiously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #45:1>
&lsquo; Mrs Sawyer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #46:1>
I 'm Connie 's mother . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #47:1>
There was a gasp of consternation , a rattling of the lock and slowly the door swung open .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #48:1>
A tall , thin girl stood looking at her gravely , half-defensively .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #49:1>
&lsquo; How do you do , Mrs Sawyer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #50:1>
I 'm Tanya . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #51:1>
She extended her hand , at the same time executing a peculiar back-kick with one foot .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #52:1>
&lsquo; Do come in . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #53:1>
&lsquo; Thank you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #54:1>
The door opened directly into the living<l->room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #55:1>
As she entered , Dee saw that the peculiar footwork had not been some sort of suggestion of a curtsey , as she had thought , but an attempt to restrain an exuberant puppy who was frisking around Tanya 's feet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #56:1>
He attempted to dart forward to greet Dee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #57:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #58:1>
Tanya caught him by the collar and pulled him back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #59:1>
&lsquo; He 's very young .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #60:1>
I 'm still training him . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #61:1>
&lsquo; Isn't he quiet ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #62:1>
It was disconcerting to see such a bouncing , healthy puppy who was only making slight squeaking sounds instead of yelping or barking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #63:1>
&lsquo; He 's a Basenji ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #64:1>
they don't bark .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #65:1>
My parents said not to get a dog that might disturb the neighbours . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #66:1>
&lsquo; The neighbours ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #67:1>
Dee glanced towards the deserted Mews .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #68:1>
&lsquo; Not here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #69:1>
Tanya flushed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #70:1>
&lsquo; At home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #71:1>
We live in a block of flats .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #72:1>
He 's a very good guard dog , though , &rsquo; she added defensively .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #73:1>
&lsquo; You mean , he doesn't bark ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #74:1>
he just bites . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #75:1>
&lsquo; Well , yes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #76:1>
Or he will when I 'm through training him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #77:1>
Oh , but he wouldn't bite you - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #78:1>
She put her hand on Dee 's arm and said firmly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #79:1>
&lsquo; Friend , Barney ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #80:1>
friend . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #81:1>
The puppy agreed with a joyous gurgle , wagged his curly tail , and renewed his efforts to reach Dee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #82:1>
&lsquo; It 's all right . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #83:1>
Dee crouched and extended a hand to him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #84:1>
He sniffed at it eagerly and Tanya relaxed her hold on his collar .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #85:1>
&lsquo; How long have you had him ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #86:1>
Dee asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #87:1>
&lsquo; Connie hasn't mentioned him in any of her letters . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #88:1>
&lsquo; Just over a week .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #89:1>
Connie hasn't seen him yet . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #90:1>
Tanya flushed unhappily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #91:1>
&lsquo; I got him while she was gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #92:1>
I don't think she 'll mind . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #93:1>
&lsquo; Where is Connie ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #94:1>
Dee rose to her feet , abruptly ending the social part of the encounter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #95:1>
&lsquo; I -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #96:1>
I don't know .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #97:1>
I mean - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #98:1>
Tanya contradicted herself instantly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #99:1>
&lsquo; I mean , she 's on holiday .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #100:1>
We 're expecting her back any minute now . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #101:1>
She looked towards the door , as though Connie might materialize there at any second .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #102:1>
&lsquo; When did you last hear from her - any of you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #103:1>
&lsquo; We haven't heard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #104:1>
We didn't expect to .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #105:1>
I mean , it was holiday time for all of us .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #106:1>
There was no point in sending each other postcards when no one was going to be here to receive them . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #107:1>
Dee looked at her thoughtfully .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #108:1>
The girl was more upset than her words indicated .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #109:1>
Was it because she knew - or suspected - more than she was admitting ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #110:1>
&lsquo; Where are the others ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #111:1>
I 'd like to speak to them , too . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #112:1>
&lsquo; They 're not here just now . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #113:1>
&lsquo; I can see that . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #114:1>
More accurately , she could sense it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #115:1>
The two doors opening off the living-room were ajar and no sound came from behind them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #116:1>
There was no door separating the room from the tiny kitchen , and a narrow door at the back of the kitchen must lead either to the bathroom or to the rear exit - if any .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #117:1>
Dee did not get the feeling that any laws regarding fire safety were closely observed in these flats &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #118:1>
there might be no back escape route at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #119:1>
&lsquo; I 'm just here now because I have a rotten cold . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #120:1>
Tanya sniffed unconvincingly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #121:1>
&lsquo; I decided to cut classes today . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #122:1>
&lsquo; What time do you expect the others ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #123:1>
Did - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #124:1>
Dee groped for their names -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #125:1>
&lsquo; did Jaycee and Maggie go to classes today ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #126:1>
&lsquo; I -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #127:1>
I 'm not sure . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #128:1>
This line of questioning was making Tanya very unhappy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #129:1>
&lsquo; They might have . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #130:1>
&lsquo; And they might not . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #131:1>
Dee watched Tanya trying to think of a satisfactory response .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #132:1>
&lsquo; I don't know . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #133:1>
Tanya shrugged , admitting defeat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #134:1>
&lsquo; I haven't seen them ... lately . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #135:1>
&lsquo; What do you mean by &ldquo; lately &rdquo; ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #136:1>
Dee pounced on the word .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #137:1>
&lsquo; When did you see them last ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #138:1>
Before the Easter Break ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #139:1>
The girl 's expression told her she was hitting uncomfortably close to the truth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #140:1>
&lsquo; They haven't come back , either , have they ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #141:1>
&lsquo; They -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #142:1>
they said they might be back late .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #143:1>
They asked me to cover for them . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #144:1>
&lsquo; And Connie ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #145:1>
Did she plan to overstay her break ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #146:1>
Were you supposed to cover for her , too ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #147:1>
&lsquo; Oh , Mrs Sawyer - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #148:1>
Tanya was close to tears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #149:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #150:1>
I wish I could tell you she did , but she didn't .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #151:1>
I don't know what 's happened to -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #152:1>
I mean , I don't know where she is or why she isn't back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #153:1>
I 've been getting so worried . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #154:1>
&lsquo; That makes two of us . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #155:1>
Dee reflected grimly that it was too bad that the other half of the worried duo couldn't have been Hal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #156:1>
But it was too late to worry about that now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #157:1>
&lsquo; Are they together ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #158:1>
Dee snapped .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #159:1>
&lsquo; What ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #160:1>
Who ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #161:1>
&lsquo; Did Connie go off with Jaycee and Maggie ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #162:1>
&lsquo; Oh no ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #163:1>
Tanya seemed shocked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #164:1>
&lsquo; She wouldn't do that ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #165:1>
&lsquo; Why not ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #166:1>
There was something funny here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #167:1>
&lsquo; Well , um , she just wouldn't .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #168:1>
She 's more tactful than that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #169:1>
They -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #170:1>
they had reservations made for just the two of them . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #171:1>
&lsquo; The two of them , &lsquo; Dee echoed thoughtfully .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #172:1>
&lsquo; Oh ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #173:1>
Tanya appeared quite relieved as the telephone rang .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #174:1>
&lsquo; Excuse me , I 'll have to answer the phone . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #175:1>
She was nervous as she crossed the room under Dee 's watching gaze .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #176:1>
&lsquo; Sit down , &rsquo; she said uneasily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #177:1>
&lsquo; Please .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #178:1>
I won't be a minute . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #179:1>
Unhappily for Tanya , the telephone was in a corner of the living-room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #180:1>
She picked it up and compromised with privacy by half-turning her back on Dee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #181:1>
&lsquo; Hello ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #182:1>
The response made her even unhappier .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #183:1>
&lsquo; Oh , hello , Dr Carson .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #184:1>
Yes , this is Tanya .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #185:1>
No , I 'm sorry , er , Jaycee isn't here right now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #186:1>
No , I don't know when he 'll be back ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #187:1>
He ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #188:1>
Jaycee was a male ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #189:1>
Dee stopped listening .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #190:1>
Connie hadn't told them that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #191:1>
Not surprisingly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #192:1>
She 'd have known her father would have thrown a fit - and her mother wouldn't be very pleased , either .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #193:1>
Connie hadn't been guilty of an outright lie , but it was a definite deception .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #194:1>
By referring to Jaycee by name , Dee realized now , and never by gender , Connie had allowed her parents to assume that Jaycee was another girl &semi; that four females were sharing the flat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #195:1>
She had intended them to assume that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #196:1>
What else hadn't Connie told them ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #197:1>
What other little deceptions was she involved in ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #198:1>
Tanya was still placating Dr Carson , reluctant to end one awkward conversation and go back to another .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #199:1>
Even after replacing the receiver , she hesitated to turn around .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #200:1>
The soundless puppy skittered around her feet , inviting her with chuckles and wheezes to stop what she was doing and play with him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #201:1>
The click of his claws on the bare floorboards made more noise than came from his throat . 
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #202:1>
Dee waited .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #203:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #204:1>
Tanya stooped to calm the puppy , keeping her face hidden .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #205:1>
&lsquo; That was Dr Carson - Jaycee 's tutor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #206:1>
He 's missed another tutorial .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #207:1>
I -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #208:1>
I 'm sure he never intended to miss so many .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #209:1>
I thought they were just going to be gone a few extra days .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #210:1>
I -
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #211:1>
I just don't know what to tell Dr Carson . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #212:1>
&lsquo; Isn't it about time you started telling everyone the truth ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #213:1>
&lsquo; I 've told you the truth . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #214:1>
Tanya looked up , startled .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #215:1>
&lsquo; Yes , I suppose you have .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #216:1>
I 'm sorry . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #217:1>
It was Connie who had been deceitful &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #218:1>
she shouldn't vent her anger on this innocent girl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #219:1>
&lsquo; What I mean is , isn't it time you reported this situation to the college authorities ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #220:1>
Tell them that your flatmates are missing - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #221:1>
&lsquo; They 're not missing ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #222:1>
Tanya cried .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #223:1>
&lsquo; They 'll be back . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #224:1>
&lsquo; They 're overdue now , &rsquo; Dee pointed out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #225:1>
She marvelled to herself at the traumatic effect the word &lsquo; missing &rsquo; had on English people .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #226:1>
Tanya was every bit as horrified by it as Professor Standfast had been &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #227:1>
like him , she was denying the implications it carried .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #228:1>
Dee had felt like that herself initially &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #229:1>
she had had time to get used to the word , to steel herself to the implications .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #230:1>
&lsquo; You were expecting them all back before this ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #231:1>
weren't you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #232:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; Tanya admitted , on the verge of tears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #233:1>
The puppy pricked up his ears and whined softly in sympathy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #234:1>
&lsquo; I went home for the holiday , so I wasn't here when they left .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #235:1>
I knew I was supposed to cover for them for a few days , then for a few more days I thought something might have delayed them - a ferry strike or airport problems or something .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #236:1>
I 've been expecting them every day . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #237:1>
&lsquo; You said they weren't together . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #238:1>
&lsquo; Jaycee and Maggie were .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #239:1>
They 're living together .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #240:1>
That 's why they moved out of the Residences , so that they could .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #241:1>
They found this flat , but they couldn't swing it alone , so Connie and I joined them to help with the rent and share expenses . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #242:1>
&lsquo; I see . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #243:1>
Another part of the deception .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #244:1>
&lsquo; I keep hoping they 'll come back soon , &rsquo; Tanya said despairingly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #245:1>
&lsquo; Every day I think : surely they 'll be here when I get back from classes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #246:1>
But they 're not . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #247:1>
&lsquo; Meanwhile , you 're here all alone . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #248:1>
&lsquo; I have Barney . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #249:1>
The pup looked up and wriggled happily at the sound of his name .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #250:1>
&lsquo; He 's really quite a good watchdog already . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #251:1>
Dee looked at her : a frightened but fiercely proud girl , alone in this ramshackle building , guarded by a puppy who couldn't bark and still had his milk teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #252:1>
Dee sighed deeply .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #253:1>
&lsquo; Sit down , Tanya , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #254:1>
&lsquo; We 've got to talk this through . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #255:1>
CHAPTER 10
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #256:1>
She was proud of herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #257:1>
Her first day 's pay , here in her hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #258:1>
The first money she had ever earned - that she knew of .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #259:1>
And it had been quite easy , after all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #260:1>
Not strictly legal , perhaps , but easy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #261:1>
From somewhere deep inside herself she had plucked the knowledge that casual catering staff were always needed - no questions asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #262:1>
Cash would be paid in hand at the end of each day and work was on a day-to-day basis , especially during busy seasons .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #263:1>
It promised to be endlessly fascinating , discovering all these buried nuggets of arcane information she possessed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #264:1>
Like rummaging through an attic on a rainy afternoon , unearthing all sorts of unregarded treasure .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #265:1>
&lsquo; We 're going to do all right , Co - Cora , &rsquo; she murmured to herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #266:1>
It pleased her to know that she could live frugally for a couple of days on her earnings , especially as a good meal had been part of the arrangement .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #267:1>
Maybe she would risk going back to the restaurant and working there again tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X268:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X269:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X270:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X271:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X279:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X280:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X281:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-006 #X282:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #1:1>
Josh inclined his head absent-mindedly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #2:1>
He was thinking of the inspector 's words and looking towards the tall , Sharptor mine engine-house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #3:1>
A great cast-iron beam protruded through an opening high up in the building .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #4:1>
Inside was the engine - his engine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #5:1>
He had built it after serving a three-year apprenticeship at the Harvey 's foundry at Hayle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #6:1>
He had supervised its installation at the mine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #7:1>
The finest engine in the county , it had been built to last a lifetime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #8:1>
Incorporated in the great wooden beams which descended deep into the mine-shaft was a revolutionary &lsquo; man-engine &rsquo; , the first of its kind in the county .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #9:1>
Nearby was the pumping-engine he had also built and installed ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #10:1>
Josh 's gaze shifted to the police inspector and then on to Leander Strike .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #11:1>
&lsquo; Mining is a peculiar business , Inspector .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #12:1>
You need to be a gambler to invest in a mine - and only the boldest gamblers succeed . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #13:1>
Josh and his father leaned side by side on the gate beside the stable at the rear of the house , saying little .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #14:1>
There was no need for talk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #15:1>
Blue smoke rose lazily from the pipes clenched between the teeth of both men and each was content in the companionship of the other .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #16:1>
The emotional reunions were over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #17:1>
Almost twenty years of separation had been bridged .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #18:1>
From where the men stood , high Bodmin Moor fell away to the Marke valley .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #19:1>
Beyond the valley the land unfolded in a breathtakingly spectacular fashion to the wide plains extending on either side of the Tamar river .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #20:1>
On the far horizon the western heights of Dartmoor rose , an irregular mass , from the plain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #21:1>
A brief , early-summer storm seemed to be following the course of the river that separated Cornwall from the rest of England .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #22:1>
Behind the storm a soft-hued rainbow promised a crock of gold on either side of Kit Hill .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #23:1>
The mine-embellished landmark reared a thousand feet from the valley floor to form a giant stepping-stone between the two moors .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #24:1>
Behind the two men Miriam called from somewhere in the house and she was answered by Anne 's high-pitched , excited voice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #25:1>
&lsquo; It 's been a long time since we last shared a pouch of tobacco , &rsquo; Ben Retallick broke the silence between father and son .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #26:1>
&lsquo; Your ma 's had all her prayers answered by your return with Miriam and the two young maids for her to fuss over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #27:1>
If only young Daniel had come with you her happiness would be complete . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #28:1>
&lsquo; Miriam would agree with ma , but Daniel 's a young man with a life of his own - and a good trading business between Matabeleland and the coast .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #29:1>
He 's an important man in that part of the world .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #30:1>
He 'll be among the richest one day , I 've no doubt . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #31:1>
&lsquo; You 've done well too , boy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #32:1>
Your ma and me are proud of you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #33:1>
&lsquo; None of us need ever go hungry , &rsquo; Josh conceded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #34:1>
&lsquo; That 's more than most can say , hereabouts .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #35:1>
The mines seem to have fallen on hard times . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #36:1>
&lsquo; Mining 's always been an uncertain business - as much for the men who put up the money as for those who work below grass .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #37:1>
Matters have grown worse these past few years .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #38:1>
Every time the price of tin and copper drops more men are laid off .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #39:1>
Many are leaving Cornwall and going to wherever there 's work to be had .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #40:1>
Mexico , Australia , America , South Africa ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #41:1>
but you 'll know something of this for yourself . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #42:1>
Josh nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #43:1>
He had successfully mined copper in South West Africa where many other minerals were being discovered and worked by immigrant miners .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #44:1>
Ben Retallick knocked out his pipe against the heel of one of his heavy mining boots .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #45:1>
He was now sixty-one years old , but until the Sharptor mine closed down he had been one of the mine 's shift-captains , responsible for the smooth and efficient management of the mine during his tour of duty .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #46:1>
&lsquo; Was the Sharptor mine being worked the way it should have been , before it went out of business ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #47:1>
Ben Retallick shook his head vigorously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #48:1>
&lsquo; It 's been running down for years .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #49:1>
Theophilus Strike was reluctant to hand it over to anyone else .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #50:1>
I think he knew what that nephew of his would do .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #51:1>
During his last years Theophilus was too old to visit us here and we couldn't get a sensible decision from him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #52:1>
We haven't had a decent engineer on the mine for years and the engines are costing twice as much to run as they should .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #53:1>
Tom Shovell held things together while he was mine captain , but he retired a couple of years back and Theophilus wouldn't appoint anyone to take his place .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #54:1>
Accidents were beginning to happen and the men were becoming edgy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #55:1>
You can't run a mine that way . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #56:1>
&lsquo; I met Tom 's son along the road today .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #57:1>
He seems a nice enough lad . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #58:1>
Josh told his father of the miners who had brought his coach to a halt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #59:1>
Ben Retallick nodded seriously as he refilled his pipe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #60:1>
&lsquo; Jethro 's a good lad but he 's keeping bad company .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #61:1>
Marcus Hooper 's been struck off the books of every mine hereabouts .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #62:1>
We 've no place for all this &ldquo; trade union &rdquo; nonsense in the mines of Cornwall .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #63:1>
It serves no useful purpose and gives the owners another excuse for laying off men .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #64:1>
They have reasons enough , without being handed more . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #65:1>
Josh did not challenge his father 's peremptory dismissal of the aims and usefulness of the trade unions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #66:1>
It was a subject on which they had never been able to agree .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #67:1>
This , at least , had not changed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #68:1>
&lsquo; Is there still enough ore underground in the Sharptor mine to make running it worthwhile ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #69:1>
&lsquo; Properly run it could be the best little mine in the area .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #70:1>
It 'll never be as grand as the Phoenix once was - or make as much money as the Caradon - yet it could bring in a tidy profit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #71:1>
But it needs to have money spent on it - and Leander Strike 's not a man to spend money on such a venture .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #72:1>
What with his gambling debts and a son away at some expensive school near London , he 's hard-pressed for money to live on . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #73:1>
&lsquo; What 's he hoping to make from the sale of the engine and machinery ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #74:1>
Ben Retallick cast a speculative glance at his son before shrugging his shoulders .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #75:1>
&lsquo; There are more engines than pasties on sale in Cornwall right now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #76:1>
I 've heard Strike is seeking at least five hundred pounds .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #77:1>
I 'd say he has more hope than expectation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #78:1>
He 'll be lucky to get scrap value .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #79:1>
Either way , it 's the end for the Sharptor mine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #80:1>
It won't affect your ma or me too much .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #81:1>
I 've spent a lifetime burrowing in the ground like a mole .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #82:1>
It 's time I got to know the sun .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #83:1>
It 's the young miner I feel sorry for , especially one with a young family .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #84:1>
He 's a choice of taking his wife and children away from everything they 've ever known , or staying and watching them starve . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #85:1>
Ben Retallick sucked his pipe noisily into life and peered at his son through the blue smoke .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #86:1>
&lsquo; Are all these questions leading somewhere ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #87:1>
Josh nodded before straightening up away from the gate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #88:1>
&lsquo; It 's possible , but let 's go up to the house and see whether Ma and Miriam have managed to get the girls to bed yet . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #89:1>
He shivered suddenly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #90:1>
&lsquo; It may be early summer for everyone else , but twenty years in Africa 's thinned my blood . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #91:1>
Miriam 's sister , Patience , came to the house at Sharptor early the next morning .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #92:1>
Seeing the two women standing together they were unmistakably sisters - but the similarities ended with the physical likeness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #93:1>
Patience was a washed-out drab woman of twenty-nine , already greyer-haired than Miriam although she was eleven years her junior .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #94:1>
Part of the reason for this was revealed when she admitted to having lost two children before giving birth to the three she brought with her on her visit to Sharptor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #95:1>
The surviving children were all under five years of age .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #96:1>
They played with the Gilmore girls in the garden , their clothes contrasting painfully .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #97:1>
Nell and Anne were wearing new , good quality dresses , while the clothes of Miriam 's nieces would not have been accepted for cleaning-rags by a fussy woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #98:1>
Patience was aware of the contrast in the children 's clothing and she said apologetically , &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #99:1>
It 's difficult keeping them decently clad with things being the way they are .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #100:1>
I can get bal-work on the mines sometimes - but Marcus couldn't get steady work , even when all the mines were working . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #101:1>
&lsquo; Would that be Marcus Hooper ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #102:1>
Josh put the question sharply and Patience looked at him quickly before shrugging her shoulders in a gesture of resig<l>nation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #103:1>
&lsquo; I see you 've heard of him already .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #104:1>
He says he 'd feel less of a man if he didn't speak up for what he believes in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #105:1>
I suppose he 's right , but it don't make things any easier for me and the kids when there 's no money coming in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #106:1>
I suppose I shouldn't complain , really .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #107:1>
He gets angry with Lottie and Jacob sometimes , but he wouldn't see 'em without a roof over their heads , even though they 're nothing to do with him . &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #108:1>
&lsquo; Our Jane 's children ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #109:1>
We met up with young Lottie yester<l>day , &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #110:1>
Miriam paused in the act of pouring boiling water on the tea leaves spooned into the cups on the table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #111:1>
&lsquo; When did Jane die ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #112:1>
&lsquo; Jane 's not dead !
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #113:1>
Oh no , not that one though she might as well be as far as Lottie and Jacob are concerned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #114:1>
She ran off with one of the soldiers sent here when they were expecting trouble in the mines .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #115:1>
I 'm talking about way back , when Lottie and her brother were hardly more than babes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #116:1>
There never was no trouble , except what Jane brought on herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #117:1>
She 'd let the fathers of Lottie and Jacob get away with what they did ... but she wasn't going to let this one out of her sight until he 'd done the right thing by her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #118:1>
I suppose two bastard children by someone else would hardly strengthen her claim on him , would it ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #119:1>
Especially that Lottie .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #120:1>
She 's growing up as wild as the moor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #121:1>
Sometimes I think she deliberately sets out to anger Marcus . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #122:1>
Jenny Shovell was in the house and she came from the kitchen with flour halfway up her arms , in time to hear Patience 's last words .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #123:1>
Snorting loudly , she said , &lsquo; It doesn't take a great deal to anger that man of yours .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #124:1>
I sometimes wonder why you stay with him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #125:1>
Mind you , young Lottie has enough cheek to try the patience of a saint . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #126:1>
&lsquo; I 've told her so myself , many times , but she doesn't heed me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #127:1>
The only one she 'll listen to is your Jethro .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #128:1>
If he so much as says &ldquo; Hello &rdquo; to her you 'd think she 'd been given a shilling . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #129:1>
The mention of a shilling reminded Miriam of her intro<l>duction to her ragged niece , but a tight-lipped Jenny Shovell was talking again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #130:1>
&lsquo; I 've told our Jethro to keep away from her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #131:1>
She 's trouble .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #132:1>
Unless something 's done about her she 'll end up like her mother . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #133:1>
Her face suddenly registered embarrassment .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #134:1>
Turning to Miriam , she said , &lsquo; Begging your pardon , Miriam .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #135:1>
I know Jane 's your sister , but there 's no denying she scandalised Henwood with her ways . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #136:1>
Trying to hide a smile , Miriam said , &lsquo; I seem to remember I did the same when I was Lottie 's age . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #137:1>
As Jenny Shovell 's embarrassment grew , Miriam allowed her smile to show .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #138:1>
&lsquo; I was very taken with what I saw of the girl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #139:1>
I 'll try to persuade her to come here to Sharptor to live .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #140:1>
She 'll be company for Nell and Anne .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #141:1>
Nell 's a very prim little thing ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #142:1>
they 'll be good for one another .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #143:1>
Tell her to come and see me , Patience . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #144:1>
&lsquo; I will , &rsquo; said Patience , gratefully , &lsquo; ... when I see her . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #145:1>
Patience suddenly realised from the expressions of the others that she would have to explain further .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #146:1>
&lsquo; It 's Marcus .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #147:1>
When he loses his temper with her she runs off , taking young Jacob with her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #148:1>
She did it again last night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #149:1>
I used to worry myself silly about her , thinking she wouldn't come back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #150:1>
But sooner or later there she is one mealtime , sitting at table as large as life , just as though nothing 's happened .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #151:1>
It 'll be the same this time , I don't doubt . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #152:1>
&lsquo; Where does she go ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #153:1>
&lsquo; Who knows ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #154:1>
Could be anywhere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #155:1>
Lottie knows this moor as well as folks say you once knew it , Miriam .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #156:1>
Although I doubt if she 'll do as well as you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #157:1>
This house is lovely ... and your clothes ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #158:1>
Our ma would be proud had she lived to see you now . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #159:1>
&lsquo; Yes , well ... you drink your tea and I 'll take you upstairs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #160:1>
I 've a couple of dresses I don't need any more .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #161:1>
They 'll serve you a treat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #162:1>
There are one or two things the girls have grown out of too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-007 #163:1>
They 'll fit your eldest , at least . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #1:1>
TWENTY-FOUR
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #2:1>
&lsquo; Mmmm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #3:1>
Lovely pinks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #4:1>
An admirer ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #5:1>
&lsquo; Aren't they just wonderful ? &rsquo; said Glenda , picking at the stems of her carnations , tossing them one by one into the tall glass vase on her desk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #6:1>
&lsquo; Let 's just say - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #7:1>
She paused , sighed winsomely , looking aged .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #8:1>
&lsquo; Let 's just say they 're from someone who cares . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #9:1>
&lsquo; Not Martin again ? &rsquo; Susan asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #10:1>
&lsquo; Who ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #11:1>
I know no Martin .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #12:1>
Oh , I think I know who you mean .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #13:1>
A squat , flashy type , given to adultery and abuse of his rather overblown corporate standing ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #14:1>
For<l>gotten now , love .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #15:1>
I know who really matters in my life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #16:1>
They 're from Ted actually .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #17:1>
We 've made a pact .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #18:1>
A new start .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #19:1>
No more philandering .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #20:1>
There was only ever meant to be him and me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #21:1>
I don't think I 've felt so happy since ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #22:1>
She looked into the space above her head that held her imagined past .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #23:1>
&lsquo; Not since the day we married .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #24:1>
You can love twice in your life , I 've discovered . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #25:1>
&lsquo; Do you mean love the same man twice ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #26:1>
&lsquo; Yes , yes , yes , &rsquo; she said impatiently , tossing the last flower like a spear and screwing up the cellophane wrapping .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #27:1>
Susan turned to her work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #28:1>
In the top drawer of her desk lay her letter of resignation from Jupiter Services ( UK ) plc .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #29:1>
She had offered 4 March , four weeks on Friday , as a suitable date .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #30:1>
She would post it on her way home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #31:1>
Now , she knew , she was trusting instinct alone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #32:1>
She had tolerated all the unhappiness she felt a soul should bear in a lifetime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #33:1>
She hated this place with its childish rituals and obedience to infantile rules .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #34:1>
And she no longer cared for London .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #35:1>
Once it had charmed and drawn her - now she saw its vapidity , the detached and paranoid lives of those who lived here , the noise , the concrete , the metal , the loathing on every street corner .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #36:1>
I have decided well , she thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #37:1>
As for Michael , she would see .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #38:1>
When you felt this strong everything sorted itself out , sooner or later .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #39:1>
TWENTY-FIVE
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #40:1>
Michael would still await Susan 's arrival at the station , though he no longer bothered to conceal himself , stand<l>ing at the entrance till she appeared with her shallow smile of greeting .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #41:1>
She had voiced no exception to his being there , but if she had he would have stopped this activity too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #42:1>
In the dead infertile weeks of the new year he became physically weak , sleeping for long periods , late into the afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #43:1>
Sometimes he would set off from home with a vague plan in his mind , for work , for finding Susan - just once , just this one time , he would say to himself - but the idea would have evaporated by the time he reached the end of the street .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #44:1>
He might wander by the shops , gazing at the window displays , or he might skulk in the amusement arcade near his studio , seduced by its warmth and spotlighted interior , the synthesis of appalling sound making no impression on him as he watched the pale winter faces of those who fed their robotic attention to Invadertron , BurgerBiter , Mars Repulser .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #45:1>
Now and again he would go to the studio and toy with his pencils and paints , thinking he might at least try to redecorate the place to sell the unused portion of his lease .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #46:1>
Once he put his largest brush to the wall , but within minutes his concentration had failed him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #47:1>
The marks he made there were odd , unre<l>lated , something else .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #48:1>
Something else ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #49:1>
Otherwise he might hang around in the park , hud<l>dled in his heavy coat , watching people passing with no curiosity or imagination for what they might be doing , what lives they might lead , their loves and hates , their problems .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #50:1>
He felt aloof from the passing of time , slightly intoxicated by his old sensation of waiting for something to happen , some calamity or great illumina<l>tion .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #51:1>
He felt removed from the common run of things , from other people 's lives , Susan 's life , this latter now seeming more untouched by his attentions than ever before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #52:1>
One day the question that had dominated him through all this time slipped from him , almost as if it had no meaning for him :
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #53:1>
&lsquo; Was the child mine ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #54:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; Susan said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #55:1>
&lsquo; Though I know I could never convince you of that . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #56:1>
Quietly doomed , he felt he must continue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #57:1>
&lsquo; Do you have a lover ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #58:1>
I wish to know , Susan . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #59:1>
&lsquo; Michael , I have never taken a lover .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #60:1>
There is only you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #61:1>
There has only ever been you since the day we met . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #62:1>
&lsquo; How can I know that to be true ? &rsquo; he whispered , eyes downcast , his wife 's reassuring hand on his shoulder .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #63:1>
&lsquo; You must believe me . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #64:1>
&lsquo; But I can't . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #65:1>
She is lying .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #66:1>
If only she would admit it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #67:1>
Then I might have justification for all this , proof of my own sanity ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #68:1>
Susan sighed with a killing delicacy , saying , &lsquo; I cannot satisfy you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #69:1>
If you want your suspicions , have them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #70:1>
They are no business of mine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #71:1>
You seem to be seeking to destroy yourself in some way , but you must not include me in your plan of action .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #72:1>
Michael , I cannot be made a scapegoat for your obsessions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #73:1>
I have nothing to deny .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #74:1>
I have never been unfaithful to you -
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #75:1>
it 's all in your imagination .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #76:1>
In fact , I rather think you wish it were true . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #77:1>
&lsquo; I don't understand . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #78:1>
&lsquo; If I say I haven't done anything , then you think I 'm being deceitful .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #79:1>
If I owned up to something I haven't done , then I would be guilty .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #80:1>
It doesn't add up , Michael .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #81:1>
Does it ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #82:1>
No .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #83:1>
If you put it that way ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #84:1>
On a grey , and morbidly warm mid-February day Michael Crumly leaned against an advertisement hoarding and watched sheepishly for the familiar face among the weary commuters .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #85:1>
Bodies passed in angry shoals .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #86:1>
He became conscious of the passing of time , never before having been denied his tiny reward of seeing Susan emerge from the gloom of the station .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #87:1>
The waves of travellers thinned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #88:1>
He looked down into the white-tiled portal where the ticket inspector yawned , scratching his head , briefly returning Michael 's glare from his booth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #89:1>
Michael shuffled up to the barrier and stared down the staircase to the empty square of platform .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #90:1>
Now he became more acutely aware of the time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #91:1>
She was nearly an hour late .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #92:1>
Had he missed her ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #93:1>
Might she have seen him first , looking shabby and wretched , and have decided that this was the moment when she no longer wanted to be associated with him ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #94:1>
He could hardly blame her , he thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #95:1>
He decided he must return to the house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #96:1>
He began running , feeling light and purposeful , scarcely seeming to touch the pavement with his feet , his heart strong and amazingly compliant with this sudden awakening .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #97:1>
Entering through the door he trod on the morning mail that still littered the hall .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #98:1>
The house was cold and quiet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #99:1>
&lsquo; Susan ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #100:1>
The silence was an affront , insulting , cruel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #101:1>
He quickly searched the bedrooms and the back yard , deciding , then , to run back to the station along the route Susan would have taken .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #102:1>
Once there , he pushed to the front of a small tutting queue at the enquiries window to ask about the trains .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #103:1>
&lsquo; Every sixteen minutes until seven-thirty , &rsquo; came the assistant 's spiritless reply .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #104:1>
He stood midstream against the dwindling tides of itinerants that issued from each train .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #105:1>
Susan was not among them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #106:1>
Three trains and thirty-five minutes later he returned to the house to ring her office , receiving only the bastard tones of an answering machine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #107:1>
He harangued himself bitterly for not having been more vigilant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #108:1>
The crowds of people flowing from the station seemed still alive in his mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #109:1>
Have you seen her ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #110:1>
Is she among you ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #111:1>
Why had he not asked those ques<l>tions ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #112:1>
Stupid , stupid man .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #113:1>
His anxiety became bound<l>less and he felt as if in the throes of a sudden bereavement .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #114:1>
He wanted to break up their home , the fragile and wholly superfluous objects of their shared life - mirrors , tables , the chiming clock , her idiotic , hated thimbles - suddenly taking on a sinister appeal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #115:1>
Frantic now , not thinking how he might control his rage , he ran from room to room , scattering sundry possessions from the dressing-table , bathroom shelves , kitchen cupboards , rushing out to the yard , back to the front door to halt and stare wild-eyed up the shadowy street where the ubiquitous children played , their ghostly forms static in the gloom while they returned his demonic glares .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #116:1>
He returned inside and slumped amongst the slight disarray , his head deep in his hands .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #117:1>
Susan came home just before midnight , having about her the air of someone who has become intentionally drunk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #118:1>
Michael looked at her wobbling in the lounge doorway , his head throbbing with the dry mechanical sounds of his long agitation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #119:1>
She threw her arms around him saying that she wanted to take him to their bed to make love .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #120:1>
Now , now , she was saying , if we do it now without thinking everything might be all right again , just as it was before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #121:1>
He hated her completely at that moment .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #122:1>
He burst from her arms , sending her twisting in a heap on the floor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #123:1>
&lsquo; Have you any idea of the pain you cause me ? &rsquo; he growled , his voice wavering as he kneeled over her crouched body , his mouth close to her pretty ear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #124:1>
But his words were not registering with her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #125:1>
She pulled herself up , seemingly ignorant of his presence , and dropped into the armchair , rubbing her eyes and tem<l>ples , seeming to drift between composure and uncon<l>sciousness , her skin uniformly pale .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #126:1>
&lsquo; At least tell me where you 've been ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #127:1>
Michael insisted , his voice firmer and yet circumscribed with a threatening hysteria .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #128:1>
&lsquo; I 've been out with my friend , &rsquo; Susan mumbled , head back , eyes closed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #129:1>
&lsquo; Am I not allowed friends any more ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #130:1>
Is this a new rule ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #131:1>
&lsquo; Susan ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #132:1>
She stood then , each slow movement to an upright position made with a painstakingly deliberate effort .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #133:1>
&lsquo; Excuse me , I feel a little unwell . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #134:1>
She staggered up the stairs losing her shoes on the way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #135:1>
Michael followed , demanding information , lust<l>ing for facts about where she had been , her motives for visiting this savage act of betrayal on him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #136:1>
He longed to hear her voice , anything she might say , but in the bathroom she dropped to her knees and was immedi<l>ately sick in the lavatory bowl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #137:1>
Michael despised her for her indisposition , roughly picking her up by the arm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #138:1>
&lsquo; Let go of me , Michael , &rsquo; she said wrenching herself free of his grip .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #139:1>
She leaned over the washbasin to rinse her face and hands .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #140:1>
&lsquo; Tell me why you did this to me , Susan , &rsquo; he screeched .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #141:1>
&lsquo; Why ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #142:1>
Can you tell me ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #143:1>
&lsquo; Be quiet , &rsquo; Susan said placidly , evenly , wiping her lips with the back of her hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #144:1>
&lsquo; The neighbours will hear you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #145:1>
Or do you want people to know how you behave towards me ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #146:1>
&lsquo; Susan ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #147:1>
&lsquo; Oh , stop it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #148:1>
You 're sick Michael .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #149:1>
Can't you see that ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #150:1>
Are yours the actions of a rational man ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #151:1>
There 's some<l>thing drastically wrong with you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #152:1>
She held a towel to her face and saw her reflection in the mirror , the mascara that she had borrowed from Glenda smeared and giving her a comically satanic look .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #153:1>
She was past caring about what she might say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #154:1>
&lsquo; I 've tried to accom<l>modate your excesses , God knows why .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #155:1>
I thought maybe you 'd come round .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #156:1>
We both know we cannot go on like this .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #157:1>
Did you ever stop to think how I might have felt when I saw you gawping at me from that stupid balcony ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #158:1>
&lsquo; I don't know what you 're talking about . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #159:1>
&lsquo; You were there , Michael ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #160:1>
I know it was you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #161:1>
Every<l>one in the office must have known you were there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #162:1>
What do you think it does to me when I have to make excuses to the girls saying I can't go out with them after work because you are waiting for me , ready with your tantrums and your madness if I 'm one minute late ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #163:1>
And I know you go through my things .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #164:1>
You need help .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #165:1>
And I don't think I 'm the one who can offer it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #166:1>
He trailed her from the bathroom as she stepped hesitantly across the small landing to the bedroom .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #167:1>
When she collapsed face down on the bed he began shaking her hard , trying to communicate with the strength in his arms , his feelings so confused at this point that he was unsure whether or not he might indeed want to make love to her , perhaps for the pain and distress it might cause her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #168:1>
But he did not .
<ICE-GB:W2F-008 #169:1>
Instead he went back downstairs , enveloped in his humiliation , and he paced the floor hugging himself , rocking , cra<l>dling his misery throughout the long night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #1:1>
ALICE WAITED AROUND all afternoon for Granville to call her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #2:1>
At the last minute , just before his office closed for the day , she could contain her worries no more and telephoned him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #3:1>
The receptionist answered , to tell her that he had gone out without saying when he would be back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #4:1>
Alice left a message for him to call her urgently , but she knew she wouldn't hear from him until the next day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #5:1>
The news was not going to be good .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #6:1>
It was a cool but pleasant evening , with an hour or so remaining before darkness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #7:1>
The sky was clear after the rainfall .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #8:1>
Alice put on her coat , still damp from her trip to the shop in the morning , and went for a walk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #9:1>
Her cottage was one of three small terraces that had originally been labourers ' cottages for one of the local farms .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #10:1>
Now only two were occupied : hers , and the one belonging to Mr and Mrs Watson next door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #11:1>
Alice had loved the house when she first saw it , seeing it as a consolation prize for the mess she had made of her life , a symbol of starting again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #12:1>
It had been neglected for years .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #13:1>
The previous owner lived in another part of the country and had rented it to soldiers living out of the Army camps on Salisbury Plain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #14:1>
The house had not been repaired or decorated for ten or more years , and the surveyor 's report had been intimidating and depressing , with its litany of rising damp , antiquated wiring , rotten timbers and leaking roof .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #15:1>
For some weeks it had been difficult to raise a loan , but she was desperate to move and more or less by sheer willpower had finally managed to get the money .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #16:1>
After the essential repair-work the place had become liveable , and as soon as she had settled down to writing her book she had grown to ignore the vague background smell of damp , the uneven walls , the unpredictable plumbing , and the house had simply become home , a symbol of neither past nor future .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #17:1>
It was about a quarter of a mile away from the main part of Milton Colebourne , if a village that consisted of a scattering of small houses , one general store and a pub could be said to have a main part .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #18:1>
The only access to the house was along the lane where Jimmy liked to sit , and this led into the wider lane that ran between the rest of the houses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #19:1>
Two cars passed her as she walked along , turning off into her lane and accelerating towards the house , reminding her nervously that the cat was out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #20:1>
She wished she did not love him so much .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #21:1>
She could see Eleanor Hamilton 's house as soon as she reached the main road to Ramsford .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #22:1>
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary from this distance :
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #23:1>
it was a tall , white-rendered house with a thatched roof , standing back from the main road in a large garden .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #24:1>
Until she met Eleanor , Alice had assumed the house was occupied by a family .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #25:1>
It looked too large for just one person , but Eleanor had easily filled the house by herself , finding a use for each of the rooms , content amongst her possessions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #26:1>
She was an enthusiastic gardener , a collector of old furniture ( &lsquo; Not antiques , &rsquo; Eleanor once said to her ) , a hoarder of books and records , photographs and silly mementoes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #27:1>
At the back of the house , overlooking the garden , was the large room Eleanor used as her study .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #28:1>
Her typewriter and desk were here , but Eleanor had said she no longer wanted to write , that her fingers were too stiff for typing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #29:1>
She was happy as she was .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #30:1>
Alice had sensed a kindred spirit in Eleanor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #31:1>
Initially it was because she was , or said she had been , a writer , but when they grew to know each other better this diminished in importance .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #32:1>
Eleanor had a quiet , self-absorbed life , retired and contented after the business of living .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #33:1>
Alice had admired this , thinking how she too wished to be contented now that a major and disruptive phase of her own life was behind her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #34:1>
They became friends easily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #35:1>
Alice had been glad to meet her and at first had tried to do several small favours for her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #36:1>
She had quickly learned that Eleanor 's frail physical appearance was deceptive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #37:1>
She needed no looking after :
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #38:1>
she was an active and intelligent woman with a good mind &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #39:1>
she was widely travelled , wise and alert to the events of the larger world .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #40:1>
She was stimulating company for Alice , reading the manuscript of her book and showing a constructive interest in it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #41:1>
She had lent her books from her own collection that had saved Alice several trips to libraries .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #42:1>
When the manuscript was impounded Eleanor had been a sudden ally .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #43:1>
It was to no avail , but it helped Alice through the first aftermath of the news .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #44:1>
Until then Alice had felt paranoid and helpless , wounded by the thought that someone in authority saw her as a threat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #45:1>
Eleanor at least had made her feel she had done nothing wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #46:1>
In spite of their closeness , Alice had never really learnt much about the other woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #47:1>
Eleanor did not like talking about herself , and usually avoided personal questions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #48:1>
Alice knew that she and her late husband Martin had been teachers , that she had written a number of novels when younger , that she moved to this house after his death , and so on , but very little more .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #49:1>
The novels in particular intrigued Alice , because she sensed that to read some of them might afford insights , but Eleanor so consistently downplayed them that she soon stopped asking about them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #50:1>
( A search through library catalogues - with an unmistakably furtive feeling - revealed nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #51:1>
None of the titles was even listed , and the only authors with the name Hamilton were other people . )
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #52:1>
Alice was now thinking about Eleanor in an awkward and disturbing combination of past and present tenses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #53:1>
Just as she had felt when her own parents died , it was impossible to believe that Eleanor was really dead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #54:1>
Yet she already accepted it , even to the point of realizing that she had been prepared for this kind of news .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #55:1>
Eleanor had seemed in good health , but she said her joints were stiffening with age and the cold weather was a torment .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #56:1>
She had always moved , and sometimes talked , like an old lady .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #57:1>
Alice reached the gated entrance to the house and glanced towards the door .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #58:1>
Mrs Lodge had said there were police cars at the house , but if that was true they had already left .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #59:1>
Alice hesitated , wondering if she should go to the house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #60:1>
It felt strange not to push the gate open and walk naturally to the door , as if it had become forbidden to her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #61:1>
But it was no longer the same .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #62:1>
For one thing Eleanor 's son might be there , and Alice was reluctant to interfere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #63:1>
While she was still standing undecided , the door to the house opened and a uniformed police officer appeared .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #64:1>
He closed the door behind him , then stood inside the porch with his hands clasped behind his back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #65:1>
He looked towards Alice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #66:1>
Feeling that something had been decided for her , Alice went through the gate and walked up the drive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #67:1>
She recognized the policeman :
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #68:1>
she often saw him when she was in Ramsford , the larger village two miles down the road , where he ran the one-man police station .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #69:1>
&lsquo; Can I help you , miss ? &rsquo; he said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #70:1>
&lsquo; I wanted to know .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #71:1>
Is it true about Mrs Hamilton ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #72:1>
&lsquo; Yes . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #73:1>
&lsquo; I was a friend of hers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #74:1>
I live along the lane over there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #75:1>
I was wondering - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #76:1>
&lsquo; Do you have information about Mrs Hamilton 's death ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #77:1>
&lsquo; No .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #78:1>
I only heard the news an hour or so ago .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #79:1>
It was a terrible shock . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #80:1>
The officer regarded her steadily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #81:1>
He was not reacting except as a cop on duty reacts ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #82:1>
no small-talk , no conversational offers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #83:1>
He was making her nervous , anxious to explain herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #84:1>
&lsquo; I think there might be something of mine inside the house . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #85:1>
&lsquo; And what would that be , miss ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #86:1>
Of course she instantly regretted having said anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #87:1>
Until that moment she hadn't thought consciously about the tapes ... but she knew they had been at the back of her mind ever since she heard the news .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #88:1>
They were innocent enough , preparation for her next book , but Eleanor had after all been murdered and the police were presumably searching for clues , and -
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #89:1>
The Home Office had made her feel that everything to do with her writing was in some way guilty or suspect .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #90:1>
&lsquo; I 'd lent her some books , &rsquo; she said , feeling implausible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #91:1>
&lsquo; They 're not important .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #92:1>
I can pick them up some other time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #93:1>
I was passing , and ... I 'm sorry , I shouldn't be here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #94:1>
I was very upset about the news . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #95:1>
&lsquo; I can't let you into the house , miss .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #96:1>
If you could tell us what the books are , I 'll see they 're returned to you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #97:1>
&lsquo; Just a couple of recipe books .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #98:1>
They don't matter . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #99:1>
She could feel the lie making her blush .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #100:1>
She hated herself for allowing the policeman to intimidate her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #101:1>
She started to move away .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #102:1>
The policeman said , &lsquo; I 'd like your full name and address , please . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #103:1>
&lsquo; It 's all right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #104:1>
I don't want the books back . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #105:1>
&lsquo; We 're conducting a murder investigation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #106:1>
We might want to ask you a few questions about Mrs Hamilton . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #107:1>
&lsquo; But there 's nothing useful I can tell you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #108:1>
&lsquo; A lot of people think that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #109:1>
It 's just routine . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #110:1>
He had his notebook out and was flicking the pages over , like a stage policeman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #111:1>
&lsquo; I 'd like you to meet the investigating officer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #112:1>
Would you call into the station , or would you prefer him to come to your house ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #113:1>
&lsquo; I 'm going to be in Ramsford tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #114:1>
I 'll call in . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #115:1>
The policeman wrote down her name and address , using block capitals .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #116:1>
He seemed as uncomfortable as she felt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #117:1>
He was young , but she had been used to that for several years , and not tall , which usually surprised her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #118:1>
He looked harmless enough : a country policeman standing outside a house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #119:1>
But these days that was a deception , a reassuring myth created by chief constables .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #120:1>
Modern policemen were moved around : inner city slum to affluent suburb , drug squad to regional crime prevention , riot control to country village .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #121:1>
Just as they were about to become corrupted or softened by a posting , orders moved them somewhere else .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #122:1>
There was an official rationale behind it , something to do with the broadening of experience , but it meant the concept of community policing had gone for ever .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #123:1>
She had learnt all this , ironically enough , from Eleanor herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #124:1>
Eleanor 's uncompromising and mistrustful attitude to the police was one of the first things about her that had intrigued Alice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #125:1>
She felt irritated with herself and self-conscious as she walked away down the drive , imagining the policeman was watching her , but when she glanced back from the gate he had turned away from her and was going into the house again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #126:1>
She wondered how he would get back to Ramsford without a car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #127:1>
Alice walked along the road in the direction of her house , thinking melodramatic thoughts .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #128:1>
If Eleanor had been killed by someone , perhaps she was now a suspect .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #129:1>
Her visit to the house had been noted , her name would be on the Hamilton file .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #130:1>
She imagined the constable telephoning his superiors at that moment :
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #131:1>
a woman from the village was at the house , said she knew the dead woman , something about property still in the house ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #132:1>
I called her in for questioning tomorrow , etc .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #133:1>
It was crazy to think like this !
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #134:1>
But she knew why :
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #135:1>
it was the damned Home Office seizing her book .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #136:1>
She had fretted about this for three weeks , endlessly thinking through the book in her mind , wondering what it was about it that had concerned the authorities .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #137:1>
The book seemed harmless enough to her : it comprised the biographies of six women , examining their lives and careers through traumatic events that had occurred in childhood .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #138:1>
There was nothing political , anti-establishment or radical about it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #139:1>
The women were not particularly famous , and none had been arrested for subversive activities , or been shot for spying , or had made pornographic movies , or anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #140:1>
Another possible explanation for the seizure was that it might have been thought of as a feminist tract .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #141:1>
Alice had heard about several feminist writers who had been harassed in recent years .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #142:1>
But her book was not overtly feminist , except by the implication of being about women 's lives .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #143:1>
Anyway , she took an independent line on feminism .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #144:1>
It seemed ridiculous that anyone could read something subversive into the book .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #145:1>
Maybe it was her choice of subjects ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #146:1>
But the women themselves were politically &lsquo; safe &rsquo; , by whatever standards of &lsquo; unsafeness &rsquo; the Home Office might looking for .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #147:1>
Two had in the nineteenth century , one had lived most of her life abroad , one had married a diplomat , and so on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #148:1>
Even so , a government official had confiscated the manuscript , quoted Section 17 of the Copyright ( Crown Property ) Act - a law of which she had never even heard until she received the terse , unsigned note - and the book was impounded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #149:1>
But now she was thinking about the tapes , somewhere in Eleanor 's house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #150:1>
They too seemed harmless enough to her , but what would police conducting a murder hunt think of them ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #151:1>
She tried to remember what might be on them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-009 #X152:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #1:1>
Catherine was there for the last days .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #2:1>
&lsquo; I hope your mother believed I wanted to do all that was best . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #3:1>
&lsquo; Yes , of course she did , &rsquo; Catherine said , stroking her aunt 's wrist where it lay on the coverlet and not fully understanding .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #4:1>
&lsquo; What was best at the time , I mean .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #5:1>
Maybe that 's two different things . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #6:1>
&lsquo; It 's all right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #7:1>
Really . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #8:1>
&lsquo; I hope she trusted me . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #9:1>
&lsquo; Trusted you ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #10:1>
Yes , of course she did . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #11:1>
She watched her aunt shake her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #12:1>
&lsquo; I didn't know that - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #13:1>
&lsquo; But why shouldn't she have trusted you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #14:1>
&lsquo; Maybe she thought - I 'd try to influence you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #15:1>
&lsquo; Influence me how ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #16:1>
&lsquo; It 's so long ago now . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #17:1>
Catherine continued to stroke her aunt 's thin , cooling wrist .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #18:1>
&lsquo; I could have done .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #19:1>
If I 'd set my mind to it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #20:1>
But I relied on Hector , for everything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #21:1>
If we 'd fallen out - where would that have left me ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #22:1>
That 's the point , you see . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #23:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; Catherine said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #24:1>
&lsquo; Your mother , she was just misunderstood .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #25:1>
Time and patience ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #26:1>
it wouldn't have taken any more than that - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #27:1>
Catherine didn't move , not wanting to disturb the flow and tempo of her aunt 's recollections .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #28:1>
&lsquo; Your mother was so smart , of course , so well turned out always .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #29:1>
Hector was so impressed by her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #30:1>
Everyone was .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #31:1>
She drew their eyes in a room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #32:1>
not by choosing to , I 'm sure .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #33:1>
It just happened , quite naturally enough .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #34:1>
It was very charming , and Hector thought so too at first ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #35:1>
I know he did . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #36:1>
Catherine measured a seemly silence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #37:1>
&lsquo; &ldquo; At first &rdquo; ? &rsquo; she repeated .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #38:1>
Her aunt shook her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #39:1>
&lsquo; Something seemed to close his mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #40:1>
I could never get to the bottom of it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #41:1>
&lsquo; &ldquo; Close his mind &rdquo; ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #42:1>
How ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #43:1>
Aunt Dodie sucked in her cheeks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #44:1>
&lsquo; He always &ldquo; knew his own mind &rdquo; , people said . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #45:1>
Her aunt lowered her voice still further .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #46:1>
&lsquo; He liked to think he did .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #47:1>
So , when he felt he might have been wrong , he didn't acknowledge it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #48:1>
With Hector , I really don't know if he was certain .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #49:1>
The pity was , he let a distance come between them , your mother and himself , and he stood on his pride . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #50:1>
Catherine bent over the wrists , straining to hear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #51:1>
&lsquo; You said , &ldquo; not certain &rdquo; ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #52:1>
&lsquo; There were always stories in Aquae-Regis .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #53:1>
Going round and round .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #54:1>
Gossip and rumours , tittle-tattle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #55:1>
It was just in the air .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #56:1>
But some of it sticks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #57:1>
Like burrs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #58:1>
You know ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #59:1>
Her aunt closed her eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #60:1>
&lsquo; It was so long ago .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #61:1>
But it 's as clear as ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #62:1>
Catherine placed her aunt 's left hand on top of the right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #63:1>
&lsquo; Another time , &rsquo; she said ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #64:1>
&lsquo; we can talk about it another time . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #65:1>
She was intensely curious , but also deeply uneasy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #66:1>
She felt she wanted to down a stiff drink .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #67:1>
&lsquo; I 'll leave you in peace now , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #68:1>
But before she had reached the door Aunt Dodie rallied .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #69:1>
She asked if she might see a hand-mirror , please , and when it was placed in her hand she started fussing , quite urgently , with her hair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #70:1>
Catherine smiled to see it , reassured by an action too innocent to be vanity , too familiar for her to believe that she wouldn't always have the spectacle to behold .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #71:1>
Her aunt was buried , at her own request , in the Cumberland town she had left twenty years before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #72:1>
In his brief address inside the church , the curate spoke of her being &lsquo; with the hosts of angels &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #73:1>
after her recent &lsquo; troubles &rsquo; , she was now &lsquo; crowned with glory &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #74:1>
The singing voices sounded feeble and half<l>hearted in that foxhole of cold , cheerless stone , with the window glass unstained and lozenge-leaded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #75:1>
Cars had to be used to reach the secondary , auxiliary churchyard , and in the course of the uphill journey a lorry transporting sheep found its way into the middle of the four-vehicle cort&egrave;ge .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #76:1>
At the graveside the curate adhered to the bald form of the funeral service , without any diversionary extolling of the deceased 's particular merits as a human being .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #77:1>
One of the bearers lost hold of his end of rope and with a couple of thuds and the macabre unsettling of the contents , the coffin lurched into its final resting-place .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #78:1>
Before leaving for Cumberland Catherine had organised afternoon tea in Cadell Street for a later date .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #79:1>
But she was so distressed by the curate 's conduct that on her return south she insisted the company present themselves at the Peregrine Hotel and damn the expense .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #80:1>
Chiefly what she was to remember of the afternoon in retrospect was her determination that Felix should have nothing more to do with Aquae-Regis .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #81:1>
She hadn't returned since his birth , and she found it harder and harder to breathe as the afternoon wore on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #82:1>
She wished poor Aunt Dodie - she of all people - could have been here , to enjoy a &lsquo; treat &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #83:1>
She had sent her what money she could , and between them they had managed , but there had been less and less to sweeten time 's passing in &AEligature;gypt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #84:1>
If her aunt was disappointed that she didn't come down to visit them , she hadn't reproached her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #85:1>
The many photographs and letters that regularly passed between them had had to substitute for a proper , meritorious relationship .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #86:1>
In the bathroom of the ground-floor bedroom which they were using as a cloakroom , Catherine wept bitter tears - and then she promptly made herself up using the cosmetics she 'd brought stashed in her handbag in anticipation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #87:1>
It was done with an unsure hand , but it was better than nothing , maybe better than she thought , because outside in the corridor a man 's head swivelled to watch her as his wife tugged on his arm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #88:1>
She rang Miss Cooper from the telephone at the front desk , resolved that henceforth Felix 's life should represent the etymological meaning of his name . &star;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #89:1>
The winter and most of spring were behind me , as were those two dried , withered sticks , my minders , in Aquae-Regis .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #90:1>
My mother had claimed me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #91:1>
I imagined on my arrival in Surrey that we were now to be living - briefly - among family &lsquo; friends &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #92:1>
The house felt as if it must be a holiday .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #93:1>
The french windows stood open ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #94:1>
figures drifted in and out of the rooms ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #95:1>
a lot of lemon barley water was poured from crystal jugs ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #96:1>
knockabout tennis was played beneath the trees ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #97:1>
an elderly spinster gardener sprayed the flowerbeds with a hosepipe and let me play beneath it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #98:1>
When we were ourselves , late at night and in the mornings , we were - apart from me - a nest of womenfolk , seven in all plus the maid .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #99:1>
Until lunchtime was over the only voices I heard were women 's , unless one of the wireless sets had been turned on and a male announcer was speaking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #100:1>
The house smelt of women : talcum , shampoo , eau-de-Cologne , drying nail varnish , the leather of new shoes , wet stockings hanging from the kitchen pulley .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #101:1>
Until we all sat down to eat lunch in the dining-room , they swished past me ( my mother too ) in dressing<l>gowns or kimonos , in various stages of make-up , chatting or singing the choruses of songs or breaking in new shoes on the floorboards between the rugs or blowing on their nails &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #102:1>
jewellery rattled lightly on their wrists , and just audible was the contact of one inner thigh on another .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #103:1>
I supposed they must be friends , because they were so at their ease , and always seemed to be involving themselves with my mother .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #104:1>
My mother let herself be taken over , and I didn't see so very much of her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #105:1>
Everyone was kind to me , and considerate , and gave me little jobs and responsibilities , and made sure that I was in bed by the same time every evening , after somebody - the roster varied - had prepared my supper and set it for me at the kitchen table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #106:1>
The customs were gentle , undemanding ones .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #107:1>
I would be taken along ( by whoever was available ) to the grocer 's or the baker 's or the fruiterer 's when the weekly supplies delivered in vans were running low on tea or Hovis loaves or mackintosh red apples , and en route we would pass Miss Spoak 's Jersey cow grazing in its triangle of meadow ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #108:1>
we would stop for a couple of minutes to play pooh-sticks over the wooden bridge that crossed the weedy rivulet we never learned the name of .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #109:1>
When there were letters to be sent I would be lifted up to the level of the slit in the post-box set in a high mossy wall , and I always became a train engine in Church Lane with the gas lamps and stations to stop at and set off steaming from .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #110:1>
My time there lasted from the rhododendron season at the end of May to the chrysanthemums fading on their stalks in October .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #111:1>
We had the advantage of a long , warm , blue summer and , afterwards , the bonus of a second little Indian one during our last days in that collapsible house intended for Indian climes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #112:1>
The french windows were only closed for rain , and never locked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #113:1>
My mother passed in and out with her friends and our life was as mannerly , urbane and piquant as any shown to a ripple of satisfied applause as the curtain rises on a stage . &star;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #114:1>
The summer was an exceptional one , and she didn't feign to Miss Cooper that she regarded the position as any more than temporary .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #115:1>
She herself acquired a summer disposition after the trauma of her recent manner of life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #116:1>
She breathed fresh Surrey air and even picked up from Miss Spoak who gardened for them a little skill in that practical art .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #117:1>
There were worse ways to bring up a child , and she wasn't ashamed on his behalf :
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #118:1>
he would remember of it ( she hoped ) what he chose to , and she 'd have a hand in its making .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #119:1>
The men who came - ironically their raison d'&ecircumflex;tre - were , as a general rule , well turned out , well bred and courteous and not at all bad examples to set before a young boy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #120:1>
Sometimes they gave him a threepenny bit or a silver sixpence , which she would have preferred they didn't &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #121:1>
but he showed no signs of being spoiled by indulgence , and politely mimicked surprise each time it happened .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #122:1>
Her hands were full with the house but not so full that she couldn't savour the summer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #123:1>
The girls all had their reasons for being here , stories to tell , which she respected whenever they wanted to tell her or not tell her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #124:1>
Miss Cooper had selected a congenial grouping - she clearly had a flair for it - and there were no major strains among them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #125:1>
No one seemed put out that she wasn't older and that she lived a celibate life herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #126:1>
There were temptations but she resisted them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #127:1>
She even enjoyed the self-discipline , the contradictions between the appearance of being one of the others and the actuality of her situation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #128:1>
The girls all knew that they could pack up and go any time , that they had money enough to cope , and realised too that Miss Cooper could probably have been persuaded to lend them some of the wherewithal to help set them up &lsquo; in business &rsquo; on their own .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #129:1>
It was an enlightened community , Catherine believed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #130:1>
Everyone was in receipt of what they required &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #131:1>
nobody was humiliated .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #132:1>
The novelty wasn't to wear off for her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #133:1>
She was aware as she was living these days that she was collecting pleasant memories and associations for herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #134:1>
She worked hard but she also drew strength from the peace of mind - a delicious kind of tiredness - at each day 's end , resulting from that same concentration on the manual and mechanical , from this respite in dealing with the buffetings of real life , from this amicable truce in the sexual war . &star;
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #135:1>
The men never appeared before two o'clock of an afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #136:1>
After lunch it would be my job to run to the top of the drive and undo the rope that held the five-bar gate to its post .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #137:1>
If I stood on the first or second bar I had no difficulty , and the gate would swing back of its own accord .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #138:1>
From a fork in a certain tree or from the upstairs balcony I would watch for the first car to turn in from the lane and send the thin gravel scattering .
<ICE-GB:W2F-010 #139:1>
It might be a familiar car or one that was new to me , but the welcome downstairs seldom varied in its tone .

<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #1:1>
The train has reached Reading , and I still have not decided whether to say anything to Selena concerning the late Mr Collins .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #2:1>
It is hardly probable that anything can be proved &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #3:1>
it is even possible that there is nothing to prove &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #4:1>
and unwarranted investigation might cause undeserved distress .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #5:1>
Murder , on the other hand , is a practice not to be encour<l>aged .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #6:1>
I could almost wish that I had not , finding myself with an hour or so to spare before a dinner engagement in central London , chosen to pass it in the Corkscrew .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #7:1>
Had I spent it in some other hostelry , I should now be returning to Oxford with a mind untroubled by any more disquieting burden than my responsibilities as Tutor in Legal History at St George 's College .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #8:1>
It is idle , however , to regret my decision .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #9:1>
It was to the Corkscrew that I directed my steps , and indeed in the hope that I might find there one or two of my young friends in Lincoln 's Inn .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #10:1>
I am well enough known there , it seems , for the barman to remember who I am and in whose company I am most often to be found .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #11:1>
&lsquo; If you 're looking for some of your friends , Professor Tamar , &rsquo; he said as he handed me my glass of Nierstein , &lsquo; you 'll find Miss Jardine right at the back there . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #12:1>
He gestured towards the dimly lit interior .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #13:1>
Selena was sitting alone at one of the little oak tables , in an attitude less carefree than one expects of a young barrister in the middle of the summer vacation :
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #14:1>
her blonde head was bent over a set of papers , which she was examining with the critical expression of a Persian cat having doubts about the freshness of its fish .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #15:1>
Reflecting , however , that in the flickering candlelight she could not in fact be attempting to read them , and that in deliberate search of solitude she would hardly have come to the Corkscrew , I did not hesitate to join her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #16:1>
She greeted me with every sign of pleasure , and invited me to tell her the latest news from Oxford &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #17:1>
but I soon perceived , having accepted the invitation , that her attention was elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #18:1>
&lsquo; My dear Selena , &rsquo; I said gently , &lsquo; the story I have been telling you about the curious personal habits of our new Dean was told to the Bursar , in the strictest confidence , only this morning , and may well not be common knowledge until the middle of next week .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #19:1>
It seems a pity to waste it on an unappreciative audience . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #20:1>
She looked apologetic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #21:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry , Hilary .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #22:1>
I 'm afraid I 'm still thinking of some<l>thing I was dealing with this afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #23:1>
I happened to be the only Junior left in Chambers - the others are all on holiday - and the senior partner in Pitkin and Shoon came in in rather a dither , wanting advice in conference as a matter of urgency .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #24:1>
I 'm told he 's quite a good commercial lawyer , but he candidly admits to being completely at sea over anything with a Chancery flavour .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #25:1>
So whenever a trust or a will or anything like that comes his way , he pops into Lincoln 's Inn to get the advice of Counsel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #26:1>
And since the sums involved are generally large enough to justify what might otherwise seem an extravagance , one wouldn't like to discourage him . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #27:1>
I nodded , well understanding that a solicitor such as Mr Pitkin would be cherished by the Chancery Bar like the most golden of geese .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #28:1>
&lsquo; He 's inclined to fuss about things that don't really present any problem , so I thought I 'd be able to put his mind at rest quite easily about whatever it was that was worrying him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #29:1>
The trouble is , I wasn't , and I can't help won<l>dering ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #30:1>
It might help to clear my mind if I could talk it over with someone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #31:1>
If you 'd care to hear about it ... ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #32:1>
&lsquo; My dear Selena , &rsquo; I said , &lsquo; I should be honoured .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #33:1>
I must remind you , however , that I am an historian rather than a lawyer -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #34:1>
on any intricate point of law , I fear that my views will be of but little value . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #35:1>
&lsquo; Oh , &rsquo; said Selena , &lsquo; there 's nothing difficult about the law .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #36:1>
The law 's quite clear , I can advise on it in two sentences .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #37:1>
But the sequence of events , you see , is rather unusual , and in certain circumstances might be thought slightly ... sinister . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #38:1>
The matter on which Mr Pitkin had required advice was the estate , amounting in value to something between three and four million pounds sterling , of his late client Mr Albert Barnsley .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #39:1>
Having acted for Mr Barnsley for many years in connection with various commercial enterprises , he was familiar with the details of his background and private life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #40:1>
He had related these to Selena at greater length than she could at first believe necessary for the purpose of her advising on the devolution of the estate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #41:1>
The late Mr Barnsley ( Mr Pitkin had told her ) was what is termed a self-made man .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #42:1>
Born in Yorkshire , the son of poor but respectable parents , he had left school at the age of sixteen , and after completing his national service had obtained employment in quite a humble capacity with a local manufacturing company .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #43:1>
By the age of forty he had risen to the position of managing director - a sign , as I supposed , that he possessed all those qualities of drive , initiative and enterprise which I am told are required for success in the world of commerce and industry .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #44:1>
&lsquo; Yes , &rsquo; said Selena , thoughtfully sipping her wine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #45:1>
&lsquo; Yes , I suppose he must have had those qualities .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #46:1>
And others , perhaps , which moralists don't seem to value so highly - the ability to make himself agreeable , for example , in particular to women .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #47:1>
His progress was not impeded , at any rate , by the fact that he had married the chairman 's daughter . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #48:1>
&lsquo; Perhaps , &rsquo; I said , &lsquo; she was anxious to be married , and he was her only suitor . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #49:1>
&lsquo; Far from it , apparently .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #50:1>
According to Mr Pitkin , Isabel was a strikingly attractive woman who could have married anyone she wanted , but she set her heart on Albert Barnsley .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #51:1>
Her father , as you might expect , was something less than delighted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #52:1>
But Isabel talked him round in the end , and he gave the young couple his blessing and a rather elegant house to live in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #53:1>
Mind you , he didn't take any more chances than he could help -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #54:1>
he put the house in trust for Isabel and any children she might have , and when he died he left his estate on the same trusts . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #55:1>
&lsquo; So Barnsley did not in fact benefit from his wife 's wealth ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #56:1>
&lsquo; Not directly , no , apart from living in the house , but that 's not quite the point .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #57:1>
I don't say that being the chairman 's son-in-law would mean he could rise without merit , but it would tend to mean , don't you think , that there was less danger of his merits going unrecognized ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #58:1>
And after her father died , of course , Isabel 's trust fund included quite a substantial holding in the company , and her husband could always rely on the trustees to support his decisions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #59:1>
Quite apart from that , Isabel was very skilful at dealing with the other major shareholders -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #60:1>
after all , she 'd known most of them since she was a child .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #61:1>
She was a woman of considerable charm and personality , wholeheartedly devoted to her hus<l>band 's interests , and there doesn't seem to be much doubt that she contributed very significantly to his success . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #62:1>
&lsquo; Were there any children ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #63:1>
&lsquo; One daughter - Amanda , described by Mr Pitkin as something of a tomboy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #64:1>
The sort of girl , he says , who 'd rather have a bicycle for her birthday than a new dress .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #65:1>
Actually it sounds as if she 'd probably have got both , being an object of total adoration on the part of her parents .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #66:1>
Her father in particular was enormously proud of her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #67:1>
People used to ask him sometimes if he wouldn't rather have had a son , and he used to say that Amanda was a son as well as a daughter -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #68:1>
she could do anything a boy could do , he said , and do it a damn sight better .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #69:1>
But I 'm talking of five or six years ago , when Amanda was in her mid-teens .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #70:1>
After that things changed . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #71:1>
Under Mr Barnsley 's management the company had flourished , expanded and in due course been taken over by a larger company .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #72:1>
The takeover was not one which he had any reason to resist :
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #73:1>
his personal shareholding was by now substantial , and the price offered - as well as increasing the value of the funds held in trust for his wife and daughter - was sufficient to make him , as Selena put it , seriously rich .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #74:1>
The terms agreed for the takeover included his appoint<l>ment to a senior position in the company making the acqui<l>sition :
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #75:1>
he was an active and energetic man , still in his forties , and the prospect of retirement held no charms for him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #76:1>
Though his new responsibilities required his presence in London during the working week , he had no wish to sever his connections with his home town or to uproot his family .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #77:1>
He accordingly acquired a small bachelor flat in central London and returned at weekends to the house in Yorkshire .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #78:1>
&lsquo; That is to say , &rsquo; said Selena , &lsquo; he began by doing so .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #79:1>
But after a while the weekends in Yorkshire became less frequent , and eventually ceased altogether .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #80:1>
You will not find it difficult , I imagine , to guess the reason . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #81:1>
&lsquo; I suppose , &rsquo; I said , &lsquo; that he had formed an attachment to some young woman in London - what is termed , I believe , a popsie . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #82:1>
&lsquo; I think , &rsquo; said Selena , &lsquo; that the current expression is bimbo .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #83:1>
Though in the present case that perhaps gives a slightly misleading impression .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #84:1>
Natalie wasn't at all the sort of girl who dresses up in mink and mascara and gets her picture in the Sunday newspapers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #85:1>
There wasn't anything glamorous or sophisticated about her -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #86:1>
she was just a typist in Barnsley 's office .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #87:1>
She was from the same part of the world that he was , and it was her first job in London -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #88:1>
I suppose in a way that gave them something in common , and perhaps made him feel protective towards her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #89:1>
She was young , of course - about twenty-two - and reasonably pretty , but nothing remarkable .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #90:1>
That 's Mr Pitkin 's view , at any rate -
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #91:1>
he found her rather colourless , especially by comparison with Isabel . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #92:1>
It occurred to me that it might have been the contrast with Isabel that Barnsley had found attractive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #93:1>
It was clear that his wife had given him a great deal &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #94:1>
but if it is more blessed to give than receive , then plainly Natalie offered him ampler scope for beatitude .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #95:1>
&lsquo; No doubt , &rsquo; said Selena .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #96:1>
&lsquo; But as you will have gathered , she wasn't the kind of girl who wanted to be given jewellery or dinners at the Savoy or anything like that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #97:1>
It 's rather a pity really , because with a little luck and discretion Barnsley could have had that sort of affair without upsetting anyone , and they would all have lived happily ever after .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #98:1>
But Natalie was the domesticated sort , and wanted to be married .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #99:1>
And he couldn't give her that quite so easily . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #100:1>
Because Isabel declined to divorce him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #101:1>
Mr Pitkin , having reluctantly and with embarrassment accepted instructions to negotiate with her on Mr Barnsley 's behalf , had found her implacable .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #102:1>
There was nothing , she said , to negotiate about :
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #103:1>
she did not want anything from her husband that he was now able to offer her &semi; and she saw no reason to make things easy for him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #104:1>
If she ever found herself in a position , by raising her little finger , to save him from a painful and lingering death , she hoped ( she said ) that she would still have the common humanity to raise it &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #105:1>
but to be candid , she felt some doubt on the matter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #106:1>
Mr Pitkin had perhaps been slightly shocked at the depth of her bitterness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #107:1>
&lsquo; Though it seems to me , &rsquo; said Selena , &lsquo; to be quite under<l>standable .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #108:1>
It must be peculiarly disconcerting , don't you think , to be left for someone entirely different from oneself ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #109:1>
Not just like going into one 's bank and being told there 's no money in one 's account when one thought there was , but like going in and being told one 's never had an account there at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #110:1>
A feeling that all along one must somehow have completely misunderstood the situation . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #111:1>
I asked what Amanda 's attitude had been .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #112:1>
&lsquo; Extreme hostility towards her father .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #113:1>
It was , you may think , very natural and proper that she should take her mother 's side , but I gather it went a good deal further than that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #114:1>
She seems to have felt a sense of personal betrayal . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #115:1>
I thought that too was understandable .
<ICE-GB:W2F-011 #116:1>
When a man forms an attachment to a woman young enough to be his daughter , I suppose that his daughter may feel as deeply injured as his wife &semi; and for Amanda , as for Isabel , it must have been peculiarly wounding that he seemed to love his mistress for qualities precisely opposite to those which he had seemed to value in herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #1:1>
Berlin
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #2:1>
The youthful German policeman on duty at the Invalidenstrasse crossing point cupped his hand over his ear in an attempt to drown out the noise of the passing traffic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #3:1>
Someone was shouting at him through the crackle of his personal radio .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #4:1>
&lsquo; Who ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #5:1>
Schumacher and his wife ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #6:1>
He had never met Edward Schumacher , but the politician 's face had appeared on too many news programmes in recent months for him to go unrecognized .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #7:1>
He looked across to double-check , but it only confirmed what he had already seen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #8:1>
There had been very few vehicles through , what with the boycott , and every new car with its occupants had helped to lift the monotony and received close attention .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #9:1>
&lsquo; Schumacher and a redhead drove through less than a minute ago .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #10:1>
I can see them now , waiting at the checkpoint ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #11:1>
What ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #12:1>
Stop them ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #13:1>
Too late .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #14:1>
They 're already over the line , surrounded by border guards ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #15:1>
He watched as Schumacher 's BMW meandered slowly through the chicane of concrete bollards and barriers designed to guide cars through the customs checks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #16:1>
There was only one car ahead of them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #17:1>
The border guards were methodical , slow , inspecting documents , vehicle registrations , driving licences , car boots .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #18:1>
They were obviously bored , one of them even getting down on his knees to look under the car , grateful for the exercise .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #19:1>
Eventually it was waved through , the final red-and-white barrier rising to let it past , and then it was Schumacher 's turn .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #20:1>
Two guards examined the BMW , while a third took their various documents inside the ugly concrete guard house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #21:1>
&lsquo; Turning up like tourists , Edward ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #22:1>
I thought at least you would have a military guard of honour . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #23:1>
Katherine made no attempt to disguise the contempt in her voice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #24:1>
&lsquo; You don't believe I would have survived so long if every border guard along the Wall knew who I was , do you ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #25:1>
As far as these idiots are concerned I 'm just another humble West Berlin businessman and politician . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #26:1>
&lsquo; I thought you telephoned ahead ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #27:1>
&lsquo; No .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #28:1>
That was something else entirely ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #29:1>
A sense of calm and security had taken hold of Schumacher .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #30:1>
He noticed that his hands were no longer trembling , and he smiled in contentment and relief .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #31:1>
He was back home at last , safe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #32:1>
For the first time in his life he had no need to be in fear , and nothing any more to hide .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #33:1>
&lsquo; When can I see my son ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #34:1>
The question punctured his euphoria .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #35:1>
It disturbed him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #36:1>
He didn't look at Katherine &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #37:1>
he offered no reply .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #38:1>
&lsquo; When can I see him ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #39:1>
Her tone was insistent now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #40:1>
She had seen something , some mark of evasiveness , a slight twitch trembling around his lips , and after all these years she recognized the signs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #41:1>
&lsquo; You 're lying , Edward , aren't you ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #42:1>
You 're not going to let me see him ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #43:1>
No need to be in fear , and nothing any more to hide ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #44:1>
For the first time in their lives together it was the moment to be honest with her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #45:1>
&lsquo; Your son died at the Wall the night you came across .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #46:1>
Yes , I lied to you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #47:1>
She had been sustained only by the tension and the hope , by the reawakening of a dream she had never dared let die for twenty years : that her baby lived .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #48:1>
Now , in an instant , it was all gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #49:1>
Her face drained , her shoulders sagged , the spirit and fight which had been within her crumbled to dust and was blown away .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #50:1>
&lsquo; Why ? &rsquo; she whispered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #51:1>
&lsquo; Why did you have to lie to me ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #52:1>
Why did you let me believe ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #53:1>
She was pleading with him , willing him to take back his words and tell her that it was a cruel and senseless joke , but knowing all the time that the deception was finally over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #54:1>
&lsquo; Because I needed your co-operation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #55:1>
You had a gun on me ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #56:1>
remember ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #57:1>
His fingers closed over his pocket to reassure him<l>self that the weapon was still safely in his possession .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #58:1>
&lsquo; And we needed you over here , safe in the East , while we find out precisely what you know .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #59:1>
Your knowledge , whether you are aware of it or not , could put a lot of my friends at risk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #60:1>
We have to give ourselves a little time to reorganize and get them back to safety .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #61:1>
So I regret you will have to be a guest of our glorious People 's Republic for a little while .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #62:1>
I 'm afraid the people will insist . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #63:1>
She didn't respond .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #64:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry , Katherine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #65:1>
After all these years ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #66:1>
He didn't continue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #67:1>
There was little point in trying to find words which could never sufficiently explain or console .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #68:1>
He was talking to a shell .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #69:1>
Katherine 's features were ghostly , haggard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #70:1>
There was no sign of life left in her face .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #71:1>
Her eyes were glazed , unfocused , trying to peer into a distant past which now seemed to be lost for ever .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #72:1>
The guard still hadn't come out of the blockhouse with their papers &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #73:1>
they were taking their own sweet time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #74:1>
Schumacher peered through the window and saw two of them gesticulating in their direction .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #75:1>
They were inspecting an identity card , and looking closely at Katherine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #76:1>
Sheisse !
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #77:1>
A Fluchtling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #78:1>
A Wall Rat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #79:1>
A refugee who had fled illegally from East Berlin many years ago and who was now trying to get back in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #80:1>
Of course they were suspicious .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #81:1>
He would have to explain the situation to their senior officer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #82:1>
Still , there was no rush .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #83:1>
He had all the time in the world .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #84:1>
The small group of onlookers presented a pathetic sight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #85:1>
The soldiers stood dejectedly around the jeep , gesticulating and argu<l>ing among themselves .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #86:1>
Ahead of them on the white line painted across the road at the very edge of the checkpoint , Miss Picker<l>staff stood alone , slowly clenching her fists in rage and frus<l>tration as she watched her prey less than a hundred yards away , so close yet too far for her to lift a finger to prevent their escape .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #87:1>
All Harry could do was to look on in bewilderment , squashed between two military guards in the back of the car , an impotent and uncomprehending onlooker .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #88:1>
There was only one small bar<l>rier to be raised before both Schumacher and Katherine would be lost to him for ever .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #89:1>
He wasn't sure which loss he would feel most keenly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #90:1>
&lsquo; Bring him out here , &rsquo; instructed Miss Pickerstaff .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #91:1>
The guards hustled Harry out of the car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #92:1>
&lsquo; Your bird has flown , &rsquo; she muttered between gritted teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #93:1>
&lsquo; And your alibi with her . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #94:1>
&lsquo; She 's innocent , I tell you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #95:1>
He must have found some way to force her . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #96:1>
&lsquo; Look , Benjamin !
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #97:1>
Use your eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #98:1>
Are you trying to tell me she 's putting up a struggle ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #99:1>
They could both see very clearly that Schumacher and Katherine were sitting totally passively in the car , waiting to be waved through .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #100:1>
There was no struggle , no angry words , no sign of protest .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #101:1>
&lsquo; It 's not what it seems .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #102:1>
I know she wouldn't cross willingly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #103:1>
&lsquo; Give it a rest , Benjamin .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #104:1>
They 're gone and the game 's up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #105:1>
We 'll just have to make do with you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #106:1>
He could see what she meant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #107:1>
He had managed to convince her that Schumacher was a traitor , but instead of accolades he was under arrest , accused of assisting him to escape .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #108:1>
His career was in ruins , and Katherine was about to pass from his life for ever .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #109:1>
He could see her , or at least the back of her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #110:1>
It hung down , dejected .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #111:1>
As he looked he knew this was not a woman about to achieve happy release , more a woman about to be cast into damnation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #112:1>
She was innocent , he knew , no matter what they would say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #113:1>
But he couldn't save her , any more than he could save himself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #114:1>
He saw her head lift slightly and begin to turn .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #115:1>
She wanted one parting look at the West , at everything she was leaving behind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #116:1>
Her life had now come full circle and she was back where she started , in misery , alone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #117:1>
As she turned , her eyes met Harry 's .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #118:1>
He saw a flicker of recognition - he saw love there , too , he was certain - before it died , leaving only a hollow , haunted expression , like a soul peering out of the inferno .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #119:1>
He was watching her being destroyed right in front of him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #120:1>
He would never thereafter know precisely why he did what he did next .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #121:1>
Was it for Katherine ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #122:1>
Or for himself ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #123:1>
All he could focus on was the haunted look in her eyes , and know he would never be able to live in peace with that memory .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #124:1>
The jeep was less than thirty feet away , with the driver standing up behind the wheel to get a better view of the border post .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #125:1>
Harry hurled himself at the soldier , knocking him off his feet and right out of the vehicle , leaving Harry as the sole occupant and in the driving seat .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #126:1>
He was only yards from the other guards but he had the advantage of surprise .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #127:1>
By the time they had heard the driver 's shout of alarm and comprehended what was going on , Harry already had the jeep started and in gear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #128:1>
He released the handbrake and clutch together , and the squeal of tortured rubber drowned their shouts of protest as the tyres spun on the ground before gaining grip and propelling the vehicle forward .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #129:1>
As the others rushed towards him one of the guards unholstered his gun and waved it in his direction , but couldn't get a clear line of fire .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #130:1>
Harry found himself hurtl<l>ing towards the checkpoint .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #131:1>
The last thing he saw before he pas<l>sed the first barrier was the look of astonishment on Miss Pickerstaff 's face as she turned to see him at the wheel of the jeep bearing directly down on her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #132:1>
He passed within inches , and above the roar of the highly revved engine he could just make out her high-pitched squeak : &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #133:1>
Shoot him !
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #134:1>
Shoot him ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #135:1>
But it was too late .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #136:1>
He was already hurling the vehicle around the first bollard , the four-wheel drive giving him the ability to force his way through the carefully prepared chicane much faster than an ordinary vehicle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #137:1>
On the other side of the checkpoint , the shouts of alarm and sound of scorching rubber could be clearly heard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #138:1>
Every guard on duty in the East turned to see the cause of the commotion , to discover a US military vehicle racing through the checkpoint and away from a group of US soldiers , one of whom was waving a gun in protest .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #139:1>
This was not a situation the East Germans were used to &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #140:1>
they had never known of anyone trying to escape to the East before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #141:1>
And in any event , if the US military were trying to stop him , even shoot him , the man must have some<l>thing very valuable in his possession .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #142:1>
So confusion reigned and not a gun was drawn in the East .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #143:1>
The concrete and steel chicane was meant to slow vehicles down for the customs check , not stop them completely like the tank traps of old .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #144:1>
The border guards watched , paralysed with uncertainty as Harry wrenched the jeep around the last concrete bollard , thrust up through the gears and headed straight for Schumacher 's BMW .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #145:1>
He was squeezing as much speed as poss<l>ible out of the jeep and concentrating on forcing the vehicle through the narrow passage of the checkpoint .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #146:1>
It was only a small slip of the hand as it wrestled with the steering wheel , but Harry was already doing forty and accelerating when he nudged the kerbstone and started to climb .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #147:1>
The jeep , already defying the laws of the East Berlin authorities , now also seemed to defy the laws of gravity and leaped sharply into the air .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #148:1>
Schumacher turned in his car seat to make out what was going on , and could scarcely comprehend what he saw .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #149:1>
Less than fifty feet away a US military jeep was flying through the air , headed straight for him , with a demented Harry Benjamin as its pilot .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #150:1>
Schumacher knew what this was .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #151:1>
They were after him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #152:1>
A snatch squad , about to pounce , desperate to haul him back to the West .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #153:1>
The jeep arched gracelessly through the air and Harry had to fasten with all his strength on to the steering wheel to prevent himself being thrown out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #154:1>
The sights of the checkpoint per<l>formed a crazy ballet in front of him , his backside parted company with the seat and he had no control , waiting for the vehicle to make contact with the ground once again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #155:1>
When it did so it hit with a force which tried to drive his whole body back through the chassis and scrambled his senses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #156:1>
He felt as if his spine was six inches shorter and he could taste warm blood in his mouth from the lip he had just bitten .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #157:1>
But these were the least of his concerns .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #158:1>
His only thought was that he must almost be upon Schumacher .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #159:1>
Harry 's jeep rammed the BMW from behind with a sound that would have done justice to a Detroit wrecker 's yard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #160:1>
Metal ground on metal before being bent and torn , and glass was smashed and shattered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-012 #161:1>
The jeep 's engine died and the BMW was shunted several yards forward , its rear-end reduced to a concertina of warped bodywork , gaping holes where the brake lights had once been , and an exhaust bent askew and trailing on the ground .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #1:1>
PATIENCE
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #2:1>
It had been a long journey down -
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #3:1>
twenty-four hours it had taken .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #4:1>
That 's because we had come the cheapest way possible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #5:1>
First of all by train and boat , then train again and finally a tedious two hours by bus .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #6:1>
The hotel room , which had been booked for us by the Continental Travel Agency , was small and cramped but otherwise clean .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #7:1>
Somewhat dazed , I stared over the balcony outside the window .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #8:1>
My sister Mary Jane squeezed in beside me at the rail .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #9:1>
&lsquo; This isn't bad at all &rsquo; , she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #10:1>
&lsquo; What do you think ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #11:1>
&lsquo; Where 's the sea ? &rsquo; I asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #12:1>
Although the holiday brochure had said the village was close to the Mediterranean , from where I stood we appeared to be in a valley - white cliffs on one side , rolling hills on the other and , facing us in the distance , a range of shadowy mountains .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #13:1>
&lsquo; It can't be far away , &rsquo; said Mary Jane , swivelling her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #14:1>
&lsquo; Isn't that a castle on top of the cliff ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #15:1>
&lsquo; Where ? &rsquo; I asked , but now she was pointing down at the courtyard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #16:1>
&lsquo; Look at that fountain , all gushing with water !
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #17:1>
And those apartments over there by the river with their balconies and shutters .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #18:1>
It 's just how I imagined how a French village would be - and all this lovely heat too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #19:1>
That 's what I miss most about India - the heat &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #20:1>
&lsquo; It is warm , &rsquo; I said , wiping my clammy forehead , &lsquo; But you 'd have thought there 'd be more people about &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #21:1>
Down below the square was deserted apart from one old woman in dark clothes shuffling along the pavement with a bundle of sticks under her arm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #22:1>
&lsquo; Isn't this place supposed to be a popular tourist attraction ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #23:1>
&lsquo; The tourist season will be over by now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #24:1>
And I think it 's perfect the way it is , slow moving and tranquil and all this sun .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #25:1>
What more could one ask for ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #26:1>
When I looked back at the small bedroom , barely big enough for one , I began to wish that we 'd asked for separate rooms after all , but the booking had been done very much at the last minute , and it was probably too late now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #27:1>
And I supposed it was all very nice really , but being so hot and tired I wasn't in the mood to appreciate anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #28:1>
Mary Jane suggested that after we 'd had some lunch we could take a stroll along by the river , but all I wanted was to lie down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #29:1>
&lsquo; Actually I was thinking of having a rest afterwards , &rsquo; I said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #30:1>
&lsquo; A rest ? &rsquo; she said incredulously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #31:1>
&lsquo; On the first day of our holiday ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #32:1>
&lsquo; But I 'm tired .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #33:1>
It would only be an hour at the most . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #34:1>
&lsquo; Honest to God , Dorothy - didn't you have enough sleep on the bus ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #35:1>
She went on to say that she hoped I wasn't going to spoil everything by being tired all the time for in that case I should have stayed at home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #36:1>
I thought that was a good one .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #37:1>
She knew I hadn't wanted to come - but she 'd harped on so much about it that I 'd finally given in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #38:1>
&lsquo; We might never get another chance at our age , &rsquo; she 'd said at the time , mentioning father as an example of how easily one could go into decline .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #39:1>
It never seemed to occur to Mary Jane to worry about money .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #40:1>
Ever since she came home from abroad after father died - only for a visit , she said , but that was two years ago - she 'd been spending it like water .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #41:1>
Nor did it occur to her that half shares might be a bit unfair when I was the one who stayed at home to take care of him while she went gallivanting all over the world &lsquo; having a wonderful time &rsquo; , as she said on her postcards .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #42:1>
It was hard not to be bitter at times , but I tried to put the past out of my mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #43:1>
There was the future to consider , after all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #44:1>
Now she was saying &lsquo; After all , you 're only fifty-six - just two years older than me and look at you - fat as a pudding .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #45:1>
It 's exercise you need , not rest . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #46:1>
&lsquo; I 'll see how I feel later , &rsquo; I said , thinking I 'd rather be fat as a pudding than thin as a rake like her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #47:1>
Lunch was served in the restaurant downstairs by the proprietor himself - a Monsieur Savlon whom we 'd met briefly when we arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #48:1>
Weary though I was , I 'd been stuck on his singular appearance .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #49:1>
He was almost as short as he was broad and without a single hair on his head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #50:1>
As if to make up for this his beard grew very thick and black .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #51:1>
The meal he laid before us was heavy with sauce , and the predominant flavour was garlic , which I cannot stand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #52:1>
I left half of it on my plate and drank almost a jugful of water to get rid of the taste .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #53:1>
When Monsieur Savlon came back to clear the table he asked me in perfectly good English , &lsquo; You do not like snails ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #54:1>
I shook my head and hurried off to the toilet where I was violently sick .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #55:1>
Fifteen minutes later Mary Jane came up to the room and found me lying on top of the bed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #56:1>
&lsquo; You really are the limit , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #57:1>
&lsquo; Don't you know snails are a delicacy ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #58:1>
&lsquo; I don't want to know anything , &rsquo; I said , turning on my side and closing my eyes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #59:1>
The next thing I knew she was towering above me in a long white cotton nightdress .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #60:1>
&lsquo; What time is it ? &rsquo; I asked , for one horrible moment thinking it was father .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #61:1>
For the last few years before he died he had worn a night-shirt that looked much the same .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #62:1>
&lsquo; You may well ask , &rsquo; she said , the freckles of her face standing out like half-pence pieces .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #63:1>
&lsquo; You 've been asleep for almost a day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #64:1>
I don't know how often I tried to wake you up but you simply refused .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #65:1>
I was really fed up.
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #66:1>
I can tell you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #67:1>
And on top of that Monsieur Savlon kept asking about you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #68:1>
I didn't know what to say . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #69:1>
&lsquo; I 'm sorry , &rsquo; I said , forcing myself off the bed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #70:1>
I went out on to the balcony where the air was pleasantly cool .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #71:1>
A mist hung over the river .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #72:1>
The streets and the apartments looked fresh and sparkling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #73:1>
There was that air of expectancy about the place you get first thing on a fine morning .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #74:1>
I began to feel remarkably well .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #75:1>
&lsquo; Let 's go out as soon as we 've had breakfast , &rsquo; I suggested , &lsquo; &lsquo; and see as much as we can before it gets too hot .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #76:1>
We could even take a picnic to save us coming back for lunch .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #77:1>
I 'm sure Monsieur Savlon wouldn't mind . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #78:1>
Mary Jane frowned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #79:1>
&lsquo; I hope you don't expect me to run around like a mad thing just because you 've had a good rest .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #80:1>
I haven't unpacked my things yet and I 'll have to think about what to wear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #81:1>
I hate being rushed . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #82:1>
I stifled a sigh .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #83:1>
&lsquo; All right , we won't rush . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #84:1>
In the restaurant Monsieur Savlon came over with a pot of coffee and a plate piled high with toast .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #85:1>
&lsquo; You like ? &rsquo; he asked , his hands wavering over jars of honey , marmalade and jam .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #86:1>
I nodded my head earnestly to wipe out any bad impressions I had given him previously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #87:1>
&lsquo; You want more ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #88:1>
&lsquo; No thanks , &rsquo; said Mary Jane .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #89:1>
&lsquo; This looks very appetising , &rsquo; I said , and flushed , for no good reason I could think of .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #90:1>
&lsquo; What a fussy little man he is , &rsquo; said Mary Jane .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #91:1>
&lsquo; He 's only doing his best to please us , &rsquo; I said , biting into a slice of toast and honey .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #92:1>
When my plate was clean I asked her if she would mind telling him when she got the chance that I couldn't stand snails or garlic , but that this was no reflection on his excellent cooking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #93:1>
&lsquo; Tell him yourself , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #94:1>
&lsquo; It doesn't matter , &rsquo; I said , for I didn't want to admit that I sometimes feel shy with foreigners .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #95:1>
I knew she would only jeer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #96:1>
Mary Jane took a long time unpacking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #97:1>
Then she couldn't decide what to wear .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #98:1>
&lsquo; Do you think I should put this on ? &rsquo; she said , holding up a dark blue dress which she had brought back from India , of a material so fine it was almost transparent. &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #99:1>
Why not ? &rsquo; I said ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #100:1>
&lsquo; It looks cool . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #101:1>
She studied it , frowning .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #102:1>
Then she shoved it back into the wardrobe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #103:1>
&lsquo; It 's not casual enough for walking , &rsquo; she complained .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #104:1>
&lsquo; Anyone can see that . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #105:1>
Finally she settled for a pair of shorts and a T-shirt , saying that she might as well be comfortable .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #106:1>
I thought that her thin white legs would be better covered up , but there was no point in saying so , for she 'd always go against anything I suggested .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #107:1>
All the same , I began to feel overdressed in my skirt and blouse , so as a gesture of freedom I took off my tights .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #108:1>
We were a few yards away from the hotel when I remembered that I 'd forgotten to ask Monsieur Savlon for a picnic basket .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #109:1>
I didn't mention this , however , for Mary Jane would have insisted on turning back and with the sun out in full force I was already too hot to be bothered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #110:1>
As we were passing the fountain Mary Jane brought a camera out of her bag and took a snapshot of the water gushing from the lion 's mouth into a basin floating with dead leaves .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #111:1>
&lsquo; What 's so special about that ? &rsquo; I asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #112:1>
&lsquo; It will look splendid when it 's enlarged and framed , &rsquo; she said , looking at me pityingly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #113:1>
&lsquo; I do know what I 'm talking about when it comes to photography , you know . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #114:1>
When we were walking over the bridge Mary Jane stopped to take a shot of a woman on the other side of the road who was dragging a child along by the hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #115:1>
When the woman began to shout angrily I hurried ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #116:1>
&lsquo; You shouldn't do that to people , &rsquo; I said , when Mary Jane caught up with me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #117:1>
&lsquo; If you want to take photos of people we can take each other . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #118:1>
I turned down some steps which led to the riverbank .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #119:1>
&lsquo; It 's characterization I want , not stodgy snaps of each other .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #120:1>
Anyway , where are you going ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #121:1>
I never said I wanted to go this way . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #122:1>
&lsquo; I thought you wanted to walk by the river . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #123:1>
&lsquo; I wanted to go to the castle , &rsquo; she said huffily , shoving the camera back into her bag as if she had no further use for it , &lsquo; but it seems I 've no choice . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #124:1>
When we reached a spot shaded by trees I said that I would have to sit down since my new sandals were rubbing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #125:1>
&lsquo; Oh no ! &rsquo; she groaned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #126:1>
&lsquo; But look , &rsquo; I said , undoing the straps and showing her my heels , which were blistered and bleeding .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #127:1>
&lsquo; You should have kept on your tights , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #128:1>
&lsquo; What do we do now - go back ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #129:1>
She gave a hollow laugh and lay down on the grass with her hands behind her head .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #130:1>
I could have wept with vexation at this point , but I knew it would be a mistake .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #131:1>
Mary Jane has a cruel streak that thrives on my tears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #132:1>
&lsquo; What 's wrong with staying here ? &rsquo; I said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #133:1>
&lsquo; It 's cool and pleasant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #134:1>
At least we 're outside . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #135:1>
&lsquo; I 'm bored , &rsquo; said Mary Jane .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #136:1>
&lsquo; That 's what 's wrong .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #137:1>
And anyway , you forgot to bring the picnic basket , didn't you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #138:1>
The lunch was good - cold salmon and salad .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #139:1>
&lsquo; No garlic , &rsquo; said Monsieur Savlon with a twinkle in his eye .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #140:1>
I wondered how he knew about the garlic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #141:1>
Perhaps Mary Jane had told him after all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #142:1>
She was in a good mood now , smiling broadly as she clutched her glass of wine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #143:1>
She had ordered a bottle , which I thought was far too much for so early in the day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #144:1>
By the time we had finished the meal more diners had arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #145:1>
I was glad for Monsieur Savlon 's sake , because until now trade had been poor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #146:1>
After lunch Mary Jane offered to go into the village to buy some Elastoplast for my heels .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #147:1>
I told her I 'd be very grateful &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #148:1>
at the same time I wondered how she was going to manage this , for she must have put away four or five glasses of wine by now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #149:1>
As I watched her leave I noticed that she was walking very straight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #150:1>
Too straight , I thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #151:1>
An hour later she came back and told me she 'd been wandering round the village and had seen some wonderful sights .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #152:1>
There was one street in particular , she said enthusiastically , that had the most amazing houses - all different shapes and sizes with cute little courtyards filled with the most amazing flowers and plants .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #153:1>
What a pity I hadn't been with her.
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #154:1>
Then she gave a large yawn and slumped into the chair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #155:1>
&lsquo; Did you remember the Elastoplast ? &rsquo; I asked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #156:1>
&lsquo; Goodness , &rsquo; she said , &lsquo; I completely forgot . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #157:1>
Dinner that evening was an excellent steak followed by a souffl&eacute; so light that it melted on the tongue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #158:1>
Mary Jane however , sat drowsily throughout the meal and eventually said she 'd have to have an early night since the heat had completely worn her out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #159:1>
Much later I sat out on the balcony in the dark .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #160:1>
There was nothing to see except the reflections of the bridge and the apartments cast upon the river by the street lamps .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #161:1>
Behind me Mary Jane lay snoring .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #162:1>
I looked at my watch .
<ICE-GB:W2F-013 #163:1>
It was only half past nine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #1:1>
( i ) Wartime at the Record
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #2:1>
I have few photographs of Father , none taken at Clempstone , half-a-dozen at Manfield Terrace with Deirdre or at official functions , where the Buster Keaton features are firmly in place , so that it would be wrong to say he looked either happy or sad .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #3:1>
He is serious ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #4:1>
that is all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #5:1>
There is only one in which he looks utterly relaxed , obviously happy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #6:1>
It was taken in the late Forties after he married Norma , in the tiny garden of the house in Fulham they bought after Manfield Terrace was bombed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #7:1>
He has an arm round her waist ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #8:1>
they are looking at each other lovingly , both laughing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #9:1>
I examine this snap minutely , linger over it , wonder whether I have ever looked at any woman like that , and conclude that I probably haven't , except for Melissa long ago .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #10:1>
Proof positive that Leila 's right -
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #11:1>
I don't live in the present ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #12:1>
Or that I feel emotion , but like Father for most of his life can't show it ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #13:1>
After talking to Mrs Rackley I looked again at this photo<l>graph , and thought again how remote we had been from each other .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #14:1>
It was difficult to believe in the reality of what she told me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #15:1>
He had fathered a child upon an unknown woman ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #16:1>
for some reason it had been impossible for them to marry - or of course either he or she had not wanted to marry - and they had got rid of the baby almost as soon as it was born .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #17:1>
Very likely its birth had not been registered , and there was something ruthless about the way in which he had abandoned responsibility for Morgan at the age of fourteen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #18:1>
It occurred to me that the story and the photograph would have given Hugo a basis for trying to black<l>mail Father , but even as such thoughts occupied my mind I was aware that there was more I should know , even though the knowledge might be distressing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #19:1>
The inadequacies of our own relationship of father and son , the real but stifled affection , the things we never said to each other , the gestures felt but unmade , were no doubt responsible for my desire to find out what I flinched from .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #20:1>
The only people who might be able to tell me more about that time were Aggie , and possibly Dodo .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #21:1>
Aggie , certainly , must know things she would be reluctant to talk about , and I resolved to be insistent , even brutal , about my right to have this skeleton revealed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #22:1>
Brutality , however , is a matter of temperament , and can't be called up to order .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #23:1>
No doubt it is fortunate that I was never called on to attempt it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #24:1>
There is no doubt at all that Father was happy with Norma , something I admit reluctantly because I never really liked her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #25:1>
I could never get rid of the feeling that she was responsible for his buying all the Prattertons , and that through them she had somehow enticed him into marriage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #26:1>
Even though I believed these thoughts to be unjust I didn't stop thinking them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #27:1>
Norma was several years his junior , dark-haired , a good cook and housewife , what people call a jolly woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #28:1>
She did her best to make me feel that when we were all together we made a genuine threesome , not a twosome plus a member of the awkward squad .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #29:1>
And the Prattertons turned out to have been a good investment , although of course they weren't bought with that in mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #30:1>
After he died she asked if I would like any of them , and when I said no , told me she would be selling them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #31:1>
&lsquo; They were Hal 's taste , not mine . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #32:1>
( She was the only person I ever knew who called him Hal . )
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #33:1>
At Christie 's they fetched double or more what he had paid for them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #34:1>
All this I dutifully put down , but the fact remains that I didn't like Norma .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #35:1>
They stayed in London throughout the war , cohabiting in Manfield Terrace where , after my move to the Daily Record , I occupied my old room until the V1 wrecked the house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #36:1>
Like most sizeable houses ours became cold , dank , inevitably to some extent neglected , as fuel ran short and central heating boilers grew rusty with disuse , household help disappeared , necessary repairs were left undone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #37:1>
Mrs Wellstood left for a haven in Cornwall when the first bombs fell on London , and household work was done by one or another ancient crone tottering round with dustpan and brush , flicking at tables and chairs with a duster .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #38:1>
Branksome and Elder continued to exist in an attenuated form , and with a reduced and ageing staff .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #39:1>
There was little buying and selling of houses in London during those years when the continued existence of any property was a matter of chance , but peers and commoners in Northumberland and Cumberland , Devon and Cornwall , still called on Brank<l>some and Elder for advice in maintaining estates and selling houses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #40:1>
Father did not consider his visits to these areas , where rationing was almost unknown and bombs no more than a rumour , as a holiday from the trials and terrors of London in wartime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #41:1>
He was happy to return to Manfield Terrace and to Norma , and often said so .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #42:1>
The art gallery where she worked closed down , and she found a job in the Central Office of Information which was to do with the photographic side of the many brochures and pamphlets produced to keep our spirits high .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #43:1>
The general free-and-easiness of wartime life was reflected in the number of her friends and acquaintances , including those on leave from the forces , who found a bed for the night on the top floor .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #44:1>
Dodo came down occasionally , and once or twice a business acquaintance of Father 's stayed the night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #45:1>
He accepted all this with a relaxed joviality that surprised me , and even made a joke or two about the inessential nature of papers like the Record .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #46:1>
He also said more than once that it was time I settled down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #47:1>
My move to London came about , again , through Justin .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #48:1>
Some time late in the fine summer of 1940 , after Dunkirk and when German invasion was expected almost any day , meetings were held in towns all over the country to prepare some organised resistance , although in view of the shortage of weapons it was lucky that the guerrilla warfare in preparation for which we drilled with ancient Lee-Enfields at best and broomsticks at worst , never took place .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #49:1>
( Yes , I joined the local Home Guard , having been turned down for military service because of my asthma . )
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #50:1>
I reported some of these meetings for the paper , including one addressed by a mayor , a retired colonel who was head of the local Home Guard , and a civilian from the Ministry of Defence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #51:1>
After the meeting the man from the Ministry gave me some predictable quotes about putting our shoulders to the wheel and all pulling together , and was then taken aside for a whispered conference by somebody in uniform with a captain 's three pips on his shoulder .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #52:1>
He raised his head , and I saw that it was Justin at the same moment that he recognised me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #53:1>
He took me to what he called a place round the corner , a kind of club where youngish men , all civilians , sat in twos and threes at little tables with drinks in front of them , talking in low voices .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #54:1>
Some of them looked up and then away , and one man nodded to Justin who nodded back , but otherwise the quiet chatters were undisturbed by the sight of a uniform .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #55:1>
We sat at our own little table and drank gin and tonic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #56:1>
I asked what he was doing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #57:1>
&lsquo; Just attached here and there , old boy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #58:1>
It 's hush-hush ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #59:1>
I can't really explain . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #60:1>
&lsquo; What happened to M F H ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #61:1>
&lsquo; Suspended for the duration .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #62:1>
Word is , milk will soon be on the ration .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #63:1>
Anyway , there 's no future in M F H , not much in any<l>thing at the moment , the way things look .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #64:1>
How about you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #65:1>
He didn't actually ask why I was in civvies , but the look did it for him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #66:1>
&lsquo; You don't mean to say you 're still with old Jerry 's lot ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #67:1>
Must be like living in a mausoleum .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #68:1>
How 's the old b , or I should say my esteemed father ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #69:1>
Don't suppose you see much of him these days . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #70:1>
I said he was well , and asked how Justin knew the club we were in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #71:1>
&lsquo; Used to have one of our milk-bars in Maidstone ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #72:1>
got rid of it within a couple of months after Adolf went into Poland .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #73:1>
What you might call foresight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #74:1>
But I 've done a bit of business here , know a few people . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #75:1>
He went on to gossip about life in London , told me over-to-you Claude had had a heart attack , and half an hour later caught a train back to town .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #76:1>
I saw him off at the station .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #77:1>
As he got into a first-class carriage he sketched a mock salute , and gave me a great wink .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #78:1>
A couple of days later he rang me at the office .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #79:1>
&lsquo; Don Boswell at the Record has an opening for a bright vital young reporter , Army reject ideally suitable , must be honourable , fearless , eager , all the things young reporters are .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #80:1>
Only those named Geoffrey Elder need apply . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #81:1>
In due course I rang Boswell , got the job , and stayed with the paper through the rest of the war and for a couple of years after it ended .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #82:1>
They were extraordinary years for journalists , and for the papers they served .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #83:1>
As country after country fell under Hitler 's control newsprint was rationed , and the effect was drastic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #84:1>
When I joined the Record it was down to six pages from its pre-war sixteen or twenty , and shortly after the bombing of London began the six became four .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #85:1>
Most of the news was about the war , so what need was there for reporters , what was there for them to write about ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #86:1>
And when almost every story not directly con<l>cerned with the war was limited to a couple of paragraphs or less , how did we occupy our time ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #87:1>
Well , staffs were small and we stayed remarkably busy , with reporters doubling up at times as sub-editors and doing all sorts of other jobs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #88:1>
My activities ranged from sweeping up broken glass after the air raids which punctuated my first year on the paper , to acting as editor for a couple of weeks when Boswell 's house received a direct hit and he was killed , together with his wife and son .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #89:1>
( His editorial replacement was named Johnson . )
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #90:1>
And there were stories to be written even in our limited space , snappy pars about the hoarder who accumulated 774 tins of food , and about the oldest inhabitant of the Isle of Wight dying aged a hundred and three .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #91:1>
And not only snappy pars , but genuine news stories .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #92:1>
I spent a couple of nights in the Underground at the height of the blitz , and wrote what we called a heart-throb about the courage and cheerfulness universally displayed , along with some allegedly factual stuff supplied by the Central Office of Information about the miles of three-tier bunks put up in various Stations , and the thousands of gallons of tea served .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #93:1>
And I remember a piece called &lsquo; If the Beast Does Invade &rsquo; ( Johnson 's headline , not mine ) saying that the pikes recently issued to the Home Guard would be extremely useful in the hand-to-hand street fighting that was bound to take place .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #94:1>
Of course the pikes were issued because there were no rifles , but did I write that piece tongue in cheek ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #95:1>
I doubt it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #96:1>
When bombs are falling daily , buildings being destroyed , people you know being killed , reporters coming back from battlefields talking about the heroic resistance of outgunned and badly led troops , you feel criticism and complaint from those at home would be a stab in the back for those actually fighting .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #97:1>
At least , that 's how I felt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #98:1>
When the blitz on London ended , and for a year or more we had quiet nights , a sense of disappointment was mixed with natural relief .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #99:1>
It seemed one was no longer truly participating in the war .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #100:1>
The V1 bombs which began in 1944 were somehow too impersonal to rouse the same feelings .
<ICE-GB:W2F-014 #101:1>
After the war ended I became bored with the Record , with newspapers generally , and the hard-drinking girl-bedding life that seemed a natural accompaniment to working in wartime Fleet Street .

<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #26:1>
THE first check to their headlong progress came when a tank clattered over a crossing just ahead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #27:1>
Even their sergeant , drunk as he was on his own daring , decided not to tangle with that and braked with a screech , swearing furiously .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #28:1>
&lsquo; Turn right , &rsquo; said Stephen , on his knees , one hand grasping the seat in front .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #29:1>
&lsquo; Right ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #30:1>
The sergeant sounded surprised , as if he had actually expected to drive them all the way to Forla 's pink front door , and swerved so sharply they nearly collided with the tank after all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #31:1>
&lsquo; Right again , &rsquo; said Stephen at the next intersection and immedi<l>ately they were back in the narrow streets , passers-by staring curi<l>ously now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #32:1>
Such a glittering vehicle as this might occasionally be seen elsewhere in the city , but never in their lives had these ragged , undernourished people seen a pale blue Jaguar roadster in their dirty alleys , the gold insignia of General Forla glinting malignantly as it passed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #33:1>
Soon , they reached an area of run-down or shuttered small fac<l>tories and workshops , the economic life of Mananga long since spilled in ruins &semi; dumps , tin shanties , potholes which made even a Jaguar leap .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #34:1>
No soldiers here , although those waiting squads in trucks were only minutes away .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #35:1>
&lsquo; See if there 's cover to pull up somewhere behind a wall , &rsquo; said Stephen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #36:1>
He had Forla 's revolver in his hand &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #37:1>
he , Jean and Saul were on the back seat now , the soldier squeezed into their place on the floor , where he seemed to be praying .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #38:1>
A crowd of children stared up from where they played in the dust as the Jaguar passed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #39:1>
Not too many adults here , but someone would report whichever way they went :
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #40:1>
what they needed now was an inconspicuous vehicle and darkness ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #41:1>
instead they had a pale blue Jaguar and the sun lifting higher in a cloudless sky .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #42:1>
Jean 's own mind had become disconcertingly incapable of hold<l>ing more than one thought at a time , and the moment strain eased by a fraction it filled with the memory of how , less than an hour before , she had killed a man .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #43:1>
Not Forla , but Lewis Anderson , a man she had known and for whom she had wanted to find excuses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #44:1>
Even now , she was able to imagine that he had started setting up deals with Forla for the same reason Stephen stole food and trains : to get results .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #45:1>
But then he caught the infection of violence and hate raging through Mananga &semi; ultimately needed to fight to keep him<l>self safe .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #46:1>
Until , in the end , she happened to be the one who killed him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #47:1>
A tremble spread outward from her spine until the earth itself seemed to shake , an earth where the same sun rose as yester<l>day , the same scents drifted on the wind &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #48:1>
only she was so different that she didn't belong there any more .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #49:1>
Stephen glanced at her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #50:1>
&lsquo; Don't think about it , only what comes next . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #51:1>
&lsquo; Is that what someone said to you , all those years ago after Vietnam ? &rsquo; she asked bitterly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #52:1>
&lsquo; Yes , and it 's still what I have to try and do .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #53:1>
So long as you 're not alone the worst can eventually be forgotten , the best remem<l>bered . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #54:1>
Jean swallowed and nodded &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #55:1>
some things can never be forgotten , she thought but did not say .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #56:1>
He knew , and had lived much longer with the knowledge .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #57:1>
He had already turned back to the sergeant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #58:1>
An exactly judged minimum of time spared for comfort &semi; not even a hand free to touch her , while he held a gun and needed the other to brace him<l>self against rough jolts over potholes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #59:1>
They stopped soon afterwards , the clock on the Jaguar 's dash<l>board showing twenty-two minutes since they passed the guard on the main base gates .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #60:1>
By Jean 's calculation , there couldn't possibly be many more left before someone summoned sufficient daring to enter Forla 's presence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #61:1>
&lsquo; How long after that before the alarm goes out ? &rsquo; she said aloud .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #62:1>
&lsquo; After they find Forla ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #63:1>
I hope no one will get further than knocking on his door for maybe another half-hour .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #64:1>
Then they 'll be like rats in a pit until he makes sense , and you gave him one hell of a beating . &rsquo; &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #65:1>
They had pulled in behind some corrugated shacks perhaps two hundred yards from the nearest inhabited dwelling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #66:1>
There would still be eyes watching and wondering from a distance but , briefly , there was no one close .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #67:1>
Stephen had already half-fallen out of the car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #68:1>
&lsquo; Help me change into the clothes we brought . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #69:1>
Of course the chaos when the Supreme Being was discovered tied up and concussed on the floor would be indescribable , but surely they would need to be more than just lucky to win much more time out of mere chaos ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #70:1>
Meanwhile they were wasting it changing clothes , Saul crawling under the Jaguar to drain water out of the radiator in which to wash , their two guards shaking hands before vanishing into scrub which here encroached on the edges of the city , a handful of Lewis 's dollars each and congratula<l>tions to the sergeant , who deserved to go far in anyone 's Mananga .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #71:1>
Rumour and counter-rumour must be blowing like a storm through the alleys they had used to reach here , and as soon as they pulled away again curious people would come to stare where they had been , to jabber among themselves and by doing so set pursuit back on their scent .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #72:1>
Stephen was swaying as she and Saul stripped off his bloodied clothes &semi; giddily shaved in rusty water , insisted that she washed too and brushed her hair with the Jaguar 's carpet brush .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #73:1>
Jean stared at the dirty bandaging around his thigh ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #74:1>
probably there was a bullet in him somewhere , but when she tried to protest he told her brusquely to pad and cover where the blood was seeping through and leave everything else alone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #75:1>
Her memory cringed afresh as she remembered how his torn flesh had felt under her stabbing fingers , the beginnings of abject apology confusing everything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #76:1>
&lsquo; Jesus , &rsquo; he said roughly , &lsquo; don't start apologising for other men 's dirt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #77:1>
You 've done so much ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #78:1>
I can't believe how much you 've done .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #79:1>
Saul - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #80:1>
&lsquo; I am here , &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #81:1>
Saul was using his shirt to wad that wound tighter , so that blood wouldn't seep through Lewis 's trousers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #82:1>
&lsquo; You have ... somewhere to go ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #83:1>
He nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #84:1>
&lsquo; My mother . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #85:1>
&lsquo; You could have reached her ... if you had gone when we were caught . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #86:1>
Stephen was beginning to have difficulty with his voice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #87:1>
&lsquo; I do not run , &rsquo; he answered stiffly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #88:1>
Stephen nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #89:1>
&lsquo; You waited to see if you could help us . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #90:1>
He flipped a hand .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #91:1>
&lsquo; It was not a good hope . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #92:1>
&lsquo; It was a very brave hope ... but please go now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #93:1>
Quickly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #94:1>
Man<l>anga needs its courageous sons . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #95:1>
Saul bit his lips in embarrassment , shook hands and accepted some of Lewis 's dollars , although he would have been insulted if Stephen had offered his own .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #96:1>
He lagged away a few steps , then came back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #97:1>
&lsquo; I do not wish to leave you for Forla to find . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #98:1>
Stephen straightened unsteadily and gave him a push .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #99:1>
&lsquo; Forla isn't going to get us , okay ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #100:1>
This time he went , looking over his shoulder all the way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #101:1>
&lsquo; Oh God , I hope he stays safe , &rsquo; Jean said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #102:1>
&lsquo; I hope we make it , too . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #103:1>
He glanced at the clock on the Jaguar 's dashboard .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #104:1>
Surely , by now Forla must be found , troops be falling over themselves in panic before some order was restored .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #105:1>
Stephen half fell into the car , leaned back , eyes closed &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #106:1>
if he had not been speaklng rationally a moment before she would have thought him unconscious .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #107:1>
Without opening his eyes , he added thickly , &lsquo; You drive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #108:1>
Fast , for the airport .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #109:1>
Keep to these slum lots , across scrub if you can .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #110:1>
It 's this side of town . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #111:1>
Jean started the engine , feeling sick .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #112:1>
&lsquo; For God 's sake ... the airport ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #113:1>
&lsquo; You did pick your passport off the floor ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #114:1>
She nodded , their tyres howling on hot surfaces as she cornered past some fighting dogs , jounced across ruts edged by shacks and derelict hardware .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #115:1>
&lsquo; We have to risk the early morning flight we saw yesterday .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #116:1>
Anderson had a return ticket .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #117:1>
Money in his billfold to buy you one at the desk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #118:1>
We bribe whoever needs to be bribed to get on that plane before anyone thinks we might try anything so crazy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #119:1>
Jean glanced down at her dirty jeans and stained shirt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #120:1>
There was blood spattered there as well as dirt , and Stephen 's hasty shave and change into Lewis 's trousers and jacket , Forla 's shirt , only emphasised the shocking contrast with his bruised , drained face .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #121:1>
&lsquo; There are bound to be guards at the checkout , whether the alarm is out for us or not .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #122:1>
We 'll never get past looking how we do . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #123:1>
&lsquo; Then we have to clean up some more , &rsquo; he answered grimly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #124:1>
&lsquo; There will be washrooms at the airport ... even if the drains don't work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #125:1>
People pestering passengers to buy local products , peasant skirts , things like that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #126:1>
You dress in those , they 'll only think you screwy like other foreigners . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #127:1>
&lsquo; But - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #128:1>
&lsquo; We haven't any choice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #129:1>
You 're a nurse ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #130:1>
you know how quickly wounds get infected in a place like this .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #131:1>
I shall have a fever by tonight , blood poisoning soon after .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #132:1>
Neither of us can last much longer ... much less walk to a frontier across the hills .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #133:1>
It has to be the airport . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #134:1>
Jean could think of so many objections she didn't know where to begin , except of course he was right .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #135:1>
When they broke out of the base she had known that even shot full of painkiller he couldn't last more than hours &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #136:1>
both of them were exhausted beyond belief .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #137:1>
All her experience agreed with his analysis , and if they didn't get out today then probably he would be too delirious to try tomorrow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #138:1>
By then , anyway , the airport would long since be closed against them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #139:1>
Refuge in the US or British embassies was not worth thinking about , when both were situated in the middle of town where patrols must surely intercept them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #140:1>
Western diplomats might dis<l>like dealing with dictators , but seldom stuck their necks out to oppose their methods .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #141:1>
She was also guilty of murder and both of them of assaulting the Manangan head of state and associating with guerrillas &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #142:1>
legal representation at a rigged trial was the best they could hope for if they should somehow reach inside the diplomatic compound .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #143:1>
The blue Jaguar had never felt more conspicuous as they left the city behind and scorched across open plain , jinking between spiky bushes for whatever cover they might offer , avoiding using a road until they were less than half a mile from the airport .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #144:1>
But when they finally lurched up on to the grandiose four-lane highway which led from Mananga City to the air terminal , there was very little other traffic and Jean fancied she could hear sirens behind her in the distant streets .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #145:1>
The airport was certain to be guarded whatever the state of alert , her worst fears confirmed when an armoured gun-carrier swung across the road just as they reached its outer gate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #146:1>
But the soldiers were talking among themselves and only stared because a woman was driving such a splendid car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #147:1>
They came so close to stare that Jean was forced off the tarmac and into garbage lying beside the road , the soldiers drumming on armourplate in delight because a woman had been shoved in the ditch where she belonged .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #148:1>
But at least any alert flashed into the streets of Mananga did not seem to have reached the airport yet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #149:1>
Those soldiers would not forget them , though .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #150:1>
&lsquo; Anderson had some high-powered security clearances in his billfold , &rsquo; Stephen was saying , and Jean wasn't sure he had even noticed that armoured carrier .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #151:1>
&lsquo; They should help get us past the checkout ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #152:1>
I have to use his passport too . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #153:1>
&lsquo; You don't look in the least like him ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #154:1>
Using a false passport seemed a quite lunatic and unnecessary chance to take .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #155:1>
&lsquo; Then I have to bluff .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #156:1>
Even three months ago Mananga airport was full of bureaucratic bastards looking for trouble .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #157:1>
Bags taken apart .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #158:1>
Body searches at the slightest excuse .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #159:1>
They see us ... really look ... we 'd be stripped at once and I could never explain a bullet in the thigh .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #160:1>
You must be badly bruised - &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #161:1>
Jean nodded .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #162:1>
Her shoulder hurt fiercely , her whole body ached and a rib felt as if it might be cracked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #163:1>
&lsquo; They won't like that , and if you feel like me ... you couldn't face being stripped by Manangans anyhow . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #164:1>
She nodded again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #165:1>
Even the idea of more rough hands , more jeering humiliation made her want to vomit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #166:1>
&lsquo; So we have to stop them looking ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #167:1>
Anderson 's papers are the only way we might . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-015 #X168:1>

9
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #2:1>
While Isobel Lennox sleeps , downstairs in the Villa Cellini the Goldmans are telling jokes again partly in order to relieve tension .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #3:1>
It would have been difficult for them not to be aware that a number of sinister events had occurred lately in the Villa Cellini .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #4:1>
First , Carla Dichter 's death .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #5:1>
Second , poor Mrs Lennox 's collapse while out for a walk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #6:1>
Third ( though it had started happening some days before ) , Martha Kraus 's incipient crazi<l>ness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #7:1>
Goldman himself had been the person to take Tom Kraus on one side and advise him to get some medication to calm his wife down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #8:1>
A local doctor with excellent English had been summoned , and a prescription obtained .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #9:1>
As a consequence , Martha now also sleeps , though not peacefully , beneath a fifteenth century tapestry depicting a leopard in flight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #10:1>
Tom Kraus has examined his medical insurance carefully , in case he needs to have Martha committed to a psychiatric institution in Italy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #11:1>
Goldman warned him - and Simons had echoed this - that psychiatric diagnoses are different in Italy from elsewhere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #12:1>
Italians are much less prone to administer - or receive - a label of anxiety neurosis than many other nations &semi; which doesn't stop them swallowing some twenty thousand sets of tranquillizers , hypnotic and sedative agents every year .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #13:1>
These figures are supplied by Goldman , who goes on to speculate about the lack of consistency in international diagnostic and prescribing patterns , and particularly the fact that diseases of the digestive system are four times as popular in Italy as in France .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #14:1>
The inquest on Carla Dichter has been held :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #15:1>
death by misad<l>venture .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #16:1>
As Tomaso Lucca said , &lsquo; There was no evidence to suggest that anything else had happened &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #17:1>
The Luccas have been marvellous , doing all the communicating with the police , going with Hugo to the mortuary to identify the body , and now helping him to make funeral arrangements .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #18:1>
The Dichters live in West Berlin .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #19:1>
Carla 's broken body will be transported there , where her husband 's family will gather to mourn her passing , and even more cogently the fact that none of them had taken any trouble to get to know her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #20:1>
Her life , exquisitely formed and with such promise , has been wasted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #21:1>
And then poor Mrs Lennox .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #22:1>
Hugo Dichter and Isaac Simons had found her &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #23:1>
they 'd both been out walking separately on the promontory that afternoon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #24:1>
She 'd apparently been lying uncon<l>scious in the tunnel Olivia Vereno had had constructed in the rock as one of several follies that gave the estate its air of careful grandeur .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #25:1>
Simons had run down to the villa to get help &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #26:1>
Dichter had stayed with Mrs Lennox .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #27:1>
She 'd come to , before the house staff arrived with the stretcher (
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #28:1>
as its brochure said , the Villa Cellini was in every way well-equipped ) .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #29:1>
Dichter had told the Luccas what Mrs Lennox had said - that Isaac Simons had attacked her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #30:1>
Neither he nor the Luccas had mentioned any<l>thing to Simons .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #31:1>
Hugo was locked in his own personal tragedy :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #32:1>
he couldn't really be expected to lose himself in another .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #33:1>
The Luccas were shocked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #34:1>
Mrs Lennox had seemed such an ordi<l>nary , nice woman ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #35:1>
Isaac Simons , the epitome of the English professional man , courteous , charming , sensitive , cultured , wise .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #36:1>
They had noticed ( as everyone had ) how Mrs Lennox and Mr Simons had increasingly sought each other out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #37:1>
However , they had supposed this to be natural .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #38:1>
These two were the only two single people there , and they were both English .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #39:1>
&lsquo; What do we do about this ? &rsquo; Tomaso had asked his wife .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #40:1>
&lsquo; Do we tell Simons ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #41:1>
Do we call the police again ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #42:1>
What will all this do to the Villa Cellini 's reputation ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #43:1>
There had already been a stream of reporters up the hill in connection with Carla 's death .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #44:1>
Even a German national newspaper had been in touch with the Villa Cellini office .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #45:1>
&lsquo; We 'll put her to bed , &rsquo; said Gina Lucca , &lsquo; with a sedative .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #46:1>
Call Dr Lorenzo again . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #47:1>
They did , and he prescribed more pills .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #48:1>
&lsquo; And then perhaps , &rsquo; said Gina wisely , &lsquo; perhaps she won't remember what she said ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #49:1>
Or perhaps she 'll say something different . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #50:1>
It is in such practical ministrations that Gina expresses her mater<l>nalism , having chosen to be salaried for it rather than procreat<l>ing herself , as her fecund family have done .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #51:1>
The more progeny they have , the more she cares for the historical estates of the Villa Cellini , feeling hers to be a more authentic contribution to the future than theirs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #52:1>
Tomaso takes himself off to church at this point .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #53:1>
He hasn't been for some time , and he has the feeling it won't do any harm to go to confession now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #54:1>
He finds Gina 's sagacity disturbing , not enough of a refuge for his own anxious concern about what 's really going on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #55:1>
That night in the Villa Cellini , the Goldmans get into their queen-sized bed and decide to have sexual intercourse as a change from the other kind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #56:1>
It isn't a common event for them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #57:1>
&lsquo; Never mind , dear , &rsquo; sighs Caroline , helping John Goldman to climb off her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #58:1>
With all this death around she 's becoming frightened of exertion anyway .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #59:1>
She rearranges her nightdress and falls asleep almost immediately , thinking about how nice and safe she is lying here next to her husband .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #60:1>
Who himself lies awake for some time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #61:1>
The impotence doesn't trouble him particularly &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #62:1>
it would if Caroline minded or anyone else knew about it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #63:1>
One can't have everything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #64:1>
And he has a lot : wit , humour , intelligence , a distinguished career , a large verandahed house in Santa Barbara &semi; Caroline , the golden Caroline as his wife : a son about to finish medical school .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #65:1>
Josh fancies neuro<l>surgery .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #66:1>
His parents are gratified .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #67:1>
No , other things are causing Professor Goldman 's insomnia .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #68:1>
The menacing chain of events at the villa &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #69:1>
does some sort of curse hang over the place ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #70:1>
Even as he formulates the question to himself , he says in response : absurd !
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #71:1>
He , a man of science , considering a curse !
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #72:1>
Besides which , there 's distinct evidence to the contrary .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #73:1>
Hasn't he just been reading Manzoni 's The Betrothed , an account of how they kept the bubonic plague away from these parts by dint of determination , good management , geography and the luck of the gods ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #74:1>
Of the three events that have happened in the villa recently , Goldman is most perturbed by what happened to Mrs Lennox .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #75:1>
Such a sane , balanced , albeit boring woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #76:1>
In the time they 've been here he 's seen her relax , get into the swing of things .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #77:1>
But then she 'd been through a hard time with her mother 's death .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #78:1>
Caroline had told him she had a daughter with problems , too &semi; that her husband had left her when the child was very young .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #79:1>
It couldn't have been easy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #80:1>
What was that he 'd overheard Isaac saying the other night ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #81:1>
John Goldman overhears most things ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #82:1>
he regards it as his mission in life to tune into all available dialogues on the chance that he himself might be able to enrich them .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #83:1>
He thought he 'd heard Isaac Simons say that Mrs Lennox 's mother isn't really dead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #84:1>
Perhaps that was some kind of clever psychoanalytic comment :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #85:1>
&lsquo; the mother in you is your mother surviving &rsquo; , for instance .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #86:1>
Mrs Lennox does have this strange aspect to her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #87:1>
Sometimes she looks so maternal ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #88:1>
sometimes her whole stance and bodily and facial expressions suggest someone still considering whether to grow up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #89:1>
No one has been very clear about what happened this afternoon to Mrs Lennox up there on the promontory .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #90:1>
Gina Lucca said she 'd had some sort of nervous collapse .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #91:1>
Dichter and Simons had come down with the stretcher to the house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #92:1>
They 'd looked like funeral attendants - but then that 's what Dichter is at the moment , he supposes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #93:1>
Next door , Hugo Dichter paces up and down his room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #94:1>
He 's halfway through a bottle of the best cognac the villa has - courtesy of Gina and Tomaso Lucca , who are being so kind to him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #95:1>
He 'd loved Carla , but she was so restless , a roaming soul .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #96:1>
He suspected she wanted something from him he couldn't give or didn't even know about .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #97:1>
The night of the accident she 'd been upset , distracted - no , upset :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #98:1>
after dinner , she hadn't been able to settle to anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #99:1>
They 'd started a game of poker with the Moores in the library , but she 'd tried some Schubert on the compact disc player , and then the novel she was reading , Julian Barnes , Staring at the Sun .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #100:1>
Being a philosopher , she was fasci<l>nated by the idea of TAT - the absolute truth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #101:1>
She 'd turned to him , &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #102:1>
What 's the absolute truth about us , Hugo ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #103:1>
&lsquo; How do you mean ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #104:1>
He 'd been sitting at the desk in the window correcting the page proofs of his next book of poems .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #105:1>
&lsquo; Are we happy , Hugo ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #106:1>
He 'd suppressed a feeling of impatience .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #107:1>
He wanted to get on with his work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #108:1>
But he 'd put his pen down and looked at her and said carefully , &lsquo; Of course we 're happy , darling .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #109:1>
I love you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #110:1>
You love me , don't you ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #111:1>
We 're having a wonderful time here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #112:1>
We have no obvious problems .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #113:1>
We have a nice flat , you have your job which you enjoy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #114:1>
You may be having a few problems finding a publisher for your thesis , but you 'll find one in the end .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #115:1>
It 'll be Christmas soon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #116:1>
You like Christmas , don't you :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #117:1>
remember last year , when you saw the Christmas lights in the Kurf&uumlaut;rstenda for the first time ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #118:1>
She 'd put Staring at the Sun down on the bed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #119:1>
&lsquo; Well , I 'm not happy , Hugo .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #120:1>
I 'm not happy at all ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #121:1>
And she 'd started to put her coat on and he 'd said , &lsquo; Where are you going ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #122:1>
can I come with you ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #123:1>
And she 'd pushed him away and walked off into the night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #124:1>
He 'd worked on his poems until about three .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #125:1>
She hadn't come back , but he 'd known her go off like this before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #126:1>
Her bouts of instability endeared her to him , actually .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #127:1>
He 'd even slept , waiting for her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #128:1>
But he couldn't now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #129:1>
Sleep would elude him for some time , he imagined .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #130:1>
The hardest part was to believe that Carla 's death had been accidental .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #131:1>
She wasn't a careless person .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #132:1>
She knew , she always knew , exactly what she was doing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #133:1>
He wasn't denying that she was upset - no , her distress was quite genuine , but she was consciously constructing something of it , turning it into an episode that would lead her out into the night and then back again probably for an argument and then some kind of reconciliation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #134:1>
She 'd probably even use it for some philosophical dispute .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #135:1>
It was like being married to a novelist ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #136:1>
he never knew when something he said or did would be reborn in one of her speeches .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #137:1>
That 's what he 'd expected : that she 'd come back and they 'd have a drink or two and she 'd shout at him ( he worried about the Goldmans hearing , the walls were like cardboard ) then it 'd be over - until the next time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #138:1>
He goes over to her side of the bed and pulls back the pillow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #139:1>
Her blue nightdress lies there , folded by the maid the morning before last .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #140:1>
He picks it up and buries his face in it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #141:1>
Its scents , redolent of her , make him feel quite sure that she hadn't meant to do this to him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #142:1>
No , someone had caused her to fall over that cliff .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #143:1>
That 's it :
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #144:1>
someone else had done it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #145:1>
Isaac Simons ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #146:1>
Hugo thinks of Isaac because of what Mrs Lennox had said , when he 'd had those few moments alone with her on the promontory .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #147:1>
&lsquo; He attacked me , &rsquo; she 'd said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #148:1>
&lsquo; Isaac Simons attacked me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #149:1>
I went out for a walk ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #150:1>
I wanted to see where Carla had fallen , and he came up behind me ... &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #151:1>
Hugo has taken a dislike to Isaac Simons , but it isn't personal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #152:1>
He merely has a thoroughly Germanic dislike of anything to do with Freud .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #153:1>
Still , it wouldn't have occurred to him to consider Isaac Simons a pusher of women over cliffs or into tunnels .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #154:1>
That 's where he 'd found Mrs Lennox ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #155:1>
in the tunnel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #156:1>
He 'd come into it from one end and seen a figure against the light at the other end &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #157:1>
you had to walk halfway along it until it curved sufficiently for you to see the light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #158:1>
The figure had been Isaac Simons , standing over something on the ground which , it transpired , was Mrs Lennox .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #159:1>
The man had acted quite naturally , saying , &lsquo; Look what I 've found ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #160:1>
something has happened to Mrs Lennox ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #161:1>
we must get help &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #162:1>
but then , in retrospect , perhaps there had been tell-tale signs of guilt ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #163:1>
An underlying panic in the way the words were aspirated ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #164:1>
a few beads of sweat rather than condensation from the tunnel roof , on Isaac 's forehead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #165:1>
There was the question of motives , which didn't bear thinking about , for how could Isaac Simons possibly have a reasonable motive for killing Hugo 's own wife and then attacking Mrs Lennox ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #166:1>
The only motive could be an insane hatred of women .
<ICE-GB:W2F-016 #167:1>
Who was Isaac Simons , anyway ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #1:1>
I
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #2:1>
Her first memories were shouts of &lsquo; Pig , Pig , Pig ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #3:1>
The word echoed through her childhood whenever her mother and two elder sisters wanted anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #4:1>
If an upstairs book was needed , she was sent .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #5:1>
If there was no room in the car on a visit to a local beauty spot , Pig was left behind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #6:1>
She always wore her elder sisters ' clothes , and was often given their old toys .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #7:1>
After she had passed her driving test , if a hamper had to be fetched from the station , she fetched it &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #8:1>
if an important registered letter had to be posted , Pig posted it &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #9:1>
if a dog had to be taken to the vet , Pig , smiling amiably , took it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #10:1>
A witty cousin said , &lsquo; Poor Pig is always sent on with the luggage . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #11:1>
She was not piteous , enjoyed life and spent a good deal of time talking to servants , first in Sheffield , later in London and later still in her father 's country house on the outskirts of Esher .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #12:1>
After all , anything was better than reading .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #13:1>
She always fell in with any plan for excursions or picnics ( although she was always expected to pack up the picnic basket ) .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #14:1>
In short , she was one of those happy natures who find life &lsquo; fun &rsquo; and never take offence if they are asked out to dinner at six o'clock .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #15:1>
She won her nickname when she was born with a thicket of coarse blond hair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #16:1>
Directly she saw the new baby , her older sister , Cosima , said in a scornful voice , &lsquo; Oh , Mummy , she looks like a little pig ! &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #17:1>
The name stuck .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #18:1>
Pig did not mind ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #19:1>
she was easily amused .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #20:1>
If anybody started giggling she could not help joining in , although she often had no idea what she was laughing at .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #21:1>
If an old woman tripped over a stool she had to rush out of the room and stuff a handkerchief in her mouth to avoid exploding with mirth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #22:1>
She tried not to offend anybody if she could help it , but when her uncle fell over skating and broke his ankle , she collapsed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #23:1>
Nothing put her out &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #24:1>
she accepted with good natured placidity the slavery of her adolescent years when her family , with the one exception of her father , Alistair , bossed her around .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #25:1>
If he wanted anything he asked the nearest girl and firmly called his youngest daughter Pamela , never Pig .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #26:1>
But the servants called her Miss Pig to her face and &lsquo; that pig &rsquo; behind her back .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #27:1>
Her father 's success worried her &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #28:1>
she could not help noticing that her mother and sisters changed , put on airs , annually made new friends and dropped old ones .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #29:1>
Her life would have confused a less complicated , good-natured girl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #30:1>
Her grandfather , the first AIistair MacIntosh , had been , she was told as a child , kidnapped and shipped to the Argentine .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #31:1>
Whether this was true , she never knew .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #32:1>
Her father was vague and embarrassed about the legend , while her mother dismissed it as nonsense .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #33:1>
But undoubtedly Alistair had gone to South America , when he was only fifteen , to work as a navvy on the railway network then beginning to cover the virgin lands .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #34:1>
He was a hard<l>working , serious boy , who only got drunk on New Year 's Eve and soon won the overseer 's respect and was pro<l>moted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #35:1>
He had the ability to understand figures and , at a very early age , earned a good salary which he saved and annually invested .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #36:1>
When he was thirty-five he married a fellow ex-patriot Scottish girl .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #37:1>
They built a small ranch house which his wife turned into a vignette of the suburbs of Glasgow with lace curtains , a picture of Queen Victoria and an aspidistra in the window .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #38:1>
His heart remained in his homeland where he sent his only son , Alistair , aged eighteen , to finish his education at &lsquo; The University &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #39:1>
It was a shock to the boy , used to the endless pampas , to be confined in 1886 to the foggy valley beneath the stark Edinburgh castle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #40:1>
He was homesick all his life for the empty lands he had known in his youth , when he could ride thirty miles in any direction without crossing a road .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #41:1>
The elder Alistair kept in touch with his schoolboy friends , some of whom had been as successful in England and Scotland as he had been in South America .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #42:1>
They kept an eye on the boy &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #43:1>
when he won a good degree they saw that he was well placed in one of their Sheffield steelworks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #44:1>
The second Alistair , like his father , started at the bottom and could say , and often did , that he had worked in every department of John Osbourne &ampersand; Co .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #45:1>
He had his family 's virtues :
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #46:1>
in 1914 he became the chairman of a large company .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #47:1>
At this period of the war , many complaints came back from the front of dud shells , bombs and ammunition , none of which were ever traced back to his firm .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #48:1>
A down to earth man , with a clear mind , he was chosen to be a member of a committee Lloyd George set up to increase the efficiency of the manufacturers of armaments .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #49:1>
From then on he was marked down by Whitehall as an ideal committee man .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #50:1>
His new position ensured that , for the first time in his life , he frequently visited London .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #51:1>
His wife and family remained in Sheffield .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #52:1>
He was forty-eight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #53:1>
Sixteen years before he had married Jessie , the pretty , musical , ambitious daughter of a Sheffield clergyman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #54:1>
They had four children .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #55:1>
She picked her husband out as a man who would succeed , and take her away from the uncivilised , smoky town where , she was sure , her good taste and sensibilities were wasted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #56:1>
Jessie had a long wait .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #57:1>
A son , Alistair , was born in 1900 .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #58:1>
Cosima , called after Wagner 's wife , in 1903 , Cecily in 1906 and Pamela in 1912 .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #59:1>
The MacIntosh home , originally in the country three miles from Sheffield , was a large Victorian stone house , enclosed in one and a half acres of ground .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #60:1>
The Beardsley drawings in her bedroom shocked their friends .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #61:1>
Gradually the countryside disappeared until the house was surrounded by buildings , but the garden with its tennis court was big enough to reserve the owners ' privacy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #62:1>
The second Alistair was a large , impressive man , with a square face , a blunt nose and a slit of a mouth , contra<l>dicted by large brown eyes which appeared to be good naturedly looking into the future .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #63:1>
He was sound and practical , expressed himself slowly and learned to be the last speaker at committee meetings .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #64:1>
After the war he went back to live in Sheffield .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #65:1>
His elder daughters , nine and six years older than Pig , grew up in the town with girlfriends whose fathers were members of the local cabal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #66:1>
They seldom went to London where their father stayed in the Pall Mall Club .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #67:1>
Jessie constantly pestered him to buy a town house , saying it was unfair to constrict the lives of his eldest daughters .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #68:1>
The girls were not unhappy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #69:1>
They went to numerous local dances and parties and their tennis court ensured jolly afternoons when the sun peered through the smoke .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #70:1>
Neither of the two eldest girls were pretty but were kindly described as &lsquo; good-looking &rsquo; &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #71:1>
each of them married when they were twenty .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #72:1>
Cosima in 1923 and Cecily in 1926 .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #73:1>
In the same year their father was knighted for &lsquo; services to industry &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #74:1>
Their husbands never thought of leaving Sheffield , where they intended to suc<l>ceed in &lsquo; steel &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #75:1>
In 1929 the even tenor of their provincial life was broken .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #76:1>
At the age of sixty , Alistair MacIntosh was , to his surprise , given a peerage in the New Year 's Honours List and informed he would , after the General Election , be made a junior minister .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #77:1>
Unfortunately , the Conservative Party was defeated and Ramsay Macdonald became the Labour Prime Minister .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #78:1>
His administration , undermined by the slump , only lasted two years &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #79:1>
he then became a Conservative puppet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #80:1>
In 1931 Lord MacIntosh was asked to chair a committee to recommend and implement meth<l>ods by which business confidence could be regained .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #81:1>
After twenty-nine years Jessie believed she had reached her Eldorado .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #82:1>
The family bought a house in Park Street , London , and another converted Tudor farmhouse near Esher .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #83:1>
Pig 's elder brother was given , and lived in , the Sheffield house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #84:1>
To her surprise and her sisters ' annoyance Pig was told in 1931 she would be presented at Court by Lady Hammond-Graeme , who made her living out of the daughters of the nouveaux riches .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #85:1>
This lady had a com<l>manding presence , a hooked nose , minute eyes and an attentive little husband about half her size , often described as her little dog .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #86:1>
She never allowed him to be more than a foot away from her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #87:1>
The great day of the year was Queen Charlotte 's Ball where she organised and paraded ambitious debutantes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #88:1>
Her charges were prepared like cattle for an agricultural show .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #89:1>
Plain debutantes from Lancashire and the Midlands had eyebrows plucked , hair re-arranged in the latest fashion , and flattering photographs taken by Cecil Beaton .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #90:1>
Photographs of them appeared in the three smart social weeklies , The Tatler , The Bystander , and the Sketch , with whom Lady Hammond-Graeme had many complicated financial arrangements .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #91:1>
The duenna was expensive but , as she pointed out , &lsquo; if a girl is to marry well she must be seen &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #92:1>
She gave dinners paid for by parents , saw that young men danced with her charges at balls , told her pupils to be careful , dutiful , polite and firmly not to drink too much or dance too often with the same young man .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #93:1>
It must be admitted the last temptation was seldom a problem for Pig .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #94:1>
Occasionally she was asked , due to their father 's importance , and much to Lady Hammond-Graeme 's annoyance , to select , aristo<l>cratic balls .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #95:1>
Lady Hammond-Graeme often told Pig she laughed and spoke too loudly to be a social success and insisted that when she was amused , she should not throw back her head , open her mouth and roar with laughter , but smile elegantly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #96:1>
Her stiff young escorts soon decided that with her red face and coarse flaxen hair , it was unlikely she would marry well .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #97:1>
Her dowry was known to be only twenty thousand pounds .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #98:1>
She did have a few young , amusing , badly behaved , well born friends , who were amused by her infectious enthusiasm and pleased with the MacIntosh house in which her mother gave dinner and luncheon parties and the type of musical evenings which had seemed smart in Sheffield .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #99:1>
Sadly they were considered side-splittingly funny in Mayfair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #100:1>
Pig 's friends ' ambition was to make a nervous , forty-year-old , thin violinist from Hungary with long , black hair laugh or cry by making faces at him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #101:1>
One day they succeeded &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #102:1>
he put down his violin and stood , both hands hiding his eyes , in tears .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #103:1>
He was dismissed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #104:1>
Her friends said , &lsquo; It 's the end of the chase ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #105:1>
we have killed our fox . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #106:1>
Pig found herself worrying if he had a wife and children .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #107:1>
She accepted without bitterness that it was her fate to receive stopgap invitations for dinner and replace at the last moment sick guests at weekends in grand houses .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #108:1>
She was also a good tease for conventional mothers who were horrified at her loudness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #109:1>
When Pig was nineteen she had an unhappy experience with a good-looking young man who had a bet he would seduce her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #110:1>
To her delighted surprise he danced with her all one evening , sent cut flowers the next day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #111:1>
He asked her to lunch , gazed into her eyes , told her he loved her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #112:1>
His friends conspired to make her drunk .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #113:1>
A weekend later he crept into her bedroom and won his bet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #114:1>
She felt guilty the next day , miserable the following week as she sat waiting in vain for a telephone call .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #115:1>
A good friend told her about the bet ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #116:1>
she went to Sheffield , cried for five days and decided it was not the end of the world :
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #117:1>
her good spirits won and she returned to London .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #118:1>
The incident made her cautious of her dancing partners and all young men .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #119:1>
But afterwards she thought her experience had been worth it ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #120:1>
her lover had looked so beautiful .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #121:1>
She was not unhappy but regretted she had not fulfilled her mother 's hopes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-017 #122:1>
Later on it was rumoured that &lsquo; she was good natured &rsquo; .

FIFTY-THREE
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #6:1>
Cosmo locked his briefcase in the boot and got into his car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #7:1>
Although this was the third or fourth car since his divorce , he rolled the window down to let air in and any residue of scent out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #8:1>
He opened the window from habit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #9:1>
On the rare occasions he thought of Joyce , it was to reproach himself for stupidity .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #10:1>
There 's no surer way to lose a good friend than to marry her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #11:1>
High-spirited , bouncy , generous Joyce had in middle age and close proximity become a bore &semi; and as for sex , so good in experimental and lusty youth , that had switched to something akin to aerobics .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #12:1>
But now , after the Bodmin Assizes , he had a free weekend .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #13:1>
He would dawdle back to London , bird-watch on the way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #14:1>
Should he head for Slapton Ley and the Exe Estuary for migratory birds , or chance the cliffs of North Devon ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #15:1>
He drove as far as Launceston enjoying his indecision .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #16:1>
It was agreeable , he thought , to have no ties , not to have to rush back to wife and family as did , for instance , Hubert , always in a hurry to fit in the children 's holidays or Venice or Paris because Victoria must go between the children 's half-terms , and still constantly travel for his own work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #17:1>
No wonder he was threatened with ulcers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #18:1>
Cosmo rolled up the window .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #19:1>
Heavy rain squalls hit the windscreen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #20:1>
Late September brought equinoctial gales &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #21:1>
the north coast might be too rough .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #22:1>
He would cut south from Launceston &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #23:1>
stay in a pub , perhaps ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #24:1>
He could spend the night at Pengappah .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #25:1>
He was welcome , as were all Hubert 's friends , to collect the key in the village and make himself at home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #26:1>
But I am not at home there , Cosmo thought irritably .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #27:1>
I have never felt at home since Flora told me she had heard us discussing her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #28:1>
Then he thought , It is eighteen years since that happened .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #29:1>
Hubert is married and has found success &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #30:1>
I have married and divorced &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #31:1>
I have a good practice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #32:1>
I have no room for sentimentality .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #33:1>
I must take a pull and be sensible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #34:1>
Thinking this , Cosmo remembered his father .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #35:1>
Had he not , during that awful row that Christmas at Coppermalt ( patched up , of course , but unforgettable ) , said something about Flo<l>ra being sensible ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #36:1>
One wondered , thought Cosmo , driving through the rain , who under their veneer of ordinariness was sensible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #37:1>
I cannot claim good sense , he thought &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #38:1>
it was stupid to marry Joyce , cheaply cruel to my mother .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #39:1>
I have often been idiotic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #40:1>
Look at that trip I made to Brittany &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #41:1>
nothing could have been stupider .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #42:1>
St Malo destroyed in the war is rebuilt .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #43:1>
There is a barrage across the water where we crossed in vedettes ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #44:1>
the beach beyond St Briac is built up with villas and a concrete car park covers the site of our picnic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #45:1>
Even giving Coppermalt to Charles has not erased anything .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #46:1>
I remember the silky feel of the water when Hubert and I drifted down the river that hot day .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #47:1>
The sight of Flora undressing , and catching her unaware in the water .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #48:1>
Sometimes I hear her voice or remember the salt taste of her eyelashes when I kissed her on the last night of her visit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #49:1>
Or finding myself , as I occasionally do , getting out of a taxi at Paddington , I remember the feel of her wrist as I held her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #50:1>
It is ridiculous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #51:1>
I remember it all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #52:1>
I am fifty years old yet I am frequently tempted to seek out Irena Tarasova .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #53:1>
Nothing could be simpler but I am afraid .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #54:1>
Then he thought , more cheerfully : I make my living from other people 's lack of sense &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #55:1>
who am I to complain ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #56:1>
In the dusk a policeman flagged him down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #57:1>
There were fallen trees blocking the road &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #58:1>
it would be best for Cosmo to take the main road to Plymouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #59:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; I will wind my way round by the lanes . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #60:1>
The policeman remarked that the lanes were tricky , it was easy to get lost .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #61:1>
Cosmo replied jauntily that he was in the mood to get lost and turned the car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #62:1>
Quite lost some ten miles on , rounding a bend , he found cars parked by the side of the road and jamming a disused quarry .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #63:1>
Groups of people were straggling up a moorland path .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #64:1>
Reaching for his binoculars , Cosmo focused them on a bonfire on top of the hill , a frieze of happy and skipping children .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #65:1>
On impulse he got out of his car and started walking towards the fire .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #66:1>
As he climbed he smelled roasting lamb on the damp wind and heard harsh shouts above the cries of children .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #67:1>
He overtook a wheelchair pushed by two boys .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #68:1>
The woman in it ordered them to make haste &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #69:1>
she had an authoritative voice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #70:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; Can I lend a hand ? &rsquo; and , pushing , asked , &lsquo; What 's the picnic in aid of ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #71:1>
&lsquo; It 's not a picnic ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #72:1>
it 's a ram roast , &rsquo; said the woman in the chair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #73:1>
Cosmo felt snubbed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #74:1>
One of the lads pushing said , &lsquo; Some 'ould call it a barbecue .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #75:1>
You all right there ? &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #76:1>
He shot off at a gallop , leaving Cosmo to push .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #77:1>
&lsquo; You shouldn't have given him the chance ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #78:1>
he 's a lazy bugger , &rsquo; said his mate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #79:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; I 'm sorry . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #80:1>
&lsquo; So long as you get me up there , &rsquo; said the woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #81:1>
&lsquo; I don't want to miss anything . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #82:1>
&lsquo; What are you celebrating ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #83:1>
Cosmo ran through a few historical dates in his mind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #84:1>
&lsquo; We are not celebrating anything , &rsquo; said the woman in the chair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #85:1>
&lsquo; It 's her idea , &ldquo; A bit of fun at the end of the season , &rdquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #86:1>
She gave the lamb . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #87:1>
&lsquo; Celebrating the end of the grockle season , &rsquo; said the boy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #88:1>
&lsquo; Tourists , trippers , &rsquo; explained the woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #89:1>
&lsquo; I know what grockles are . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #90:1>
Cosmo was tempted to stop pushing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #91:1>
When they reached the top , he wondered what had possessed him to get involved .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #92:1>
He was out of breath .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #93:1>
He went and sat on a rock apart .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #94:1>
He would not stay long .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #95:1>
The woman in the wheelchair had barely said thank you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #96:1>
As well as the bonfire proper there was a second , more seriously built fire , where men were turning a sheep on a spit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #97:1>
Fat dripped into the fire which flared up , illuminating the men 's faces .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #98:1>
Young women held babies in their arms and small children by the hand &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #99:1>
the larger children and adoles<l>cents chased each other , shrieking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #100:1>
A group of older women , taking orders from the woman in the wheelchair , tried in the wind to anchor a tablecloth onto a trestle table under which crates of beer were stacked .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #101:1>
The wheelchair woman cried , &lsquo; Not like that !
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #102:1>
Do it the way I tell you . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #103:1>
Dogs ran about , getting in people 's way .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #104:1>
Some of the men in charge of the roast had started on the beer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #105:1>
Cosmo thought , This might be a scene from Breughel .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #106:1>
Then , unhappily , My thoughts are unoriginal .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #107:1>
He felt he should leave , but if he was seen leaving it would look ill-mannered &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #108:1>
he sat on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #109:1>
The sheep was presently removed from the spit amid bonhomous shouts .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #110:1>
The woman in the wheelchair screamed shrill directions but the men paid scant attention as they began to carve .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #111:1>
Soon the men were handing out chunks of meat to the crowd .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #112:1>
One detached himself and came towards Cosmo with a helping on a paper plate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #113:1>
He looked hard at Cosmo as he gave him the plate , but did not speak .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #114:1>
Cosmo felt he should offer some explanation of his presence , but the man carried a second plate which he was taking to someone behind Cosmo , beyond the firelight .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #115:1>
Cosmo had not known that there was anyone behind him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #116:1>
He had thought himself outside the circle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #117:1>
He felt self-conscious , exposed , afraid to look round .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #118:1>
He thought , This is ridiculous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #119:1>
I am fifty years old ,
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #120:1>
what have I to fear ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #121:1>
A considerable amount of drinking was now going on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #122:1>
Round the fire some of the shouts had an anarchic ring and the laughter was raucous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #123:1>
Cosmo thought again that he should leave &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #124:1>
he had not been invited .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #125:1>
Should he thank somebody ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #126:1>
Say goodbye politely ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #127:1>
Should he slink off ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #128:1>
He could perhaps thank the woman in the wheelchair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #129:1>
Had he not helped push her up the hill ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #130:1>
Was she the host ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #131:1>
Standing up , he felt cramp in his leg .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #132:1>
Stamping to rid himself of it , he turned about and saw the person behind him who had received the plate of lamb .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #133:1>
A woman sat on a rock dressed in anorak and jeans and wel<l>lington boots .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #134:1>
She had a dog at her feet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #135:1>
The dog was watching its mistress , who was watching him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #136:1>
Cosmo could not see the woman 's face but he thought , She will do .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #137:1>
I can thank this woman , apologise for gatecrashing , be on my way , make a lame explanation , sound courteous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #138:1>
As he stepped towards the woman the bonfire crackled up and he recognised Flora .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #139:1>
He must have been standing there some little time when three men detached themselves from the festivities and closed in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #140:1>
They carried mugs of beer &semi; he could smell their breath .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #141:1>
One of the men , pressing close to Cosmo , said , &lsquo; You all right , Flora ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #142:1>
Making a nuisance of himself , is he ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #143:1>
Shall us sort him out ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #144:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; It 's all right , Jim .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #145:1>
I know him . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #146:1>
Then she said to Cosmo , &lsquo; They think you may be a man from the Ministry &semi; we have not got permission to have the bonfire on this hill .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #147:1>
Are you from the Ministry ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #148:1>
Cosmo thought her voice had not changed at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #149:1>
He said , &lsquo; I am not from the Ministry . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #150:1>
The man called Jim said , &lsquo; Not a snooper , then , &rsquo; and laughed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #151:1>
He seemed a friendly sort of fellow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #152:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; But I gatecrashed your party .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #153:1>
I wanted to say goodbye and thank you , to the lady in the wheelchair perhaps ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #154:1>
She seems to be in charge . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #155:1>
Flora smiled and the men burst out laughing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #156:1>
Cosmo saw he had been mistaken .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #157:1>
He said , speaking at last to Flora , &lsquo; I 've forgotten her name . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #158:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; Everybody called her &ldquo; The Natural Leader &rdquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #159:1>
It 's a type . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #160:1>
A little puzzled , the man Jim said , &lsquo; Right then , we are going to see about the music . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #161:1>
He drifted away with his friends .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #162:1>
Flora called after him , &lsquo; Thanks , Jim . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #163:1>
By the light of the bonfire he could see her hair was still thick and dark , her teeth when she had smiled at Jim white and even .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #164:1>
He had not particularly remembered her teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #165:1>
He said , &lsquo; Portable gramophone , squeezebox ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #166:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; Pop .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #167:1>
They run it off one of the land rover 's batteries , I think .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #168:1>
I don't understand these things . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #169:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; Nor do I .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #170:1>
May I sit down for a minute ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #171:1>
I think my legs are giving way . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #172:1>
Flora made room for him on the rock .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #173:1>
The dog sniffed Cosmo 's trousers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #174:1>
Cosmo said : &lsquo; Is she called Tonton ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #175:1>
He stroked the dog .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #176:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; No . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #177:1>
Presently Cosmo said , &lsquo; There 's nothing wrong with my legs , I 'm as strong as a horse . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #178:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; Good . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #179:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; The fact is they were shaking .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #180:1>
I thought , too , that I might have a coronary . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #181:1>
She said , &lsquo; Please do not . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #182:1>
Flora 's dog leaned its chin on her knee and groaned .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #183:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; She 's terrified of the bonfire , that 's why we are sitting here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #184:1>
Some of the party had managed to get a land rover up the hill .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #185:1>
A voice said , &lsquo; Testing , testing , &rsquo; and there was a burst of the Everley Brothers .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #186:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; When those friends of yours closed in on me just now I realised what a stranger I am .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #187:1>
I was quite scared . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #188:1>
She said , &lsquo; They 'd love that . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #189:1>
She laughed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #190:1>
The Everleys sang &lsquo; Come Right Back &rsquo; , the volume wob<l>bling in the wind .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #191:1>
Flora put her mouth close to Cosmo 's ear and asked , &lsquo; And how is Joyce ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #192:1>
Her breath tickled his neck .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #193:1>
He said , &lsquo; We were only married about five minutes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #194:1>
Didn't you see our divorce in The Times ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #195:1>
&lsquo; I gave up reading The Times , &rsquo; she said .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #196:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; I have wanted to find you , but I hadn't the nerve .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #197:1>
I knew I might be able to trace you through Irena Tarasova .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #198:1>
Once I went to backtrack in Brittany , but it was horrible .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #199:1>
There wasn't a sniff of you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #200:1>
Then I thought if I did find you , you would give me the brush-off . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #201:1>
&lsquo; You brushed me off when you went to Algiers . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #202:1>
She was furious .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #203:1>
Shouting above the Beatles , Cosmo yelled , &lsquo; That was a bloody stupid mistake , you must have known it was . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #204:1>
Flora 's dog jerked itself up and bared its teeth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #205:1>
Flora said , &lsquo; I thought you were going off to get killed and wouldn't want an involvement , &rsquo; gentling the dog .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #206:1>
&lsquo; Christ ! &rsquo; Cosmo shouted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #207:1>
&lsquo; Any chance of my getting killed was long gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #208:1>
I was on my way to a desk job . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #209:1>
Flora thought , We are grown people , adults .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #210:1>
We should be managing better than this , and was silent .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #211:1>
Cosmo said , &lsquo; I remember you coming up out of the sea with that dog , carrying your clothes in a bundle .
<ICE-GB:W2F-018 #212:1>
You were pretty stroppy then . &rsquo;

Portrait Of A Woman
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #2:1>
Portrait of a woman at breakfast
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #3:1>
Cathy Kellaway is forty-nine years old and not bothered about it , any more than she is bothered about the streaks of grey in her dark hair or the grooves which are deepening at each side of her mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #4:1>
She has been up since six o'clock in order to provide her husband with a proper cooked break<l>fast before he leaves to catch the 7.10 &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #5:1>
so she is wearing the cotton dress in which she will do the housework after he has gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #6:1>
It is chosen for comfort and ease of washing rather than stylishness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #7:1>
Although she has quickly combed her hair tidy , there has been no time for the vigorous brushing neces<l>sary to bounce life into it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #8:1>
She wears no make-up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #9:1>
As always , of course , she is neat and clean , but that is the best that can be said of her appearance .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #10:1>
After twenty-nine years of marriage , she takes it for granted that Will doesn't care what she looks like at breakfast time &semi; doesn't even notice .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #11:1>
At this hour of the day her eyes are abstracted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #12:1>
It is a time when she is prone to day-dream &semi; allowing a newspaper headline to attract her attention , perhaps , and then invent<l>ing the story to go with it as she washes up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #13:1>
Or thinking of reasons , ridiculous reasons , why the milkman is late again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #14:1>
A little imagination does wonders in expelling the drabness from early-morning chores .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #15:1>
Her face becomes dreamy , soft and amorphous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #16:1>
But she is not conscious of any vagueness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #17:1>
This is a period when she hardly feels herself to exist at all .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #18:1>
Portrait of a woman at her office desk
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #19:1>
Cathy Kellaway has never held down what she would con<l>sider a regular job .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #20:1>
Early marriage , Will 's three periods of working overseas and the scattered spacing of her four chil<l>dren have combined to make thoughts of a career out of the question .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #21:1>
She chooses to spend two days each week at the local Citizens ' Advice Bureau , as a gesture of gratitude that her own life has contained so few of the problems which are brought to her by others .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #22:1>
Believing herself to be by nature unbusiness-like - for her husband deals with all the house<l>hold bills , investments and tax demands - she does her best to suggest efficiency by her appearance .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #23:1>
So for her days at the CAB she wears plain , dark colours , sometimes brightened by a white collar .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #24:1>
The shape of her clothes is neat and unfussy , flattering her figure .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #25:1>
Her tights and shoes are dark as well .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #26:1>
Although she does not realise it , this is the only time within each week when she is smartly dressed . .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #27:1>
Too much colour on her face would be inappropri<l>ate , she feels , but she wears a light foundation .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #28:1>
The encouraging smile and slight frown of concentration as she listens to each complicated complaint brings to her face an intentness which is lacking at home .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #29:1>
She has be<l>come very quick to run through her mind what her eldest daughter would call a scenario : taking hold of all the facts presented to her and silently combining them with various possibilities to consider where different ways of tackling the problem may lead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #30:1>
She has always dismissed chess as being too intellectual a game for someone like herself , but it is a chessplayer 's mind which she is bringing to bear on these situations .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #31:1>
There is usually a moment when her expression switches from sympathetic consideration to one of decisiveness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #32:1>
She may not have solved the problem , but she has settled on the best course of action .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #33:1>
Her office personality is a positive one &semi; but she is not aware of this , any more than she is conscious of her breakfast-time vagueness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #34:1>
Rarely does she reflect that her husband has no acquaint<l>ance with the adviser of citizens .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #35:1>
She changes into her office clothes only after he has left for work , and has always put them back in the wardrobe before he returns , because they seem too severe for domestic life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #36:1>
Although she longs to talk about the often extraordinary stories she hears during the day - and Will would love to listen - she regards her clients ' business as confidential .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #37:1>
From a training course and the encyclopaedic information with which the office is pro<l>vided she has learned a considerable amount about the law , the social services and local government &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #38:1>
and from the tales of incompetence , quarrels and disaster which are carried into the office she has learned a great deal about human nature &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #39:1>
but all this experience she leaves behind her when she closes the office door at the end of each session .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #40:1>
Portrait of a woman at home for the evening
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #41:1>
This is Cathy Kellaway 's world .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #42:1>
She is a home-maker &semi; a wonderful mother &semi; a marvellous cook .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #43:1>
At intervals during the past twenty-nine years she has been confronted by a house she has not chosen in a country whose language she does not yet speak and has shown herself to be a practical organiser .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #44:1>
Now , finally settled back in England , her house is clean and comfortable , her garden scented and colourful :
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #45:1>
each is tidy without being oppressively immaculate .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #46:1>
She is vivacious when she entertains and restful when her hus<l>band is tired .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #47:1>
She first fell in love with Will when she was eighteen , and she adores him still .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #48:1>
He and the girls know that they are lucky to have her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #49:1>
A successful home-maker , of course , is not necessarily an elegant woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #50:1>
The clothes which Cathy wears in the even<l>ing , whether or not guests are expected , are usually pale , too often floral , and inclined to be fussy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #51:1>
She is aware that they reveal the speed with which she has recently begun to put on weight , but somewhere in the back of her mind is the thought that it is appropriate for a wife and a mother-of-four to look &lsquo; comfortable &rsquo; .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #52:1>
She is dressing to suit her husband 's taste and , as long as he continues to tell her how nice she looks , there is no reason to change style .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #53:1>
Cathy in the even<l>ing is a contented , smiling woman who is satisfied with the way she manages her life - and has reason to be .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #54:1>
No woman is one person only .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #55:1>
In the family photograph album there is a snapshot which Cathy 's father took on the day she left home to go to university .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #56:1>
It shows an eighteen-year-old girl bright-eyed with excitement at the adventure in living and learning just about to begin - a girl who bears no resemblance at all to Cathy now .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #57:1>
Perhaps it is hardly reasonable to lament the lack of excitement in the eyes of a forty-nine-year-old woman .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #58:1>
But even amongst the much later photographs it is difficult to believe that the Cathy Kellaway picking raspberries in a sun top and shorts is the same woman as the Cathy Kellaway , matronly in one of the floral outfits , at her silver wedding party in the same year .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #59:1>
As for the severe passport photograph taken in a do-it-yourself booth to be printed in the CAB annual report , it does not qualify for inclusion in the album - and no one , of course , would ever dream of photographing Cathy Kellaway as she sits at breakfast . &star; &star; &star;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #60:1>
&lsquo; Chap in my office was fifty on Sunday , &rsquo; says Will , buttering his toast before spreading it lavishly with marmalade .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #61:1>
Un<l>like some husbands , Will is always chatty over breakfast , since he buys his daily newspaper at the station and reads it on the train .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #62:1>
&lsquo; His wife gave a surprise party for him . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #63:1>
&lsquo; In a hotel ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #64:1>
Cathy averts her eyes from the tempting but calorie-laden toast and picks at the muesli which , in the interest of weight-watching , she has chosen to buy because she dislikes it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #65:1>
&lsquo; No .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #66:1>
In their own house .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #67:1>
For fifty people . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #68:1>
Cathy , interested , puts down her spoon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #69:1>
&lsquo; How did she manage to keep it a surprise ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #70:1>
I mean , even supposing she used caterers and left everything like chairs and tables and glasses for them to provide , there are so many little things , you know , like clearing a space for people 's coats . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #71:1>
&lsquo; He did notice the flowers , apparently .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #72:1>
Marvellous flower arrangements all over the house the day before .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #73:1>
But that 's his wife 's hobby , and he just assumed she 'd made a special effort for his birthday . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #74:1>
Cathy 's mind prickles with questions .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #75:1>
How were the in<l>vitations accepted ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #76:1>
In the Kellaway household there are no secrets .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #77:1>
It is taken for granted that any letter addressed only to either Will or to Cathy herself will be passed across the breakfast table as soon as it has been read &semi; and after every telephone call the recipient will explain : &lsquo; That was Tess , to say she 'd be here by twelve . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #78:1>
Or whatever .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #79:1>
&lsquo; I suppose she used someone else 's address and phone number for the RSVP bit . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #80:1>
&lsquo; Yes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #81:1>
Their daughter 's -
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #82:1>
and of course everyone was sworn to secrecy . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #83:1>
&lsquo; It must have been tricky keeping him out of the way while everything was set up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #84:1>
First she 'd have to be sure of getting him out and then she 'd have to be sure of getting him back . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #85:1>
&lsquo; He knew that his daughter would be coming , so that would bring him home in time .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #86:1>
And to get him out in the first place his wife arranged for one of his golfing friends to suggest a round - and keep him at the club until everyone had arrived .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #87:1>
Apparently it started to pour with rain when they got to the thirteenth hole
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #88:1>
&semi; a real deluge .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #89:1>
Derek said that was the thing he found most extraordinary .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #90:1>
His friend 's a fair-weather golfer who 'd normally have made a dash for the clubhouse when things got really piggy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #91:1>
But this time he insisted on plodding on while they both got soaked . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #92:1>
&lsquo; But he enjoyed the party when he finally got to it ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #93:1>
More coffee ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #94:1>
&lsquo; Thanks .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #95:1>
Yes , tickled pink .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #96:1>
All the cars had been parked at the other end of the street , so the first he knew was when he walked into his own drawing room and ten champagne bottles all popped at once .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #97:1>
A table loaded with presents .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #98:1>
And people he hadn't seen for years .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #99:1>
He spent the whole of yesterday bubbling on about it . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #100:1>
&lsquo; Would you have liked something like that for your fif<l>tieth ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #101:1>
&lsquo; Heavens , no !
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #102:1>
You know me .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #103:1>
Not a man for surprises .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #104:1>
I must be off .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #105:1>
See you this evening . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #106:1>
&lsquo; See you this evening . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #107:1>
Not a man for surprises .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #108:1>
Cathy smiles to herself with the truth of that remark as she washes up the breakfast dishes .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #109:1>
So much is Will not a man for surprises that he is no more capable of giving them than of receiving .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #110:1>
Her own fiftieth birthday is not far away .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #111:1>
It will not be long before he asks his regular question : &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #112:1>
What would you like for your birthday ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #113:1>
However outrageous or impossible the answer , he will get her what she wants .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #114:1>
Only on one occasion , earlier in their marriage , when she asked for &lsquo; A surprise , please &rsquo; , has she seen him completely thrown , searching miserably for ideas .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #115:1>
She must not put him through that agony again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #116:1>
But instead of considering possible suggestions , Cathy finds her thoughts still concerned with the surprise party .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #117:1>
How was the guest list drawn up , she asks herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #118:1>
Suppose that she had planned such an event for Will 's fiftieth birth<l>day ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #119:1>
Who would she have asked ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #120:1>
Some answers come easily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #121:1>
Family , and the friends who are part of their normal social life , need no detective work .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #122:1>
Friends from more distant times or places can be collected from the Christmas card list .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #123:1>
Professional acquaintances ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #124:1>
Stickier ground here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #125:1>
Will is on friendly terms with some of his office colleagues but not with others .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #126:1>
Cathy knows which they are , although he never asks them home , but it would be easy to cause offence by inviting one partner and not another , or a secretary instead of someone more senior .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #127:1>
Other people deserving inclusion may not come to her mind simply because they belong to a time or sphere in which she has no part .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #128:1>
But in the little room which Will uses as his study is an address book , separate from the one which they keep in common and so battered that it must surely contain names from the whole of his life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #129:1>
It is not in any sense hidden from his wife .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #130:1>
If she has never looked inside it , that is because there is nothing she has needed to discover there .
<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #X131:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #X132:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-019 #X133:1>

<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #1:1>
FIFTEEN
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #2:1>
The fog came down just before teatime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #3:1>
She didn't leave the studios until ten , an hour after Brum Arts had come off the air .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #4:1>
When she 'd turned on to the A38 she used the red tail lights of the car in front to navigate by , but five miles from Alrewas she lost her guide .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #5:1>
Her pace slowed and an ache spread from between her shoulders .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #6:1>
Vapours swirled and banked &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #7:1>
the light of on-coming headlights drained out of the car .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #8:1>
Dimly she made out the sign to the village and crept off the dual carriageway on to the slip road .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #9:1>
The Happy Eater road<l->house was in complete darkness , but one or two lights showed in the semi-detached houses which lined the road .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #10:1>
The village itself was practically deserted .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #11:1>
Sodium street lamps burned phosphorescent holes in the fog , but as she turned off Main Street to the cottage she noticed the one which illuminated the alley was out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #12:1>
Having parked the car , she stepped into a dense moist silence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #13:1>
All the way back from Birmingham she 'd been promising herself coffee laced with brandy &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #14:1>
after depositing her bags she made it and carried it back towards the living-room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #15:1>
She poised on the threshold .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #16:1>
She caught a whiff of ... she turned her head , first right and then left ... something fetid , some<l>thing dead .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #17:1>
But now , her nostrils flared , she couldn't smell it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #18:1>
There 'd been a woman in hospital , Isobel recalled , a depressive , who 'd always imagined noxious smells &semi; herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #19:1>
She shuddered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #20:1>
Someone has been here , she suddenly thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #21:1>
Someone is here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #22:1>
It 's not my imagination .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #23:1>
Her scalp shrivelled against her skull .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #24:1>
Nonsense , she told herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #25:1>
She took large gulps of the brandy-laced coffee , looking round the living-room as she did so .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #26:1>
Nothing , so far as she could see , had been disturbed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #27:1>
She knew she would have to climb the stairs and inspect the rocking-chair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #28:1>
Her eye lighted on the poker and even as she was telling herself she was being ridiculous , she put down the coffee cup and picked it up .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #29:1>
Listen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #30:1>
Can you hear someone ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #31:1>
Something ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #32:1>
Someone is here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #33:1>
She listened .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #34:1>
She listened with her ears , with her skin &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #35:1>
her bones elongated to detect better the slightest vibration .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #36:1>
The rest of her being stretched too , reaching to the furthermost corners of the cottage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #37:1>
She could detect no sound other than the steady ticking of the grandfather clock .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #38:1>
Something though ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #39:1>
Something fishy ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #40:1>
Smelled fishy ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #41:1>
Evil , she thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #42:1>
A sense of evil .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #43:1>
What I am sensing is my own dread , she told herself .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #44:1>
I 'm frightening myself to death .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #45:1>
Fingers clenching the poker , she climbed the stairs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #46:1>
Gently , with the end of the poker , she pushed back the door into the study room .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #47:1>
The rocking-chair , illuminated in a flare of light from the landing , was empty .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #48:1>
She found herself thinking of how she 'd stood in the doorway of the nursery in the bungalow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #49:1>
We are almost reflections of each other in a mirror , she thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #50:1>
Charlie 's fruitless , dumped widows .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #51:1>
But she found she didn't feel sorry for the second Mrs Maccabee .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #52:1>
She hated the woman who 'd taken her husband from her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #53:1>
And this though she knew Charlie hadn't been taken at all , but had gone gladly .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #54:1>
He 'd have gone much sooner , too , had it not been for his devotion to his daughter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #55:1>
She remembered quite clearly that she 'd once or twice slapped Anne-Marie too hard for a minor offence , in reality punishing her for the ease with which she 'd captured and kept Charlie 's adoration .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #56:1>
Annie .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #57:1>
Limb of my limb .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #58:1>
Eye of my eye .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #59:1>
Breath of my breath .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #60:1>
She looked at the empty rocking-chair again and then at the poker .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #61:1>
Would she have hit out if she 'd found anyone here ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #62:1>
I 'd have killed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #63:1>
Suddenly , shockingly , she was in touch with her fury .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #64:1>
But no one is here .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #65:1>
I 'm furious with shadows .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #66:1>
Shades .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #67:1>
Nothing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #68:1>
Nothing to hit .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #69:1>
Nothing to murder .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #70:1>
Nothing even to be frightened of .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #71:1>
The feeling of hopelessness she 'd experienced earlier that afternoon swept over her again &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #72:1>
it silted up her eyes and gagged her mouth .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #73:1>
It buried her alive .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #74:1>
When she was able to move , to shake herself free again , she stumbled downstairs .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #75:1>
She made herself drink the rest of the coffee , though it was cold .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #76:1>
Drue had once told her that monks believed despair the ultimate sin for it was a sin against the Holy Ghost .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #77:1>
This spirit was least easily pacified for its claims were the most tenuous .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #78:1>
Despair , the sin of accidie , spiritual sloth , apathy , indiffer<l>ence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #79:1>
Missing the mark .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #80:1>
That 's what the old lady had said was the root meaning of sin .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #81:1>
People who missed their mark were furious , frustrated , impotent , hopeless .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #82:1>
Finally they despaired .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #83:1>
A failed marriage .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #84:1>
A dead child .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #85:1>
How much wider of the mark could she have been ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #86:1>
&lsquo; I was carrying on , trying to make a new life for myself and succeeding too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #87:1>
But now I can see that it was all show .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #88:1>
An act of bravado , &rsquo; she 'd told Dr Rainbow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #89:1>
But she 'd done it .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #90:1>
She 'd chosen to carry on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #91:1>
What use is despair to me now ? she thought .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #92:1>
It 's too late for despair .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #93:1>
And now she 'd experienced this burying of her being , she felt curiously relieved &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #94:1>
she felt she knew the worst .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #95:1>
She was very tired .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #96:1>
She locked the door , drew the curtains against the fog , switched out the lights and hauled her body up to bed .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #97:1>
She fell asleep as soon as her head sank into the pillow .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #98:1>
She dreamed she was on a hill overlooking Alexandria .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #99:1>
She 'd gone up there to see the rising of a star , Sirius , the brightest star in the heavens .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #100:1>
But she 'd come too early &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #101:1>
nobody else had arrived yet .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #102:1>
Her aloneness was such that it was a numbing coldness .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #103:1>
Though she was on a ridge overlooking a pre-Christian city , that ridge was the outcrop on which the church at Wychnor stood and though she didn't turn round , she knew the empty church was behind her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #104:1>
Below , slowly submerging in the canal , was something very white &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #105:1>
it dazzled like the star she 'd been waiting for .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #106:1>
She slid and tumbled down the grassy outcrop and tugged the star out of the moon-slurried waters .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #107:1>
It was the tea cloth edged in lace worked by Drue 's great-grandmother .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #108:1>
But now it was filthy &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #109:1>
it smelled of dead things and dripped with slime .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #110:1>
That a star , the brightest star in the heavens , should come to this .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #111:1>
Isobel 's grief was a terrible grief .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #112:1>
She sobbed without restraint .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #113:1>
She sobbed sitting in a chair which was turned slightly away from the trestle-table in her kitchen &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #114:1>
this table and her kitchen were in a hot , foreign city , the city of Alexandria .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #115:1>
She realized that the star cloth had once covered her table , but had been thrown away by careless people , by vandals , and drowned in the mud .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #116:1>
But she no longer sobbed because of that .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #117:1>
She sobbed because she 'd spilt something on the table and made a shocking stain on the surface .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #118:1>
Many women now sitting round the table , were furious with her for the mark would not come off .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #119:1>
She told them she would buy a new table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #120:1>
She wondered if she could afford a new one and realized , to her surprise , that she could .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #121:1>
She also knew she was being cheated .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #122:1>
She 'd buy all the women , who were her mother , this new table and they 'd still use the old one .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #123:1>
Behind her back , they 'd polish the wood so the mark didn't look quite so bad .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #124:1>
And then all the women were gone and she was alone again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #125:1>
She saw there was a different mark on another part of the table .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #126:1>
Writing had been scored into the wood with a biro .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #127:1>
To her surprise , the lettering wasn't Arabic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #128:1>
She could read it easily .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #129:1>
It was an invitation to a party .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #130:1>
She was asked by the junior flying corps to come to the celebrations they were holding that night .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #131:1>
Isobel woke from the dream as if she 'd seen the light .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #132:1>
There was a wonderful feeling of expectancy .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #133:1>
Of great things to come .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #134:1>
Oh God .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #135:1>
What was she waiting for ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #136:1>
MUMY MUMMY , I AM COMMING COMING .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #137:1>
The words taunted her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #138:1>
She knew the message must be false .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #139:1>
And yet she was again aware of the quickening of her flesh , the pain of dried up and barren places suffusing with returning life .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #140:1>
She found herself rubbing her body with her hands to assuage pins and needles .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #141:1>
Am I being tricked into healing ? she wondered .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #142:1>
Or tricked into madness ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #143:1>
When she drew back the curtains , she saw the fog had gone .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #144:1>
Mid-winter sun had not come , but the quality of the grey air tentatively suggested its imminence .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #145:1>
All through the morning , as she interviewed a group of young potters at the Ormazd Gallery , pictures of the dream kept finding her out .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #146:1>
Though she didn't want to view a star which was a sludgy tea cloth , nor a biro message written on pine , these and other dream images jumped from behind her workaday concerns to confront her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #147:1>
She didn't believe , as some scientists did , that dreams were just off-runs from a closed-down computer .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #148:1>
All manifestations of life , she felt , had validity &semi; but interpreting that which was unconscious in terms which were conscious , she thought , was trying to turn an orange into a lemon .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #149:1>
Yet the images persisted &semi;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #150:1>
it was almost as if they asked to be seen .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #151:1>
She began to wonder if this were some senseless activity devised to keep out of mind the untenable position she was in .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #152:1>
How could she wait , with ever-increasing antici<l>pation , for her dead child to come back to her ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #153:1>
Was all this hocus-pocus to ward off what was really coming ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #154:1>
The hopelessness which would silt up her eyes and gag her throat ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #155:1>
When Isobel got back to Radio Brum she didn't , as she should have , listen to the potters ' tape .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #156:1>
Instead , she picked up The Spirit of Christmas Past .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #157:1>
She 'd not discussed it with the programme organizer after all , because he 'd been tied up when she 'd come back from the clinic .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #158:1>
He 'd put it back on her desk with a note of qualified approval .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #159:1>
She was spooling the programme on to the tape machine when the phone rang .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #160:1>
&lsquo; Isobel ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #161:1>
It 's Bruno here . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #162:1>
&lsquo; What 's that frightful noise in the background ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #163:1>
&lsquo; I 'm at Euston Station .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #164:1>
I 'm taking a group of sixth formers to see the Sartre musical L'Etre et le Neant .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #165:1>
I 've been think<l>ing about Saturday morning .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #166:1>
I want to apologize to you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #167:1>
I asked you to the John Latimers &rsquo; party because I hoped I could take you out again .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #168:1>
It wasn't an excuse to bitch to someone about Caro .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #169:1>
Can you still make it on Thursday ? &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #170:1>
&lsquo; Of course I can .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #171:1>
And I didn't in the least mind you talking about Caroline . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #172:1>
&lsquo; I do .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #173:1>
Caro is over .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #174:1>
I didn't want you to think that all I wanted was a shoulder to cry on .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #175:1>
I keep thinking about you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #176:1>
I hardly stop thinking about you .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #177:1>
I keep worrying too .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #178:1>
Have the police come up with anything yet ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #179:1>
&lsquo; No . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #180:1>
&lsquo; You are all right , Isobel ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #181:1>
&lsquo; Yes . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #182:1>
&lsquo; Good .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #183:1>
I 'll see you on Thursday at around seven thirty . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #184:1>
&lsquo; I 'm glad you rang . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #185:1>
&lsquo; So am I . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #186:1>
&lsquo; Listen ...
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #187:1>
I 've some actuality to get for a tape I 'm doing .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #188:1>
I want some party atmosphere .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #189:1>
Do you think the Latimers would mind if I brought a Uher along ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #190:1>
&lsquo; A tape recorder ?
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #191:1>
I don't think so .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #192:1>
I 'll give you the school 's number .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #193:1>
You 'll catch John Latimer now if you ring .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #194:1>
He stays at school for lunch . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #195:1>
She took the number down .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #196:1>
&lsquo; Enjoy the show , &rsquo; she said as she rang off .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #197:1>
Vernon asked : &lsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #198:1>
Your Froggie 's a-wooing ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #199:1>
&lsquo; How did you know ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #200:1>
&lsquo; You went the most delicate shade of pink , sweetie .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #201:1>
Suited you , I thought . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #202:1>
John Latimer knew her .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #203:1>
&lsquo; I 'm afraid I 've always been bad at names , &rsquo; she told him for she 'd no recollection of him .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #204:1>
&lsquo; I 'll remember as soon as I see your face . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #205:1>
&lsquo; I should think there might be one or two more at the party you 'll know .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #206:1>
Betty Trumpington .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #207:1>
And Ted Hooker-Smith 's coming down from Preston .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #208:1>
He 's an art teacher .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #209:1>
He played cricket with Charlie for the Lichfield Corinthians . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #210:1>
&lsquo; I do remember Betty vaguely .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #211:1>
Plump and jolly . &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #212:1>
&lsquo; Well , bring along your tape recorder .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #213:1>
We 'll organize a whole orchestra of clinking glasses and laughter .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #214:1>
No names no pack drill ? &rsquo;
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #215:1>
&lsquo; Just a bit of party noise I want to thread through a half-hour programme on the pre-Christian origins of Christmas .
<ICE-GB:W2F-020 #216:1>
I should say the pre-Christian origins of the festivities - &rsquo;
