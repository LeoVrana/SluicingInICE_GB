# SluicingInICE_GB

The following output files are posted as the result of an investigation into the frequency of sluicing in spoken and written contexts. The initial corpus files are available as well from:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/

Also included are the Perl scripts with the regular expressions used to extract sluicing structures.
